thinking of buying what assassin's creed or
but
eh
but do you play the first few assassin's creed series
brotherhood I don't really remember playing eh no I don't think I finished brotherhood I played two

the boogeyman is out to get you
the the bugis man uh
that your ancestors were pirates ah
I don't know sia
uh huh
eh so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
orh but like of all the things a pirate ship ah that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something uh
ya
sure sure
the spur of the moment that kind of thing eh
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through lah huh
but you would think
huh
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of angmohs
but the angmohs were like you're you're so cool
ya lah he working at some burger
on the arm
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
uh huh
orh I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people ah
brand tattoos for her friends that kind ah
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first lah
ha
actually
ah like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part lah
I think like this is what tattooing feels like ah
you see how it feels ah
like getting injections over and over again
okay lah I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast ah
like really rapid
uh huh
uh huh
was that on impulse also or what
uh huh
uh huh
that your sisters what
oh ya ya
uh huh
uh huh
oh
okay lah so anyway it's kind of like fated ah that you
weren't supposed to get that tattoo ah

not like the hit up other girls kind of satan ah
mm
uh huh
dude you remember or you don't remember
okay lah I guess it turn out for the better lah huh
well I just I just finished my reservist today also ah
never sia
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes ah more like it
ah
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half lah the other half was
but ya other than that
err what time ah
like
uh ya
ya
orh
ah
sia
oh then my medical call
not bad ah
quite interesting ah
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill lah yes ah okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
err are you the one who called just now then the guy was like ah ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he oh his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is uh pretty rare ah to to to see like shocks getting given by the ah
ya but the guy
uh huh
oh
orh but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping ah
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
oh
compulsory to what
oh serious ah
ah
uh huh
okay lah I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay lah that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home ah he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
uh huh
ah
ah
so from from no breathing no pulse ah
oh ya that guy
uh huh
uh huh
confirm gone ah is it
uh huh
got the what again
ah the the one and two and three and four and that kind ah
ah
wait that was a doctor ah
it isn't you know
sian sia
who gets to do as in nobody want to do oh nobody wanna do
why sia
uh
huh
but uh
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also lah so he was saying that
cause
orh
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is lah but like
no point
oh
so can what
huh
ah ya ya the ugly one lah
oh
ya ya
oh ya I ding was telling us lah
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the lah recall
ah
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
oh
mm mm
okay ah
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay lah fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress lah cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no lah but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya lah definitely sia
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge lah but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the ah take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense ah
ya
and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
oh
uh huh
eight people
wah
oh
but wonder how often it's actually being used lah in
ah
ah
eh my friend from paya lebar also the madam told them don't turn out sia
they said they want to minimise
ah they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
ah fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I suay ah my
ya sia
don't know ah apparently it's the first time ah that
only the
they said because of the or something ah
but I don't know ah not really buying it
okay ah bo pian ah just go ah
then they also all the all the people were like
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called double meaning ah
so like
ya lah so must just be extra alert
okay lah but as in bishan usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad lah at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay lah interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different sia
what didn't you download the app
ah
uh huh
I think for you all different lah cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay ah
download what
oh no lah I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
oh the card ah
oh for a as a reservist ah
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
uh huh
uh huh
what did I what did I teach you
oh
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
uh huh
oh I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected ah
oh ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know ah
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
uh huh
uh huh
that one they are not choking already ah
huh
ha
in case anything happen like just cover your back ah is it
orh
oh so she wanted to go to the hospital ah
huh
something lah you feel like you are contributing it ya
oh
ha
huh
so you were already were were you there on the scene already ah for this
that was that was was that you
orh wasn't you ah ah
wah yesterday they were telling me like
err ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
ya ya that one that one
then
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
that you can close
ah so like
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
then he like
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
then which doesn't make sense because
but he climbed downstairs
then door open then he like he told them ah what he saw
then the two people outside like eh
but we didn't even close the door sia we just like we just held it ajar
ya that's the
as my my my call
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
ya
then what you doing tomorrow
ah
uh huh
oh so you buying for yourself lah
orh
ah
oh
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen kan
then I I was having headaches like every week
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
oh shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
err
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo

right
yup
how old is your daughter now
oh my god you see
you see
it's ah it's he's a it's
he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that I've not seen you
and the the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
yes we just performed our buttocks off ya and you remembered in her house there was like there's there's like
a mini stage where she you know it was in like her I don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
ya lots of memories there but very err blur
vague
cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's err
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me lah
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
in front of people
and then after that the
so
ya ya you were you were it
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay lah the word is forget ladies and gentlemen um
manufacturing
right no no no continue no no no ya
this was another traumatising part err on my end
I guess so ya I guess so
oh ya ah we were kids we were
just stop lah like whoa
ya but you know
right
hmm oh my god
forced that's the word
you know what I felt the same way about you
and
what
oh my god I remembered
right
right mmhmm
mmhmm
we ya
I remembered
then we were doing oh and you know ya that was
we were very very happy
right
oh ya
but
yes I remember that part also and another thing which I also remember was that err
brother john
no
love
brother brother love
mmhmm
ya eh same ah
right
okay
you
I mean you are very positive
what
right right right right right I I feel that I feel that you are trying not to raise up that that that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya I err
yes err I mean my mum is quite
fat and I love her and my dad loves her very much you know err ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time
mmhmm okay err I remembered when we we went to primary school together right we went to xishan primary school together which is in yishun
bye
right
you know that kind of thing so
oh no
ya
see how lucky you are and you are living in err your your place right is located whereby it's
warning sign ah
the connection still
so yup
and
your father because I think we did have this conversation
err at one point of time
oh ya ya ya my dad also lah my dad also speaks english
like around my dad's age ah
as in to to do his exercises right
and he will do the the simple exercises with the stretches no I I did introduce him to yoga but I I don't think he's interested in that
ya he starts to like cycle so
like I'm actually happy for him you know because
I guess I mean
ya so um um he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years lah
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
ya
ya
not say active lah like I am not interested in the whole thing I I I don't know maybe because I'm like you know I like it's weird because okay
I don't get my information from there I go to the news I direct news and all this
so I don't and as as you know I'm quite introvert also
am I ya I think so ya I'm quite introvert ya so ya because ya I I rather you know
I rather be alone
and I'm not lonely wow
no no no
ya I mean but

ya I ya you know what I definitely one hundred percent
you know and you are always smiling you always happy and I don't understand that about you sometimes
stupid and evil
at times
malaysians really why be careful ah oh what are you trying to say lah can you please be more hmm
err told my grandma
no worries
oh yes the policeman
so they got married they set up a house he became a policeman blah blah blah then after that he had I think like nine children
you know because at that point of time during the olden days they liked to have so many children I don't know why you know there was no control so my mum was apparently I think she's like number five or something ya
she's like the one of the middle child
okay
rewind
grand aunty ah yes

that's why
mm
mm
exactly
mm mm
mm mm
ya
that's why very scary ya
mm mm
mm mm
mm
ya it's not as developed as like as ours that's why lor
mm
mm
true
ya
ya
mm I mean
mm
mm
mm
is it
oh my god
oh my gosh
mm
damn
mm
like
mm
fair enough fair enough
mm mm
uh uh
mm mm
uh uh
ya
mm mm
mm mm
mm
oh
oh no no no
uh uh seh
you were there in the bus itself
oh my god
oh my god I think you need to block your mask with your hand man
double protection this one
orh
oh my gosh
not directly beside me but like you know got the cross cross on the chair then after that then at the end got like sit
uh uh uh
this aunty was sitting at the other end tau which was okay because it was like sit cross cross sit
uh so she sat at the other seat
ya and they know talking I mean they weren't very close together also so they were quite social distance also
ya and then after this security guard came because he was like uh hi sorry what are you doing here then after oh ya ya we we just um waiting for the bus or like I don't know what they said to the security guard
then the security guard he said oh sorry this one more than five people cannot because I the number of aunty sit standing
then
then
sorry how about you what are you doing here then I'm like oh I'm waiting for someone
and after I was like oh you cannot stay here for too long then I'm like
I I like this
uh
mm ya I agree lah like
mm mm
it prevents ah
mm
mm mm
mm mm
I think so lah I think
because january already had COVID what it's COVID nineteen means twenty nineteen seh
mm
mm mm
yes yes
ya is because
I also think that is good that like now they're clean the things are good
mm
mm
ya
ya
um ya I actually do that right then after that all the aunty
is it
mm
mm
mm like my manager she stays in ukraine right
but for her it's like oh for us the measures are getting tighter
ya cause she said the situation is not getting better so they have to do something about it
mm
mm
mm mm
and they don't have like
police giving like three hundred dollar fine every and stuff
mmhmm
mm mm
mm
like I was gonna say you want to go to travel this is called travelling to heaven
you die already ya go to heaven this one
mmhmm
the toilet lah everything right you have to
mm
true true true
orh
mm
mm
mmhmm
actually kan for the safety of everyone eh actually I got twelve people in the same group you know
mm mm
mm
really orh hor
mm
that time you not so careful anymore to be honest lah like let's be real eh
mm
a'ah
mmhmm
mm
I don't think that's going to work in fact
mm
mmhmm
ya
good luck to you eh
uh uh I'm like
at this point I don't know whether he's trying to make it funny ah
if I can if I can make you smile by making this funny why not
ya that little spark of happiness you know

so basically um
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and err so err
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything lah about his life so
true enough lah he is a very uh forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an uh up point for him lah you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
changi airport
um
and that changi airport is what we thought it was lah to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it lah
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then um so now he is uh working at uh novena and he is there because uh he wants to do office work and rightfully so lah because he wants to uh spend more time lah with your family
uh and
since he has going to move towards
getting married uh he thought this the right step ah as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound lah in why he's doing it okay then he talk about um
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay ah this one ah oh every time I do as in ah like
was it so difficult to ah get this out
the mirror the mirror side
ah middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so ah what else um okay so I I
ah okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
ah that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
ah
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact uh do you have connect plan that's he look at me like uh what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years oh we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said lah ya ah six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and ah okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya lah but I don't know why they want that place lah anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
ah he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so um ya so that that part they understood lah you know what it's it's spilt milk ready lah kan like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why lah
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk zina whenever zina butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then err
ah revise plan ah ah correct
ah I also don't want to embarrass lah zina cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing zina session but no point lah the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for zina to actually ah secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows lah that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working lah and you zena needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience zena hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for zina to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children ah then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
ah that one okay lah they bring about the halal thing lah so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya zina needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
ashraf you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
ah come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
ah then they say
okay for me I uh I feel that
so it's like if he lah in the sense that ah so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told zina and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course lah
mmhmm
anyway I
so mm ya then I told him okay ashraf after all that's been said ah I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya lah I said you have
mm
then
um so basically that's it lah and then
at least it's it's clear lah that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
no he will just use
mm like
mm ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage lah
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at changi
ya so it's was very easy lah then after when he left also I was telling lah see how easy and simple ashraf
was
by just being upfront
no zina you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya lah so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my ah that's why it was very simple lah because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that lah kan
so and he also can recognize lah the value in it and can recognise why you know zina needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that zina needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time zina would be the one taking care of it
ashraf ah because uh
someone needs to be there at home lah he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or zina's parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working lah and then I then I ask him so uh are you exploring the possibility of zina working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
um
okay lor then after then the
in the dining
uh
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear lah clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
um
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
huh
zina is receiving dayah is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working ah ah
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
dayah at is at this stage of her life
mm
mm so we don't know that lah huh
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so oh anyway going back to zina I I told zina like
you need to sit down and you really need to uh
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough lah if he uh considered um
cause he then I say uh I
uh
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how ashraf is
I told her lah did you see or not what ashraf did
ya
that's why lah she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as oh
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
zina that is not easy-going
mm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going what
you are not um having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
mm
that's why during the
that's why ashraf
if
the way
ya lah of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent lah
I don't think he would lah if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
err
push zina right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
mm
so ya basically concludes the whole thing lah with
zina and ashraf then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya dayah and me then ya I understand that you and dayah are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what hidayah is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
ah
huh
you lah ah then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and izat I bet you ah you and dayah would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least ah you see ah it me and izat
I'm doubting you know whether you and dayah would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why lah that's why it seems it's
ya lah
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps lah
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay lah I think
I can tell that me and izat even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
uh huh
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya lah so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama wah at one okay at one point
mm
nevermind just mm
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like um there was one point where um
then I said zina since when you are that close to izat then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to izat then I say rubbish lah
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya zina you are close to izat because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to izat
izat is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct ah but I say you are close to the boys just because of uh
uh you are close to izat just because the boys uh with izat you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to izat
then I say since when you been talking to izat since when
all all the
you are that close to izat then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys kan
further studies
ah then I then I also
need this person the person ah to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what izat can do this job ah
ah then izat do you think then she's like smile ah aiya lah cannot lah
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
mm that's why
hmm
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward one really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course

I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days ah like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and err the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so given that nowadays phones they uh they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me ah I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about oh no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about johor do you remember going to johor
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old johor house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old johor house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
mmhmm now the closest to johor we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there ah
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at uh pulau ubin what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so um what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
mmhmm
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to bugis like literally a five minute walk to bugis if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to bintan
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said oh we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like ah we're choosing to go to hong-kong oh why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya oh what time you know
it's a colleague so ya
okay we should uh and our session ya it was nice talking to you poor
okay bye

well if I have
three wishes kan
um the firstly lah I
I would like to become a millionaire
oh ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just um
okay how many options just ah one or two or three
not that good
meal eh
oh overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique lah
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best eh
to that extreme yes
ah
no the wagyu beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
itaewon the itaewon actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain ah it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up err that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the bulgogi is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the bulgogi
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal lah I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is lah
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and wah I tell you the
okay in japan kan in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of lah
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive lah but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school lah cause err frankly speaking in asia right
really far kan
ah so that is the gist lah actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept err alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting kan that's what I when if you go around the world then you see lah
mm
correct correct correct is like that one
uh so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
ah so that is the gist lah
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy ah but again lah like
into youtube kan
ah yes cause garlic is very good lah basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy eh I
healthy
fruits lah I eat fruits lah but uh if you want it
okay ah usually fruits lah I just eat fruits
oh almost everyday is egg lah by right egg is is considered healthy food mah
skills eh meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code lah code very very well so that I can build
err games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product ah after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
uh one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause uh again ah
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again uh it's all about the skill set ah if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food ah
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep lah and also very err
they have very rich history uh their okinawan
karate-do aikido
if you're late for one minute eh they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right okinawa the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
kata it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
ah that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use uh a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really ah do research on it
sorry again
was free
err
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this err
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view lah but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
oh
oh
okay ah
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
mm
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
ah cause I think that is the way to go lah you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity eh
meaning what ah
hmm ah eight hours eh
activity eh activity
activity
eight hours eh
wah
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight eh I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke lah if a comical joke easy ah double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause err my life how to say ah
it's a pretty boring lah
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya lah
actor eh err
okay ah actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
um he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one ah also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like err
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this ah
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed uh then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
ah orh even beyond that um you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that eh
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male ah character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this ah characters also this achilles
uh his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya lah and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used um can really
make if you really into this ah like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful lah I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
oh how I keep ah I don't know leh
actually I just went through life ah
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that um
after I read a book for half an hour
all these uh youtube lah especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it lah
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read one
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos lah I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right err I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something ah err you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist ah
seventeen years old eh
seventeen years
old self
ah
seventeen
need to know ah you need to give me a time period
seventeen
oh poly eh
err
advice
I don't truthfully ah I don't regret anything
advice eh okay the best thing is
ah
ah actually frankly speaking eh at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago ah and actually
ah if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine ah
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
err
things in life yet
your character back then when you
uh
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life lah
just a live my life that's all lah mm
where do I see myself eh
in five years' time eh okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same ah as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married lah so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially uh
money making invention business so basically is
the coding lah hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it wah then I'll be woo
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years

yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing lah you yes err so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back

mm
yes
correct correct correct
yes
yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya
understand understand
ah
ya
yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective uh a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think uh it's quite it's it's something that uh there I I would I would um and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn lah
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
oh right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
oh definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
ah no no it was a academic uh more of a academic kind of uh mistake lah uh I mean it was a academic um how to say ah misstep which which I could have my my my um my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science ah which means then after that err the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was uh just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six ah I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit ah when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis ah so I had to remove my appendix because err it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had err not err what err gone to the hospital lah uh if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication uh in which this this uh operation actually made my stomach lining weak
uh because they have to cut they have to cut through mah so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my err my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another lah basically so it was first it was an appendix then uh it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical eh in a medical sector your intestines uh usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
uh apparently that can be fixed okay err and and basically what happens is uh if you fix it uh generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this uh this condition but um the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and uh hopefully hopefully lah ah cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again lah
huh this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was uh in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is err err specifically flying related
so uh they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day uh but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying lah
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that ah oh debt uh I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them uh ah no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate uh site I was actually doing uh business business aircraft when I was in the
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened err this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad err I mean it was just a very bad timing ah it was the worst hit industry ever uh unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and uh they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old lah so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again ah
to the parts ah they get uh they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
uh some of them they do but most of them for the most part err they don't need right they just they juts leave them there lah they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there ah nobody wants to uh you know ah then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this lah you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be lah
oh man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of uh of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot lah this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was uh it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay lah so I thought it was uh it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did lah and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
but but for now uh I got the next best thing which is uh flying drones lah
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers eh
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen ah but if that ever happens ah you will know why ah you know all about the history behind it lah you can tell people oh yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya lah yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know oh my goodness

mmhmm
ah ah
bishan lah
ah
ah
okay
are you suffering from any uh no of course everybody will know
can I put no
have you ever been no
ah ah
cut
ah ah lah

K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one lah
so I think you can start first ah
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
ah kinaesthetic
ah kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility ah
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective lah
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
oh so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
mm ah
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot lah what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing err port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish err irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
robert pattinson
ya that one
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers ah wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
ah if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
ah specifically to children ah because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard ah
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for ah
adults ah
um but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya lah but
teleportation ah
but it saves time it's very quick
mm
ya ah but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please lah don't cut me off lah the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this lah but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it lah ah
ya okay
so that's teleportation
err
um if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything ah
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
ah your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K ah teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son aydin
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
wah you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
mm
mm
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited ah okay
orh
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective eh
work hard themselves
okay
mm
okay
err but I okay lah maybe for you kan
K
but I oh something came across my mind lah
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
mm
showing
the other side of ya
mm
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
mm
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome lah
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine

wouldn't that be interesting
ah
ah the bull's eye of medicine ah ah
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
but also
subsidised
subsidised
then that one you have to talk to the experts ah
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
ah not everyone
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
okay so
eh so that's about superpower lah
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
ah
or because I can
that is just lah

but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone

no the thing is the details
if I want to know
I will read about it
ya or I will go back
like you know I have a lot of things to do

ah
mm
okay
and
huh no
as in like
this is like life's basic
ya lah
ah
ya
superheroes everyone is a superhero in their own way

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap eh
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like huh
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
it depends ah maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
mee goreng but you know me and mee goreng
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that mee goreng taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not lah
which I don't think it is
this is actually konjac jelly konjac you know C O N J A C
ah have you tried mala before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of mala cause actually I I went to hai di lao we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to hai di lao and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all lah
uh because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try mala they so bad you know like you have to try mala I was like what this this this big deal about mala sia everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too kaw
you know kaw
yes
like too strong like that
uh
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil lah
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you ah
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K nah
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya err okay K ya ya uh it so it's konjac jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this mala taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious eh
you think the conversation is good
like
mm
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets ah the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
uh uh
you can just throw it away
because
stingy ah
mm
mmhmm
um
ah okay okay so
was it yesterday that I was working
so the day before yesterday
bump into this one man ah he we were walking
or like whatever lah I I don't think that was like the specific
and then
um he give you his card
and that card is a black card
okay is it his link card is black colour so no no no no no
credit card
like he bump into you so you ask for for compensation I think and then what will you do with the money
so what would you do with the money
if you were to have ah
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
babe
license doesn't
equal to one hour
mmhmm
mm
mm
okay now I
nevermind
oh I was thinking
because I want to get rich
so I was thinking I got the black card then I'm like I'm going to buy
the whole of ion building including residences
like each and every one of the residences and the whole ion
shopping centre itself
mmhmm everything
and then done ah for one hour I just like
just buy the whole building
cause from there you can circulate your money what so you can collect rent from like
cause this whole building is mine what
I can just like okay you all can fuck off
and this is the prime area oh
you all can F oh no no no no no you all can leave
and then I'll just like ya
eh you you see
see so clean
is it still stinging
like you are sleeping then you burp like oh my god I don't know why but lately
yes as ya it's super bad
I don't why it's getting worse now eh
I think it's cause I'm getting fatter
mm
ya that's why you can just buy one building only what
and then the money will rill on from there it's not cheap hello
rental can cost up like like thousands of dollars
and then from there then I can like what
I just be like one time buy the whole building ah
then I can buy off other stuff already what like from the money that I get from there
I buy another building or whatever lah from the money I can get then I can like what buy car

do you want me to spoil for you
do you want it you're asking for it you dying for it
get off my back ya
uh actually
the series makes the thing much more alive
ya I think every idea
from now onwards like if you make it into a book it's fantastic it's good the idea is there the layout the foundation is there
but then to make it live that's like better
it is of of course it's like believable lah ya the whole fantasy is believable
because it's like you can see yes exactly it's a very visual
but it's a lot of work actually
ya he's just playing it out
he's the original zigzagoon
he's the original raccoon that's why the sister like that
mmhmm
ya like a bunch of people right like gossip girl is everyone
but that's what happened in the end what oh

love island
err
there is this show about
I just watch actually the other day um
the other lady
mm
they adopt adopt children
did you watch that
no you have to watch it I think
it's like too fast
but towards the ends ah very very actually very sweet
I don't know why I force myself to watch that
I'm like literally sitting down waiting to go to work then in the end I went to work late plus I was watching this
I don't know
oh eh when is your exams ah
mm how is school
what do you mean by normal
eh speaking of which
actually I have school sorry if I'm like cutting you off
I know I'm like a tricksy
I'm just going to take you out ah
K I have a diploma in mass comm
degree in business marketing
in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe lah but like now lately with all the mental stress
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know lah I was just thinking a lot about it ah I don't uh it's been about two months already
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
um
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way ah
because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like eh a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
mm everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus
sus suspicions
what do you think what should I
err ya
ya have to really think about it ya cause you invest in time as well
mm
ya no no because the thing is because of this whole economic downturn
K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
I thought of like changing
changing the career line lah
changing the career and instead of
this whole cause the whole of uh the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it lah
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm of course ah but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also lah
mmhmm
no like just diploma first
of course
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
because if you are talking about money yes I'm I have the job base
it's paying okay
just okay
and plus I can always pay pay installment yes malay people like installment
this is going to be
but no no uh of course obviously it's like school fees you pay installment what so
not that I don't want to move back with you guys but I'm so comfortable staying alone
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes on top of that you have add the the fact that you have to spare your time
yes I get that what the hell is this
wet tissue face mask
ah listen you are already what
nineteen bitch
I said bitch
why
won't it be exciting
treat it as a hobby lah instead
can
ya I know I know yes I like to be driven as well I don't like to drive people but the whole idea of like getting a license is like interesting
which will have to carry on
to the next topic
which I think would be fantastic
holidays

mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya okay that one is a bit too touchy already but anyways
if given a choice
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
no because I've
I have travel all across europe not all across lah like maybe the western eh no eastern side of europe I remember it cheaper
like above
what was that the
the know not not not not not I won't said poor lah but that ya ya the eastern side of europe we should have a poor countries of europe everything there is cheaper right above france
ya not in france itself but ya the it is uh ya eastern side of europe
things are cheaper there
cause I was speaking to someone just now and then he was like
ya it's cheaper there but I haven't been there so I took the euro rail
ish ya
ya
mmhmm after conversion ah
so you like you hop on hop off like anytime you want that kind of thing
so I went from all the way from
a train ride all the way down to sicily france everywhere ah basically almost everywhere
mmhmm
mmhmm

that's I envy her lah
I love her whole approach to life
exactly exactly which we can't I mean
it's ya
yes
inshallah
exactly like I read that post on the instagram they were like the grass isn't always greener on the other side
the grass is always green when you water it
I was actually thinking about doing uh restart no
gardening oh no speaking of hobby K nevermind

um I started playing stocks again
I thought of
I I followed this one guy he is american
so um muslim
but very americanized ah so is I don't know whether is how halal is it ah which is apparently is uh
everyone muslim is following him ah
so everyone muslim is doing the stock then I was like eh this whole stock is not really halal you know
but anyway so I'm just going to see how it goes
ah ya speaking of which um hobby yes
sewing I thought of getting a sewing machine
like soon
I actually plan to go down to gain or like gain city or challenger
I want to start stitching my own clothes
ya
ya lah this deconstruct lah like you exactly like that shirt
so maybe I can have like I this deconstruct one shirt
then I take tear off all the seams and then just cut off a pattern
you know pattern you can just uh oh paper pattern

mmhmm mmhmm
wait you have to use tools
like hitting tools
plier
uh huh uh huh
eh you know what I can incorporate you know why cause I was actually thinking of you know
um okay I saw that fashion show where they were doing like
those headpieces
with those beads pearls laces
I was actually thinking of incorporating that
into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
uh ya very lame and cheap and always the same design
I thought of creating something that is like stand out
yes with beads lace
and then maybe can incorporate your methodology
or like earring whatever not not really earring lah but like maybe like some
metal pieces that you can stick you saw raja
the one the mouthpiece that raja wore the
that cover the whole face but leave out the eyes like catwoman like that kan cool kan
uh ya I thought of doing that
shall we
okay yes you and your exams when's your exam ending

no I was thinking about greens no no nope no no no no no
it doesn't it doesn't make sense to fight a lot
or like you can ride it like a horse

I was like ya allah ya rabbi
I know but I was like brother
I know that I am yes I am sassy
but
the patience is really wearing thin
I think it's because of the numbers ah
how
mmhmm
ya
any hotel lah with a good bathtub
a really good bathtub
no lah not okay ya now I'm thinking of it I should actually just go to a spa right
no ya actually thinking of it ya actually should just take the spa
ya I want to ya as much as I want to be pampered but I don't like
I was like screaming ah ah ah ah then he was like oi I haven't even touch you yet
ya exactly
you know what I think it's because
I think it's because of
childhood
over the smallest thing is it feels like torture right
ee
serious serious serious serious
then you know how my size is so big that everyone thinks that I'm cuddly
like oh I want to hug I say you better get away I will smack you then you know
no I just want to get in a bathtub that's all
okay I have a pool upstairs
I swim at night but the thing it feels different if you
have
I just want to soak

want to be appreciated I just want to be appreciated
ya I just want ya I just want to soak that's all like swimming pool yes I do swim alone at night at night alone so it's different ah
alhamdulillah it's like so rude
no irregardless I just want to like
mmhmm
actually you know what that time when I went to new york for new year's
new year's new york
this year how it really change eh
mm
ya next year should
come my friend is sell trying to sell me something
some E commerce thing
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk ah but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location ah in the end we loved it ah
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop ah
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like um sya was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like eh the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like oh shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like huh
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
mm
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet eh seriously I need to change this carpet
mmhmm
see
alhamdulillah
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did what
exactly a long time ago what
yes samled
mister samled
he passed away he's a good boy
codeswitching
like towards the end I never expected eh
ya
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
he's been forever kan
since you were like four or five
ya four or five ah
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain orh
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
mmhmm
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
mmhmm
uh huh
shouldn't be that expensive what to entice people to buy what or like rent
downgrade
decrease
mmhmm
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small lah
a false wall
then like I'm like huh
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this ah
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like oh I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like ah okay no way
but it's costly lah
it's nice sia it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all kan with the window
oh ya speaking of which just now I pass by uh river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like oh my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
huh I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
ah that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
potong pasir
no
potong pasir yes
potong pasir I love the room because it was an upgrade
they clean once in a while it was nice
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
hmm
huh when
she cook curry
mm
huh then where was I
oh interesting
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this uh this time round lah but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like uh
eh no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
mm
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

the err primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also err too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't ah I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay lah actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays lah
no I want my holidays during off peak period
mm
kindergarten
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours one also
ya
yes last resort mm
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment kan so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing lah but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
mm
oh maybe I just don't handle stress well
ah like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second one so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that one I you know lah
they have been trained
ya amazing

clap ah
okay start
is our first time sia I quite nervous I'm so nervous
okay okay I think your phone needs to be nearer ya okay err just now we had our chinese lesson
so um like coffee bean was so packed ya so but no choice lah we really tried to find a place kan ya but I was also very sleepy ya so what do you do in the err sungei buloh
how many friends did you go with
is it the the malaysian guy that you told me about before
oh
then you all didn't decide to grab lunch or something
oh
oh what did you buy
he was he was singing then I was like wah in my heart eh is like like bursting tau ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time err he was a bit down and like err demotivated kan
so when I like I heard him singing then wah like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like oh my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week ah ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also
your face ya so ya lah so they were encouraging him to sing more lah cause they were happy that he's happy then err he even he was like err cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is rex he's a filipino guy
so he was like rex I'm going to dedicate this song to you and like all the nurses in this ward for taking care of me and then he was singing the all of me song ya ya john legend I cannot remember ah all these names ya so ya lah so they were they were like some of them were singing with him also like while they were doing um I think doing his blood test and all that
ya so like I think I think as a nurse also if I were if I were the nurse also I'll be super happy like this patient like in a way found their motivation
ya
okay I'm done
err what did I have for lunch ah oh ya because I was talking to haziq until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one eh eh no ya around one eh no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
mm true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars nasi lemak at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like err but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then err the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
oh ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about um just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya choa chu kang
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't oh okay I remember I went to oh cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like um it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this one is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it lah so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in choa chu kang doesn't have a shower
later like what time
err the burger err I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what ah I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella eh no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom eh the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya don't know ah it's just like I I like it that way ah
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in
oh
where
mm
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
oh okay okay okay
oh
oh okay wait what is this cafe called again
is it is it like the
but is it like in a mall or is it like in the middle of nowhere
oh wow that's interesting um so why did you guys want to go there
mm oh ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
oh and that's enough for him
mm
mm oh ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear
mm
then after that you all didn't go for dessert or anything
I think so ya oh I didn't know there was a drive through there
you and your mocha
mm mcdonald's drinks are always sweet
mm that's nice so so he pick you up from
aww that's nice
ya yesterday I just went to the hospital oh like after I gym then I went home to shower then after that I was feeling pretty lazy lah honestly so I just err ask my brother ah eh can I take the car or not then he say can go and take ya then I took the car I drive to I drove to
so I was super scared about that so like err when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there lah to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe kan I just parked right smack in front of the lift
nasi ah sorry I ate the lor mai kai then I ate the then I order three siew mai
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that lor mai kai got the like the wok hey taste ya oh my god ya so that's why like wah I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the lor mai kai
I didn't see anything at the ulu car park ah parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital kan ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
eh
I hope that we can play badminton later seh
ya
ya too windy I think too much but I think
so that err they all evaporate faster something like that lah I have no idea how the science works ah ya okay let me see what are the prompts um
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
damn what who who is that celebrity
oh
ya that's true
that is a very is hyorin right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
mm
oh damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how oh chey
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy oh
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor kan but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
mm wow that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay um do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
mm stereotypes ah
ya I get what you mean ah ya is a bit err a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that one it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is oh you malay ah you in uni ah oh so you are one of the what ah a smart malay ah they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before lah but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya lah I know I know recently also like especially during um the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so err aiya don't know lah I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like oh okay okay okay but ya like like quite sian ah to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that err everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say lah
he's on what on the ship oh
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for um youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths ah
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up lah because err even though to me lah like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe lah inshallah like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did ah I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to err and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like I I don't know ah like I just cannot cannot handle it lah ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like oh don't worry lah I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is lah ya cause err one of the mentors was telling me that like err he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
oh damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
ah ah okay let's look for one more question mm
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free eh
that's true but technically also isn't it like
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing what right ya
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that um analogy lah ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more lah ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that lah
ya oh my god my throat
hey oh ya okay then for me what was the question again ah
um my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free eh food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer um if something was free ah can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya lah like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya wah it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored leh if I were immortal
no oh my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy ah okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just um and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them lah basically
aesthetics ya sia okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift hmm will the werewolf be the shape shifting one maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to um the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then um I don't know would you rather be like

okay
okay for the next one hour lah
okay
so
okay
so sharizal long time lah I never meet up with him okay so so many things happened lah
then you know and then uh
mask
ah
that's what I thought also but then again um not gold bar that's what I thought also it's mask mask mask COVID nineteen ya
ya so he has a store
to sell mask
err
before that he was err after
then after that they do safety for the week
ya so ya lor so that's pretty much he he does lah
totally ya we talk and talk and talk and talk and talk
then um
we
so ya lah we were there
ya we went there then after that
eh alamak closed closed then we went to err the
it's
ya ya ya ya there's one standalone stall
I don't know man I just there like okay lah
err
ya put aside lah it was
ya ya
ya wasn't so enjoyable because I was like ah shit you know so much so that
so same P one

err maybe one day we can ask him over lah
to our daughter
pass away who pass away
that was like many many many years ago right
ya err family eh
ya
so
ya lah
punggol punggol
I don't know like how many like
you know quota something like that lah but apparently
he
I'm not so sure I think what I I have a feeling probably it's an english school or what lah I never I heard lah I forget to ask what's the
the name of the school
ya
uh huh
yup
oh
okay wait for the place okay
okay okay okay I just now this err today lunch I ate at jurong point do you know that jurong point there is like a japanese kind of like halal place do you know
ya ya ya no no no no it was at err along this err
the swensen's all that lah that was that
I don't know
probably I think so ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
we we finished already we finished eating so we just pass by there
err
ya he just she's not into that kind of food lah I I think so lah
eh three daughters
like the the eldest one is like what twenty three twenty four like that
so ya lah
that's that
tomorrow err tomorrow tomorrow
uh
oh then after that the ya
then no after that no more already lah right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how aiya ilan madrasah
slippers you mean
mm
mm ya
oh okay
ah okay lah
okay
oo ya
oh
ya talking about her ah
oo that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story ah because err
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing lah but the timing is also like err odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish ah
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early lah but sometimes
ah they go off or sometimes
when you work late ah you have to finish late lah you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back ah
not that bad ah
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back lah right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off ah something like that or
something like that lah alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is err I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish ah
err I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know lah and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early lah to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she oh then this one ah I will ask sani to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear ah kan
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out ah then after that she like go out ah then she like alamak aiya I like I also don't want ah to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything lah kan
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this one because they are like contract ah
ya contract not staff
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this lah you put in extra hours lah you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing lah it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like err worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
ah ya
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit ah and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you ah hani ah hani can and
ah ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like err
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
mm mm mm
yup maybe we should go there
art ground also ya
oh then you better check lah
mm hmm
eh
mm is it
ya ya ya ya
who who who just said ah I remember one of the maid does that
where is it ya
yulis do that can't remember lah that maid do that
so anyhow ya
oh I don't know no no ya okay wait
uh ya ya ya
kan

I don't know lah seriously
group ah
like you call yourself like oh what from the ex black hole
if if I'm black hole I will sue them man
oh is it but I just I just find it weird lah
because it's it's like my brands lah
okay you you want to advertise ya I I I think I have to be upfront about it lah
like you don't use my brand ah
like say eh I'm from err Adidas like that one Nike you know
ex Adidas err it just logo right basis like shoes right
ya but but I think it's just because our context like singapore is too small I say it's like ah
I say like I'm I'm ex you know
I don't know I just I think like he
I just feel it like it
come from like you you leave me and you you open up the same thing as me you get what I mean not
so it's like I I leave
my
agency and I set up another agency but I still leverage on err that agency's name I think it's just
if you open up something else probably lah but I don't know
ya but you took to advertise I don't know
advertisement ah like you know right it's ah
if I if you are like the owner how how do you feel
ya ya where were you from oh I used to work here okay lah
it feel like advertise herself as that is the header lah
I'm from like ex ah
okay
I I think it's it's maybe not right lah
ya
ya so so many things err
ya
okay
okay
okay
oh
ya

this one this shoes also quite new ah I don't know whether want to sell whether want to
then you sell and buy another shoes the one that the friend gave you know

ya according to him lah I don't know
ya
oh that day got one somebody enquire about the
the japanese shoes you say you want twenty bucks then I say thirty bucks
then I say like thirty bucks lah you want I say oh I need to try I say come lah you come and try lor

no because the thing is to be honest the shoe is quiet big for me ah
I think bought err like

end of the year or end of the month ah end of the year ah ya
I don't know man and never make any arrangement that is fifty over plus family already have like so far make arrangements to leave lah
that's like the singapore like plan private I don't know lah these people
thought ah I I I got no idea they are
because because
no but I I uh I I think they will give in notice like know three years ago something and then after that these people I don't know what they gonna do
like like those kind of movies then they stand there then bulldozer come I don't know
ya so
mm
I like the the the the the the
have some power nap in between but I don't know when
I don't know when because ilya come back I need to buy the sandal
ya then shortly after that need to like err
ya from that time until this
ya so really when can I sleep late ah
like you know whatever we talk just just stay there already lah like you know don't don't ask around
ya lah
um
what
so ya lah

okay can
hey you aunty
I'm doing okay
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter lah the what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
oh really ah so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only lah
oh so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
aww
could you feel like the maternity love already
ah like a responsibility ah
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know lah what is a sign
ah ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet lah
okay cool sis so anyway um
you know ah later I'm going to go err have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having ah is asking me ah all type of weird questions one
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person lah better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is um
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya lor
mm mm mm mm
oh
err but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
ah so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago ah what what would you probably be saying to yourself
oh ah
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me ah I think ah ten years ago I was sixteen right
oh
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met hakim or risahd which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing sia like if I didn't meet him right
activities are very lah so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with hakim also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring ahmad along so we go gig we go um
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met amin yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl ah
eh you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy lah okay
err are you still longboarding err probably all that lah probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit ah I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me ha is the
um
walao eh got so many questions you know they ask
oh ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay lah okay lah ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
what what other things would you be petty about
oh
a'ah ah
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys ah right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
oh ya lah ya lah
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
uh huh uh huh
walao eh why she like that one
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it huh you want to fight
me ah pettiest reason ah
err pettiest for reason for me to oh my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay lah petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like aiya like dislike a bit ah ah it's like our dearest lor
ah like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
if ah like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so ah sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but ah
ya that's true okay but then again it is lah correct lah it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a like common sense thing
but ya but then ya lah it becomes petty because ah whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him ah like ah no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate lah right just like annoyed
can
oh is it like what
oh ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone lah right
ah
mm
mm
ah ah oh oh oh
oh because you were julie
oh cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up lah
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya oh you mean she said hi to everyone except you
oh I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it lor
ya lah ya lah for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest lah this one is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's um
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past ah right it's just like
like some people like make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like oh is it okay lah then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
what I do sia I don't know I just come sia so it's like
and then it's just because of the nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why err ah like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class ah was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that err her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class one not
ya ya like and then like
ya then eventually I found out that eh you know ah she she say ah like she got say to me before
why why all these guys like me lah ah she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your err physics ya exactly
okay so far it's okay
eh but then ah she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the to bangkok I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because um she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend ah like you
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend lah like you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
wah I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
that such a person exist that can be so
so ya lah but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her lah I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her lah but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now lah it's just more of like
mind blown by it like walao eh like I could never sia go through that trouble for man ya lor
so ya petty things ah huh that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me one but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered one
alright okay this one is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mmhmm
oh mm mm
ya ya
oh my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot eh
a'ah ya lah ya lah
err can play a lot of things siol can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like uh so it's just a random skill like oh you so you can do that then you're like ya lor I can
oh that's great sia like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
and then I'm like die lah ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like oh she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
walao eh confirm can one lah it's just one line don't be petty lah we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking ah
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful ah skill
second skill um
so random ah but I would pick up sea sea diving eh
mm so fun sia
like in general I've uh I've always been intrigued by the sea
like that's why when shai like her videos ya tioman I always feel like wah best sia ah like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where oh it's very doable you just go tioman
ya but so far eh you know can touch the okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see kan everything so so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
if I could pick up
ya ya
a'ah a'ah ya
correct
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright sia then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent seh because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing lah
but then I won't be singer lah like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya lor
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions ah
ya lor ya lor
how do you think oo
ah
hmm
light effect
alright um wah if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya lor
I know right
okay this one is the actor is the very everybody will know one
oo
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to err exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya lah ya lah you skip that part lah
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
mm where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
alamak you kills
oo
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few booboos but then again kan he's young
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but then I'm like you all shut up lah you all young
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy sia
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
he is even more powerful sia season two
ya
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all you all not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom err from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing lah like he gives platform for like like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
he was sharing ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
ah he will share it ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married lah but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for err everyday
okay eh no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
I learnt about johnny depp's err wife not wife ah they never married ah vanessa paradis I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
he okay another person okay sorry this one is also this one is also actually quite epic ah if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version lah actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world lah she's like
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane ah even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also see what she does in a day ah like I think she's so inspiring sia like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to err explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her sia for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever lah
but whatever it is ya lah like cheating cannot be justified lah right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and uh angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
like she's a gemini so I was like sia lah a true gemini sia this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like sia that's like me but like back then lah when I was reckless lah so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt wow
ya oh my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your uh stray kids or like
what do you mean
ya because ya you have to be super disciplined
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya ya like ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman ah
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
oh maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
ya what is your capability what can you do ah can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
err I can't
err no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
no lah it's our opinion mah
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
okay lah obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five suria like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
oh my god imagine
it would be so epic sia
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like in singapore characters in general can be so
walao eh
ya lor ya lor actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
but then ya lah for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where ah
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how lah right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the lah so it's just purely in our imaginations ah
ah how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm correct
eh my god I can imagine sia my one is the zombie
then after that err getting comfortable
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
no eh but then ah you know the singapore and is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our our government will
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually lor
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month lah then the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually lah when but singapore will be the last lah to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy lor so we were all lose weight very drastically
oh okay obviously at each country oh ya because this one humans were extinct right no hope what so no choice lah everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
ya because of a pandemic seh
err
ya
mm ya lor
uh anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
oh my god eh wait wait wait but is activity eh
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like err maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
next okay next
ya
eat damn slow lah like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely lah like sia I imagine like running running for eight hours
everything what other thing maybe is the err
but that one is like quite therapeutic sia sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't lor I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
what other things that we do like everyday activities sia
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
uh uh
if you
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
walao eh
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya lor then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like ugh okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful one
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this one even more sia you cannot sleep in peace eh you sleeping there lah then like then got hi
then another one hi the patient will like uh shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating sia like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya lor who know you got the dark secret but ya lah I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing ah
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya ya ya
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya lah
but it's too dramatic ah
girl or boy
ya ya ya
how old is he again ah one year older eh or your age
oh
twenty six eh twenty eight
oh nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know uh it's the same uh the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
aunt allyson has eh is damn
ya eh it's damn strong sia babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya lah so that's why I said unless she use that power only
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse ah
I would love that power
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life ah so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault lah kan because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it what and she had to go through her downs for her to like oh shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again eh honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing what it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died seh for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish sia
oh and then he's said oh why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes wow
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
ya
ya
I feel like allison is compromising a lot sia she's so nice like nah
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine sia and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
oh my god
mm that's why
okay ah
oh my god you're so right
ya lor stay here forever lah
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house mah
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say ah it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
like okay at twenty one you are all
err entitled to a
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if err twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot lah seh
then will be like
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya lah I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay lah
alright uh
what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
oh right right right right okay eh I get to know you more lah seh babe from here

ya err
no thanks to david moyes we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back um bit our hand back
and you associated with all of them
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya ah the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about thiago he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in barcelona central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
I can't believe sia
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham a'ah
when did they ever not lost okay ah to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean ah but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
arteta
plus minus ah plus minus ah
he knows his a level above everybody else ah no but but K you know there's this two theories of
err two types of players football theory eh two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers kan
ah the likes of
guardiola
and pochettino and martinez and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis van gaal ah ajax school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis van gaal is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but err no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective ah okay err
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent ah
he does basically ah
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen ah in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis van gaal school of control
wait then then I have the flip side ah the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually merino takes everything that is strong about louis van gaal and finds the witnesses so like louis van gaal takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using merino flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing ah
bionic inter milan game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but inter milan won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is err
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's mourinho
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin ah
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick zambia lonso
err err schools that kind of control zavi iniesta chaos player
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so err he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why van gaal and cryuff although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
cryuff emphasise more on individual creativity van gaal is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what mourinho exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre ah mourinho he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
opposites outside of the spectrum for one klopp
he
klopp denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
ya ya ya swan

alright so on on the surface level eh on the surface level is like ah
desensitising us to sexualisation so
ten eleven years old kan
eleven years old not wearing ah so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids ah and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences eh
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing lah that's the justification ah so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world ah mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
it's not a sleazy casting call ah
mm mm
kevin spacey serious

pressurising you to look good in this way use this shade of colour that shade of colour and you are happily buying makeup and you're saying that you are in control of yourself and

Netflix binging I've I've cleared so many shows just by watching
four five episodes a night on a weekday and I just basically every weeknight I clear four or five episodes so I started off with
when we started listing
use of my time ya ya unfortunately ya
you watch again superb show lah then
correct
yes
what
better call saul correct
I think season two you still have not ah coming to six
he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself ah ah to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am kan uh we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
morally ambiguous ah but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging tau when you put yourself in and ask yourself
ah ah ah ah ah it's a psychological phenomenon ah it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation
okay a'ah a'ah
sheer willpower ah a'ah
mm ya
a'ah a'ah but
you should lah sial dude
have you watch prison break
a whole season or all four all four seasons
followed by the movie
no
what is his name will
he didn't die ya he declared himself gay but he
okay
what why why should that be to you you should be to woman okay but err there's four seasons of prison break followed by a movie
after you watch okay after you watch after you watch the movie then you follow season five
there's a season five and that's the final season
ah so it's a four seasons
movie then season five err
that one on the way their their in the works
okay season fourteen end up somewhere around two thousand twelve or thousand thirteen
ah then the movie then two thousand seventeen they came out with with
season five
a'ah
which is and is is coming soon
I started on watching this thing called peaky blinders
peaky blinders is short ah it's only four seasons of six episodes each very short
what iPhone is that doesn't look different from previous iPhone
okay
okay
safe entry
camera ah
I scan one
I keep the browser open
mmhmm
mmhmm
really
okay
mmhmm
which is which yours
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
ya
oh you go it goes in a clockwise
ah
mm
uh huh
uh huh
so where is
oo
ya ya ya ya ya ya
as long as
a'ah
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
why
one corner
wait
oh hawker centre
a'ah a'ah correct
mmhmm
so it's not the
a'ah ya lah ya lah ya lah

right
can
oh okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then um you can
choose
eh I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically err when you
what's that called where he lives is also err stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just um
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance lah ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
oh then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is ah amendment there is ah basically um when you choose err your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things ah
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to lina everything kan send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire um all the details so that err being a typical singaporean ah we kiasu one so err once err once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it oh okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller lah basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay ah
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that lah but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like err like they're they're very busy lah so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and alina
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different lah
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday ah you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you oh close the window
ya things like that lah but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
um
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot lah ya but for me it was I chose the eh no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
um ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different ah mm different ah
wah I don't remember whether there's any charges eh
okay okay
don't need one not necessary ah they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is um it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them err I I've got work lah they will they will still will pressure you then oh but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that oh it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end what ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch oh now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point kan
mm dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say err like
it it defeat to me lah it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it lah like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends lah ya so
all weddings there will be time time time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
kan then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing lah cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding eh eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location what how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully lah it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live err a chendol station ah everything like in the mosque everything lah quite quite nice lah he paid for everything
then ya lor then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is um itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me lah is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible lah in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me ah that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their eh they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way lah you know that they want to save your money and
different person different lor ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing ah they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
err I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at bedok reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to dewi
like for me I leave it to alina like for me I leave it to alina on how you want to to but the thing is like alina also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research mah
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like eh I cannot be splitting it right down the middle ah right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like eh our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like eh I want fifty dollar my problem lah
I pay myself what that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have err chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that lah ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
mm salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
um
mm
mm
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding err expo and everything kan so it's a bit different ah
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography ah ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing lah ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
mmhmm can do that also
err I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place lah if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled lah I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
mm can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us lah
ya it is quite nice also over there um on the wedding day itself lah ya
as in your wedding day lah I want to book the indigo room over there oh no need lah ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points oh no need lah no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel mm no need no need no need
um
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well lah I would say err okay so basically
you have to see
mm yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and alina did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
wah she the that that that girl is amazing ah ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins lor all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early kan ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues lah basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about err the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important lah
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that lah
okay
mmhmm I would say you don't need to worry about the activity ah people will just take picture with you lah
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing eh no one no one cares lah
my the recent one with my with my err sister in law's brother we did at err malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem lah
no need lah okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know oh but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's wah you got a lot money
to me lah personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me lah personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements what
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own lah um cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early lah cause it's it's not fast job mah
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like wow
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
err my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
mm but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know one when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very kiasu game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like alina throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be what then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes ah and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks lah the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important lor
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right um
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff lah I would say but I like him because err he listens to what I say
ah then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional lah he listens to me lah ya
yup ya so I just walk around ah I told him to follow me ya no lah I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked lina to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need ah ya

ya
err
the one I have here is the northern spain but we already I'm correct ya

mm
ya
ah ya ya
mm
it's already three
oh wells

ya so it says highlights spain and portugal this trip shows spain and portugal at their best the alhambra palace the hanging houses of cuenca the historic part of cadiz and vibrant cities like madrid valencia and lisbon
mm
mm

ya but I know she wanted ya she wants to go
lisbon lisbon
ah
never mind lah the husband ah you book another room ah so like iffah can alternate like between the our room and their room
eh
february
chinese new year
long leave ah
oh
this year was like late january right
mid correct
ya
ya my ex-colleague
no iffah is in february then the other two's in july then my cousin is getting married is getting married on ten of july then I was like
postpone it
oh
talking about it I don't whether can say it here but anyways
I mean I don't know but ya okay but never mind I just say lah I think it doesn't go anywhere but what's this
you were from griffiths right
then you should know
amalina
she was from griffiths primary
your age
why would a guy be named amalina
I don't know whether you will remember cause ya it's primary school so I'm not so sure
mm
ya so you don't remember lah
ya
ya so anyways ya the cousin
my cousin got married to this amalina lah ya
yes
ya
ya but after that she went to err ngee ann secondary ah
and then uh
mm ya
oh angsana yes
ya
zhong zheng or
why ah
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you grade lah
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
huh
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays ah
kiasu
mm
orh
orh
for for one year ah
one year
mm
how much is school bus eh
hmm
ya
mm
hmm
I think should be fine
I don't know lah should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
ah
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
oh yes I forgot that I got one good news today
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes ah
ya he's present he's rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the ya is him
ya not exactly okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
one one more year and then ya I'll leave lah
ya see how it goes
ya
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids lah also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say um
ya
ya
older kids ah I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers err
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
mm
orh
mm mm mm mm
approval lah
so who decides
the deployment
okay
you see the teachers but you don't see the
people like rarely right
oh so they do teach
wah
busy ah
like
mm
trust me I think you told me before ya ya ya
mm
mm
it's set auto eh
mm mm mm mm
you say it's uh
ya
ya
ya
oo
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's um
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
uh
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing lah just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then err depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is err cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya lah I mean basically you can climb lah
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
ya like my
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone ah
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya
how to say um
I don't know what I'm saying

where where's the tunnel
no they say that um what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
mm
huh
ah
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay lah probably
it's gonna be better
huh but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young lah
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest lah is like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
ah I was looking at this youtube um
the youtube is from america lah
yes
so it's like um
she
went to a nursery with
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear lah I don't know lah it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
there's a lot of different plants that um she feature lah
and then err the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent what no meh
no it's like
ah it's like a
um
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
ya it's like um apparently when the leaves are young
like
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though ah
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
ya it's quite tall
yes
mmhmm
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
cause I think it's like um you see
in a
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think um
um and there's no leeway lah
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
it like I think
it's not so healthy because
in their own way of keeping healthy lah so I think in that sense err that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
they actually force them to actually
mm
mm
ah
okay is okay lah but I think before
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation lah
mm mm
mm mm
err
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
mm
mm
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those um
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
um minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of err amenities for them to study which are like the laptop lah the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
girl in
ah ah
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her lah but for like elders other younger kids leh then how
ya
mm
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today lah I think there were also reports plus err like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
um
thought of
like
okay lah the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans what just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans what so it should be
um
encompass in all this care lah
but I think like
mm
mm
ya
ya even um
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
iphone ten
but more physically lah so
err that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
mm
no lah I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of lah I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
oh is it
oh
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on lah
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay lah I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
aiyo but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
hais
don't know what's gonna happen and
mm
I think
how can nature be a problem
that's
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay lor if you say so lor
ah
then there is a big issue lah
but I think like
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
but
ya lah but I still think lah confirm under black market so it's not that much lah
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything one
really what
mm
ya lah but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom what
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already what
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that what they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no lah I think
then animal go home lor
take the bus lor
no lah I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
buy one get one free
I think they kill it leh
ah
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also what and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
ah
you have seen it before what
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
should google it up the prayer plant
and err it's an indoor plant
err
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay lah
technically not really eh it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
um
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
ah ah
really meh I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it err refreshes the air ah NASA say one
really
ah
ah ah
true lah
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
huh
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
shoots ah shoots
oh
okay lah but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
okay wait ah
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
that is true hor
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong um so
what sort of plant got meh
coconut tree but it's not
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
oh my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
a bit different lah the milkshake
ya but anyway it's quite um it's quite a journey
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them um water the plant
like it they pouring into the side lah not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like wow like that ah
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk what
scotch tap hor it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
so I was quite amazed like oh okay you can actually do that
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care lah
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
no one lah not the standard issue plan lah and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
hmm
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat jinjja chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
err our christmas gathering lor exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill lah whatever lah
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
hais
what's the theme
more than thirty
oh I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny ah charlotte lah
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
err ya ah
doing comms ah
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay lah not bad lah then sense a different lor different vibe here

ya
oh ya ya ya so it's like a
oo
ya
is it like
is it like your senses are still intact eh for a few it's like paralysis
ya
you know I I would just feel stuffy because
ya ya ya
kan
mm
no lah it's just
ha
oh
ya
oh my my mum said like if

then do what
or really well what did you say

oh my
ya oh I think that's why okay okay
ya ha
cool pe
the thing leave
if the thing leaves
I think I watched ya
oh my god
good lah
the thing
ya good ah
but then you would know right if the thing wants you or not
ya
mm
okay
sincere ah
mm
same ah

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
uh it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
ah kids also starting school soon
um
when
march eh eh march april
I I think so
because uh now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and uh we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and uh rules like uh have lax a bit lah
so I think they would allow us to do to uh the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably uh direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing uh quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of uh the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should err you know
find some I uh
find the to get some quotation
what is err
what is your uh your your ideas for the renovation
uh minimalist
oh I
uh
I think open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
uh
ah
you are my uh private
cook
ya uh I will buy all the ingredient
and then uh I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter um
you want a you want to put like a uh you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
uh the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because ah ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better lah because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and uh moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food lah
ya
and then
ya
uh
to to uh depends on uh
mm
kan ah
mm ya I I think you you think that concept
err I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack uh uh the what you call that the the wall there
err
and then you uh you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
oh okay lah
ya lah
you think because uh Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the uh ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
mm
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
uh multiple attempt to
uh kill them
they uh they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
uh it uh spraying the the lizard repellents uh spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too lah the our our house here I think
uh the it's there's a lot of uh lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient ah even though I've tried to to to hit them ah is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
oh my god so uh I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
ah
err
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time lah it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners uh I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity lah it's a it's a need lah more of a need
necessity because everything has err you know
wears down you know
and uh our our kitchen looks quite dirty and uh rundown and uh
our our the uh you call it the flooring starts to uh wears down
ah ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and uh they feature a few uh lah but uh so far three D contractors uh in terms of
the the the outcome ah it it it suits our taste ah
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
eh very nice lah we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but uh ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that uh
not not not the sink ah kitchen tap
quite a few lah and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus oh one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the ah
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
aiya
I don't know lah it's both it is both uh frustrating and funny at the same time eh
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then err
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
uh
self guilt lah I think so I don't know lah
ya
cement
oh
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship lah
ya
ya the was
uh ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him lah probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain oh ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery lah but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
mm ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare lah how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how lah
which one we we want to choose
ah
so
mm
ya
major major lah
mm
mm
kan
one uh so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package ah
oh
ya
kan might as well kan
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
mm
mm mm
okay lah thousand five ah eh
so I think ya lah
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in uh uh in the future we have uh
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
ah
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring ah
I think that one is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that one the the more expensive one
mm
but have to
you have to ya lah everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the the budget can consider lah I think that one's quite expensive is around
wah but I find it like very good leh
and it's wireless
mm
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
uh brands uh
uh have that those type of uh two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that one very good ah uh I think
can can consider lah if we have the means
but now we aiya we see how for now we just use manually first ah
use the sucking mop ah
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
uh sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive ah
ya that one really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence ah because like I told you earlier on
err ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence lah
ya
mm
the specific uh ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
ah ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well lah
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
mm
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally lah ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya lah like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
mm
mm
uh I think this saturday we we settle uh akid's uh school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare akid uh school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
uh the the the the renovation ah
mm so actually we K we we need to ya lah we ours we we are the one who should
direct them oh we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration ah
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but ah ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

hey how are you
almost two months ago
kan
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
mmhmm
a'ah seh
ah sia like a blessing in disguise ah eh
okay lah
you heard
but
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now lah but um you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done ah
ya actually I am most of the time only like err two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
cause there are some like letters from err the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time lah
a few hours at least
in a week
ya lah I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
mm
huh as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
oh my gosh
mm
ya I know you always do lah you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere lah
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
oh
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you ah like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age um
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one um app away or one call away so
mm
is it I never heard of that before
mmhmm
oh my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
oh
mmhmm
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good ah
as cliche as it sounds lah
um healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my err to get my workout in ah on a daily
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it ah
ya
mmhmm
oh is it
mmhmm
what's the average ah what's the ideal
that's normal ah ah
that plays a part ah
ya mm
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
mm
ya lah it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more um you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad what I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face sial babe
oh no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
okay lah
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on lah
it's like that
ya
oh yes it's right there
you know me too well
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it eh is it K one or nursery eh
err K
there seven
oh
primary five eh
primary five ya
oh my gosh wait primary five
and then now we are like oh my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
even during school we don't really talk to each other kan
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
mmhmm
ah
mmhmm
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
mm
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know um from what you're telling me
like
the effort
is only at your end
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times lah but
you know like um in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow that really open up like
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay lah um being in a relationship of friends ah like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this um saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like err people come and go
and especially when the err when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men lah but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women eh I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay um you know
um you shouldn't get back to your err to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly kan err maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience lah but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense ah I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up ah
mm
mm
aww
aww so cute
a book like a diary
oh right okay
oh my gosh
eh but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
eh that is actually a good thing like um it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know um on paper
mm
then it hit you ah
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like um
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
um
mm
mm
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up ah then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
oh my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
mm
ya lah like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up eh not not the cause of your okay lah somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay lah I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya lah but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
aww
wow you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
eh oh my gosh
I mean
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly eh when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
err it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead lah it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on err cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay lah
you know
but err do you know if he's attached now or not
oh my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
oh is it
ya I don't give a shit anymore sia I can't even remember
eh isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah um let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
eh you don't don't say that about yourself lah you are amazing
mm mm
oh my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
eh ya oh my god I almost forgot about our makisan
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time

I will just err
uh
ah ya they did err I recently when I went they had this
position lah ya like two people
ya ya they block the seats ah ya so err okay lah I mean like you you I I
then like

like I still keep in contact with my secondary school friends lah let's see my primary school
my primary school
my primary school friends
my primary school friends err it's like err
they are not
they are not
err in contact with me much because they
they are quite busy with their own lifestyle already then I also not that close now with them

lah together so like ever since then
ya we still
ya we're still close lah
ya we also ah
mm
ya
ya ya ya like like
I ask hi how are they going
so ya sometimes it's good to ask lah how they are doing
so ya
mm
mm mm no lah
mm mm
ya
I see a'ah
opposite err not really I'm a very dynamic
I have a dynamic taste in music lah okay
I think cause sometimes I like loud music but sometimes also like like like indie also
ya introvert
ya sometimes loud music helps you destress mm so I decided and also
ya it's like
err emotional ah ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
just
lah
ah service ah
ya
so uh huh
struck an idea that that
ya so uh this is one way lah we can
err bring
bring it up
to them ya so
mm venture
I think
uh about
and
and stuff we are
err more more in depth
for the meantime so
ya I'll just use this opportunity lah kan
mm
ya I can see
err physically so we must monitor them by whatsapp or like ya like to liaise err with my contacts over there lah
uh ya
I think that's mainly what the the difficulties are the rest not so much
ya
ya
no lah I have a few a few friends they are doing it together with me ya
ya
one of them is not is a housewife lah so she she's just doing some side business also then ya so she's also doing this lah then for me and my other friend we are like working full time
ya so ya like ya this is like our part time lah time management so far okay
try to err minimise our workload lah
mm from day to day
ya
but uh I think it's okay lah it's a feasible business I think ah what about you like do you have anything like you want to start up with
or mm
mm
mm oh
nice orh nice
uh huh
mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya hopefully lah
hopefully
ya
a'ah
mm ya ya
opportunity for us
mm
kan
okay
ya honeymoon mm maybe consider ya
like that but actually err can say I'm more of a sightseeing kind of person lah
ya
I think
mm
ah ya that's way road trip yes
ya so
so
it's it's good lah to bring them
err better I mean
ah
ah okay lah interesting
ya
mm mm ah ya lah
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season ah mmhmm
mm
mm
I see actually no I mean
err spring is considered err winter right or is it after winter sorry kan ya but I I mean I personally also like winter lah
but err winter like it's very fun lah cause
aesthetically I would prefer err autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice lah ya
mm ya correct
mmhmm ya ya is like
once the this is all over kan
mm like you really mm
wow
it was it was actually during autumn lah that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
they are very err
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you one without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire lah about them
then so ya singapore err ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya lah but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way lah right
since young so
that's why
ah then orh
there's the bullet train lah ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no lah I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train lah it's just the high speed train which
like normal lah I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's uh the food
really
mm ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places what so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan

funny story err no no I didn't I sort of tried lah but not really insect but it's at thailand no cause okay there's this err you know at
chiang mai or something ah

is it like a cocoon ah or something ya so
it was like that lah
then I was like curious lah then my friend also like psycho me to try lah try

but I I I took one bite and then I I cannot
ya I can I cannot
I cannot err take it lah ya it was uh
mm mm mm ya eww
is it prawn no
ya I mean from the look of it also I can hear when they bite on it it's like so crunchy like

mm mm I know
ya you probably get stomach flu
mm staple food lah
orh
ya ya ya
this interesting interesting and disgusting but ya
mm yes
to speak more err err fluently mm you also don't get
to ask me much questions ya ya
ya mm sure sure
ya so like
mm
I don't know like err
like I see that
you have the latest iphone lah no lah what phone is that ah orh orh expensive
ya I know apple and their expensive products
mm ya actually okay lah I mean like err it's easy to use but camera wise ya there are some issues some some setbacks the back camera back camera ah ya the back camera lah
because like certain err photos I take like the lens ah I don't know why it's not wide or something then it will like zoom in
ya I think I'm not so sure about the others though but I didn't have this problem with my other phones ah my samsung and sony I use to use I use to use a sony phone
ah I like that so much ya use to be it use to be about music then now they change to camera lah ya
they have quite good
camera lens
on their phone ya so ya not bad
but ya but
samsung is like already way way ahead so that's why I
kind err drop
like jump ship lah samsung ah ya ya ya ya ya ya but I don't know is for me it looks it feels weird
or it's just me but it's it's it's it's like weird because
err the middle part is like split ya and then when you open it up it becomes like one big tablet or something right
then uh I don't I also don't really like tablet as a phone or
things like that lah ya okay lah
ya
but I see iphone twelve already but I heard what iphone twelve don't have charger lah
mm ya
the cable lah
ya ya you know I think what they use micro or something right ya ya
ya so it's been a great time ya

mm just rerun of friends and big bang theory
mm not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show leh
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay ah thanks
uh by the way uh what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya lah hopefully something will turn up lah after the after all the application
o
okay lah okay I take note oh ya by the way then that time uh besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix uh what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
oh ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see uh who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated uh hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and raquel finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my ah two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out ah but are you buying anything
eh
oh serious ah are you buying
oh ya then uh alesya belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
huh but azam isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay lah if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase ah
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what oh
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it lah I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true lah degree is important I'll think about it lah
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just uh rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree uh sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in uh in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored lah
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company ah I mean
uh usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he uh when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with uh a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
uh he is under maintenance side and technician uh if I'm not wrong uh under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know lah
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know lah I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as uh prison warden ya uh he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
uh the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace uh at just besides changi prison so
in a way beneficial for him lah don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place ah for him
if I'm not wrong ah
oh uh he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent uh not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they uh they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then uh they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong lah
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years ah that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then uh she told me about the benefit uh when she just join full time they even uh give you uh benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even uh
another friend of mine uh she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new khatib home ya she told me about it
they also provide err you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct lah but and all ya
err adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of uh fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company eh not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that err
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya lah just help me out if I need
fourth december he
uh fourth december ha
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
uh she told me err what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because uh she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated oh she also she also has degree by the way
uh chemical chemical science meaning I think err
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya uh right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while lah ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like jurong island that kind of thing that share more of like
uh exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay lah anyway
my bike what what you mean
mm my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
ah that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
uh tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation oh my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically ah what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now ah ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
um maybe lah I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same lah but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small uh company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me lah
oh ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
uh engineer but ya lah I mean wouldn't uh wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
uh if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay what
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
mmhmm
oh ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
huh I thought it's under your name
uh there are demo too young because
oh
ha chain
chain adjust
oh
alamak
oh that time he ask me err he he asked me that uh how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly lah how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as uh much more than his monthly but I told him lah
I told him ah that time I I hit about uh four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked ah my pay
was higher than him then tell him lah but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him lah the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him lah to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him lah
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure lah because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him lah
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him ah I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it lah
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
err
then he was he was shocked lah I say no lah because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked lah he he he judge but whatever lah I mean
I mean you just want to try try only what then and then I told him lah
like it's all up to individual lah I mean all
I I tell him what all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
uh I told him uh
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face lah
uh was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
roo is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket uh add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable lah because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
oh okay lah maybe I see about that
but okay lah I mean I wouldn't complain already lah I mean as long as the market is good already lah because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
uh now uh based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to hougang mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I uh she she ride but she put under but err bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her lah ah they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me lah what's the logic behind this grab enforcers oh I mean I'm working what but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say lah like
oh is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair what I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that sucks
okay I'll take note lah

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character lah
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
okay
so new sia
ah uh
mm
mm
mmhmm
clear about what he's getting
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
okay
mm because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
cough up lah information
mm
mm
go into that yes
ya
okay
ya which you you might not but you might not agree ah
ah ah mmhmm
ya ya lah but I guess baby steps then after that
did you did you specifically say that
ya mm
hmm
ah
mm
a'ah seh
okay so
oh so just the informal ya
ah
ah
mm
you said
mm
mm
ah
okay
dayah's ah ah
mm mm
so fed up ah this type of thing
I don't think he even thinks like this lah
oh
foresight a'ah
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not salim I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
haiya
I mean I haiya I don't know what to feel about this
ya
send ya
must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether uh I
pushed or zina will be pulled down
err big personality how to say not big lah firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
your life will turn out well
ah
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to dayah
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with izat
huh you talk about marriage to izat like what
this was before lah
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but zina can also ask you the same then why and why you and izat is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and izat are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya lah
ya lah because also also dayah always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya lah
ya ya
hidayah is clamping her down lah
ya ya
huh
ah ah ah where
you said that okay
okay
you said that ah then
ya
it's very hard and you will often require a certain mm
change of life events or certain

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
oh was it with his girlfriend also
serious oh is it because of his surprise birthday party uh
so what have you decided
eh how do you get her number ah I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
wah your friend is so going to feel betrayed sia
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
so dah decide
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
orh
but you think he okay or not
serious ah
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza lah
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever lah
oh
okay
oh forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
oh that's good deal man
eh can you share the link with me
mm
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
alah
oh okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
oh and fly kite
oh
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
oh but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter lah that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go ah that's the point
mm
actually that day
mm
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know fuh
okay actually to me lah is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like Razi did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places ah then what happen ah
oh he will ah okay okay um because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
oh okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice lah of the girlfriend
mm
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay uh Marina Marina Bay lah kan
Barrage if you got no car you go Sentosa
oh because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay lah
oh okay then Marina Barrage makes sense lah
yes yes yes
mm
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have meriahness if there is
I mean aiya for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true lah I I mean no I personally don't like Sentosa
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for Sentosa
earlier lah
oh it's a weekend ah
ah
okay
oh ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
orh
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before lah in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
ah okay
ah
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
Tampines
not the other side of the Singapore right
ah
ah okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
ah near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
oh my god
anyway motor is convenient ah
but I think
oh really
so early ah it's indoor what
oh you mm okay lah I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay lah
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
uh I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow lah huh
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people lah so I always leave it to other people
oh ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like ah
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better ah
food
okay all growing boys
ya but to me mm okay lah for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
oh okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
mm then what she say
oh my god
uh then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
uh mee tom yum mm one of them
no because now
ah
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason lah eh let's say
um
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time what
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme ah
oh it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
for what
are you serious
ya lah
so that you can focus on your work ah
you don't have any other friends meh
you have right
yeah
oh you got further subset of your
mm
I know I know you know I know I know already lah
a'ah
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap ah
ya lah
orh
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
wah I should make friends with this friend of yours lah
ah ya lah
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also lah
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you ah it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay lah no loss to him
yeah
yeah
so is no to him is no loss lah so that's why he's like that
do you do they know that you meet each other
oh they know ah so
ah okay
yeah and I know why you don't wanna go
yeah
oh confirm ah
it's confirmed
mm
did they did somebody you directly
alamak
uh huh
yeah you told me that
mm
now
it's okay
it's okay
orh
orh
you told me right is that the one
right the indian muslim one and the that one right ya
okay lah
hmm hmm
I don't know I don't I don't miss in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
oh Marissa Shu you never go before ah
I think if you go with Shu also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
oh
ya lah
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say ah
oh but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant lah but okay lah I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
mm
but they make you feel included lah
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that Shiqah Ad Razi group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean Aidil they all but I rarely get to meet him lah but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends sia oh and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
ah
but I think two person is much more better leh I feel lah
don't know lah I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
aiya but they going week weekend ah
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces seh
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
ah no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary ah
try ah
cannot ah
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who ah I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part eh
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
oh crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay what
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared sia
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
oh my god okay
oh
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
oh so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
ah he will say
a bit meh
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be Aidil lah up till now
actually actually is true eh
and then his mum will be left
aww
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
oh I don't tell her so that uh she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who ah
ah I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take ah I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
Kartini will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then ah whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already lah this one
then uh I remember lah the one in my secondary school is this
um very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
oh ya we we I tell you we are nerds what we can spend in library from nine eh nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
um was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so eh
no I'm busy for but I think on weekends when I have no
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it ah
crash study crash
crash lah they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
uh so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level ah in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the uh after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask uh hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
oh
surprise
cannot lah sia I will be stressed
okay lah
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age ah
I realised I
eh don't tell this to Farid ah cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days lah
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
oh my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort ah
drill
bit
ah ya
oh shit

switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level I took O level I take I took sec two O okay

you ask her it it kiap the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
wah that's a nice phone is that Ada's phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek lah we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay uh
oh in the morning when you come then you ask each other eh
geography lah geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater huh
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level ah
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
ah
ah because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
uh yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
oh sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
uh arts uh sports and
uh I don't know geek lah I would categorise uh debate as geek lah I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood lah it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek lah okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool lah debater oh I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why eh I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game um minefield
eh that one is I tell you ah
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject lah
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch oh
like how curious a a kid is oh why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the oh so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I oh the only reason why I went for that course was because ah ah ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
uh who err so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late uh we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up lah basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
ah
eh come on lah I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he hor we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say eh you know ah
actually the head prefect saw my face already ah just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl ah
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class lah
eh so and so so and so saw my face already know wah if he see that I disappear already ah sure he will mark me one
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school lah sia
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
walao eh this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention lah
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually uh supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself lah
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no lah of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
oh
a'ah
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
oh my god
oh but the discipline master doesn't know you personally ah
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai kia ah
all cannot make it sia
ah
huh
eh actually primary school classes are the worst to manage ah
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths ah okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that one especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun lah they are innocent ah so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can ah if ya

mm
orh
oh Jetstar
okay
orh
ah
okay okay
and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
mm
mm
mm
mm okay so because kan you are the type of
mm
mm
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook lah so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things lah so I felt like
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon lah then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then
uh
so it was a bit weird lah ya
I know right oh my gosh ya
enjoying my sleep lah
then after that leh
the car outside kan
the but then I try to look out the window lah I wanted to kaypoh lor
and uh
ah so ya like that lor
so that's what happened
then after that
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
okay
oh
oh my god
eh that's so bad leh
mm
oh
so that's where I get my news also lah TikTok and Instagram

ya so
I understand
so ya so then kan
ah you know actually this year
save money so that I can like buy a house here
ah okay
oh
oh
oh oh that's very good
okay
ya
so then it's like
it's like if you have in the reports kan it's already been stated that if you have any underlying conditions
you know or uh
and actually touch all these
ah
ah
and looking forward to phase three lah
okay
ya
oh
mm
okay
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
ya
ya lor that's true
if let's say you were the prime minister
okay
of the highest number of COVID cases
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
okay
oh that's not good
mm
ya
ya
as if lah it's so easy kan
mmhmm mm mm
it
so
so ya
so then
so today
so then oh uh so that's why this morning
I'm
so the breakfast wrap was only four dollars sixty five cents
but
uh it's one for one so end up the thing became only two dollars lah
so ya
ha and some more my pillow covers are all white
so it's like the thing turned red lah because
it will stain or if I wear anything white it will stain
ya but whose hair will be after you dye
exactly
ya but then but when it's wet it will stain my towel lah
mm
so ya lor like that lor
and then
eh

ah
mm
mm
oh okay okay

mm
unless we have this type of project lah
ya you know a little bit of extra do no harm lah kan
mm
so
mm
not right not right now only that I want to take my time and then we see what happens lah
mm
ya
so and and then actually
mm just
you know
have a career change
mm
mm
ya and then we ya so
and then so that's why it's a bit like
so ya
mm
like singapore living cost is a bit high
save a little bit more to make sure that you know that your parents are well taken care of lah so
step by step I guess one day at a time
mm
mm
mm
um
hong kong paris dubai
mm
kan
ya
eh
the furthest he will go is changi
the furthest he will go is changi
he won't go anymore where further than that
mm
mm
ya
that travel agencies will bring her to all these weird places kan
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
oh my gosh
right
ya
orh
only when I'm at home
mm
ya that's true
so then that what is the point of taking the leave you see
on leave
then I also take the leave
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm okay okay I see I see
mm I see
ya
so ya so you know I wrote an email to my management err my housing management because like
um
ya
to um
you know make sure that the the rubbish is thrown properly and responsibly lah ya
you mean I stand outside the rubbish chute and wait for the person to not throw the rubbish
no lor on the floor every floor or itself don't have the lor only got is in lobby
mm
um
oh okay
korean drama K drama is like
not really my thing lor but then I can try lah see how lah
a'ah
mmhmm
ya exactly
is that the word you were looking for
ya
not so well because I'm not used to it
more of like english songs lah
then
after that
um
ya
so then I was like a bit like
um I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have err to go uh with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
um
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
um
mm disrespectful because it's like
like
you know um single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
ah
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said oh weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
um
oh uh don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
a'ah
okay
so ya
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but
mm
ya
huh
the cases it reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
mm
so they are all back in lockdown
mm
mm I think so
mm
and the infection is is more um
the the virus is more infectious
mm
mm
uh
job offers
mm
mm
ya
you
become prolonged because
err
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
uh nationwide
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the and
china
were not good at managing it
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
mm
mm
ya
exactly
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
you when you compare to
and it's very diverse that's why people like it here
and
ya
yes lor
hmm so ya
uh and then it's right in the middle of botanical gardens
mm
ya
mm
a'ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
um hmm
and then had to like
mm
mm
mm
mm
orh
presentation
oh
ya
ya
oh
oh
ya very like uh demotivating lah
mm
oh
oh media agency lah
mm mmhmm mm mm
mm
like err
ya
ya
mm
ya so
anyway
err
mm ya
okay
okay thank you bye bye

okay I think we're recording
err so my name is Umar and my conversation partner today is
so
so okay obviously okay I start eh so basically um
then after that um when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in Jakarta err celebrating Chinese new year lah
um the the the hype so called or the whole issue err it it went up and then
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore um and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then um the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and uh at first I was going to work and slowly um you see more and more people
um we were eventually taken over by um okay eh at first it was China lah and then second it was Singapore
at first ah this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries uh in Italy
is the highest lah so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
err but that's how I remembered my experience um when it first started err and how at that point of time I was
let's put it like um I wasn't employed anymore err after this whole situation so now looking for job lah
some authority figure ah
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
ya and
I think
and say that uh you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen err
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say err I understand
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that err gone viral for no reason
um
Hadi dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see Hadi kan
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny ah but I saw the article lah I think Mothership covered this article about him
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes kan
because if you think about it um just the fact that during this whole uh circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
err actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
err the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
mm mm
mm well I have this opinion about uh all these food delivery ah so to my understanding ah
but err food delivery eh so I feel that um it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all um
and they are blue err blue collar workers kan so think about this for a second eh to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to um like basically if you apply kan most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for uh the lower income group to catch up
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it kan so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar err job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about err food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day lah for example on her electric err wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is ah okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is um you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet lah
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to err
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway um with regards to that uh there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
err err employment
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis lah in singapore so whether you are uh as mentioned before whether you are
err low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide kan
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver kan
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab err you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your err err picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really err let's say you already have a bicycle lah let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
so it it simplifies a little bit
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
it has that sort of it extended flexibility ah and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way lah it's just something I just thought about recently
maybe err do a three hour trip err three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home lah so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
uh as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that um a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such uh active um kind of employment especially for the lower income uh people to help a bridge to the higher income people
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
err it does
um so during the circuit breaker period of pe was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing um did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery err did you meet anyone or
oh okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
no lah if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say eh I'm doing this err exam err next week
err I pay you two hundred dollars lah just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay pe
seriously
right well characters is something inevitable
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
I think also it depends on school as well ah because when I was in uni uh um a lot of people who went to like me kan they err
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
so in a way you can balance oh out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but err
sometimes err if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
err for a couple of years you actually um understand and appreciate what err higher academia can bring compared
to your peers err in school at the moment kan even for myself kan if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and um if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or uh it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
um you know it's the uncertainty of err okay lah
you know if I don't do well then don't do well lah you know but uh once you are in a position where you are out
is very exhausting and um some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful err well kudos them
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks lah toilet lah
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people um
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
err I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
um if doubly is even a word for studying
so aiya I mean so
I don't know eh ultimately it is a state of mind lah so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type err Foodpanda pro
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but err if you go now it's definitely available
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well Nurul didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker lah so it's a different story but for those people who
suspect until the end of the year ah
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went Jakarta once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February what
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in err late January it was Chinese new year I had to go Jakarta but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May err April or something ah it didn't happen anyway so ah whatever lah
just need a break cause okay if you think about it kan people other than Singapore
who
ah that one is err he was so desperate for diving that one also is
ya
yup
nope it says err fifty seven minutes
on my timer
ya
so man I don't know now
you you're only as old as you feel
sleep is for the weak having said that I got a class tomorrow at nine thirty
what am I doing recording this at two in the morning
you you go for more class I'm going for volunteer class you are going for to get re-educated upgrade education
you paid for
I use I use the SkillsFuture is paid for
I still had to pay about err thirty plus dollars that's all just uh a top up ah
twenty five thousand dollars ah jer
I paid more for my education in my uni hello
but but I already paid my loan so I'm good no problem
what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
hmm
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour

all right
ya
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit ah
is it
shit
I don't know what went wrong ah honestly ah honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic ah I was like
even if I was the instructor
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit ah
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike ah
but apart from that
I think
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know ah cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
and I accepted it lah ya but today
um I started out with the mini circuit
like it was me and it was that that that that girl lah so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance ah maybe today I might pass ah that kind of thing
but no
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
then I said oh then
then why I cannot the same ride again ah
so
oh so that was me and then about that girl
she was um she was okay she she also failed
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back ha so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
and then
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there lah
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place eh I already down to gear two already even before that ah
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there ha my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that lah that's why he stood there
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
then after that uh she was trying to pick up the mood
no I was still on my bike
ha instructor instructor was there all the while ha so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
ha you concentrate or your bike ha you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall ah because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver lah maneuver the the turn but she
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
ha cause it's it's a bend what
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no lah I'm okay lah okay
then after that like
after that uh when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
uh the instructor tell me he said uh
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her kan he say you just go ahead first ah
ha prac one
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
when I got the results I was like
the fuck sial
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
no to me
really meh you use your foot brake what
really
huh
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
oh class two ten seconds slower ah
ha
but you but on on on gear one right
ya lah half clutch ya actually can what
is it
serious ah
ah
harly from this cafe racer you going to change to harly it's a big difference you know oh bobber bike kan that one ah the mutt the mutt the mutt but mutt is what country eh is it mutt ah
mm
confirm ah
ah
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred ah
ya lah that's why
bikes is it was it bikes there was one retailer there was one retailer that sells that bike
mm
huh who
oh
sanfu ah
paya lebar
for the mutt the mutt ah how much
excluding
machine price
oh inclusive a'ah
last year's was how much
ten thousand plus
ha
that bike is expensive ah
zontes cheaper ah
huh the mutt thing
zontes
ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening ha
sell out your bike first
mm
mm
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
mm mm mm
I think that you should consider that
there are many people who have class two bikes ah
but they all stop at super four

sixty
oh ya ya ya mmhmm
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four four

mm
forty eight ya
for every

fifteen I think sixteen litres ah
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty

because I'm on gear two what I didn't stop I want want to actually don't need to stop didn't ask me to stop but it's give way what it's not
it's not uh it's not a stop line
so I went to throttle but I think what happened was the the there was skid mark on the floor
so I throttle the whole bike went this way sia
I cannot turn
too fast already ha so just one thing slip so instead of the bike flying
so I fell out with the bike was on the ground already you know engine still on ah bike was on the ground eh no no engine like stop

oh my god ah

thank you
sexual health
there's like sexual health plastic surgery you know personal finance take stock is a treasure trove if you know how to use it well
okay so the you know the um with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically um it's a K pop song by shinee
um ya so um so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny uh K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
it's I never heard I never heard
oh okay okay uh maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
I recently learn this term it's called um um
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like for example uh
what what's the oh ya ya ya ya I know it's so true oh my god
eh nasha
ah I mean like that number ah the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so um like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
um because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily uh loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main um
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like err an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on uh any
uh any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
ah tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated oh I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize eh you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once uh once it realizes that eh this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin to see you
oh wow
oh oh wow amazing wow
grab ge</mandarin knows you but you don't know his name
okay okay okay
wait so when you say that you gave him coins like how does it work cause I'm not familiar with the contract

then how do the other students like do they catch up or are they behind
like the first thing cause I would maybe I was to focus on like myself but I didn't notice the second it was fine because I was surrounded by jokers
oh right right right
something ya
just breathe what's the studio called by
oh right so I'd just
ah beat factory
how many phones do you have
oh my god this one
is it for your games
so the new phone is on for your games
wow
is that his live dah start

mm
okay okay
oh okay okay
right
okay
oh ah oh what the qualities
oh oh my god
there's a post to his live now
all these ge</mandarin watching on a saturday night
ah
mmhmm
aww
do both right right right
so like one phone is like watching his live and the other phone is like your maples lah
hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching anime
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got saiki
the disastrous life of saiki
oh that's good
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like um slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called saiki um
like exploded
strength ah yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also uh teleport um
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole anime
ya it's just him
the whole anime revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep uh people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole anime he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
um you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
um I don't know it's about twenty three plus
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like wow
right right I should have finished like one season
ya ya
oh ya ya ya ya
I'm starting there
ya you really have to get into it
oh
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a gundam series on kids central
oh
ya
mm mm
yes yes
yes
mmhmm
ya
okay okay
mm
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact gundam I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
mmhmm
oh okay okay
hmm
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into gundam and you're like no
gundam
ah it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now um
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet lah correct
um so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
ah no I think it's still with aisyah okay nevermind that's fine
ya so um
I I told her like eh sorry ah I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would um
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch um
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw ah I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya um it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze um there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends lah or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is err five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really um topics that you don't understand like uh explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because um
I like to read like I like tea you know to um
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their um comments is always oh this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad lah I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
oh ya so back to ah so um so I asked her like uh can you give like uh
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere lah and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
izz can easily catch up eh
ah okay lah not bad lah
oh yes
not bad
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
mm
ah
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
oh okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
oh my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
um this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with sha it was after A levels
um I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about uh this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
um came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian um
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this um spies
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
wow really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was um a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and uh so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like oh I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you um
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
uh huh like nudity or sexual references uh ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending oh it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
mm
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like oh okay wow
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it oh my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
ya alah
ah right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
um this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya wey or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with haikyu she was really into haikyu her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that um but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance uh series
when I was younger lah when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
a'ah
it really impacted the way um I saw how relationships or is
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
ya
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so uh so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like uh thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out um it was from this girl
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial um like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like oh my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have uh this kind of like
uh ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
uh fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like um
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
yes it is idiot
so okay so tup tup they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so uh he was looking for her
a'ah
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like um like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like oh my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay lah when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything um
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
ha it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean um the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
with uh starting mira filzah and if you know adi putra
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first mira filzah was twenty four seven
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult lah logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head ah ah
the instant ha instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid um commercial shampoo commercial

mmhmm

eh ah I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
mmhmm
huh
is
we'll see
uh huh
a few cartons
mm
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
hmm
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
can lah if not you can just order in
mm
ya that's true
mm but it's quite expensive lah but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
eh
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
mm
mm
hmm ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle lah but lucky he is not using because he's uh on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
mm
ya that's true
hmm
ya that's true
mm
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched lah I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
hmm
some of them even went to uh try
wah it's really you have to work extra hard for this uh
mmhmm
mm
oh
oh
mm
that's long
mm maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying uh well
mm
oh
mmhmm
mm
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then um my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of um what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive lah on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
um having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary kan

so it's all about you
want to
disrupt other people's family or what then you know their plans
but still
then
eh then then okay then if example eh
then imagine if papa want to pass away then she then he have to pass down or whatever shit
if have to pass down to females we are the only two
I don't know
male female
then would you take it
if it if they have to pass down to female
then that means I have to take it
why
why can't you sacrifice for me
why can't you sacrifice for me
half half
no should take like
on
on even weeks
of the year follow me on odd weeks of the year follow you
ya
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places what
all the haunted places
then that time I I tell I thought I told you before
then I when um they say always go in even numbers right went in odd
then I was the only girl and I was having my menses
except for me
then after that

then while sitting there a black figure was
like
you know I can feel all these right
and and the black figure
all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung uh
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
no eh they were asking me black figure then I was like no like it's you can't blame me there's two other
people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
mm what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
ah
then like eh
I don't know
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not
eh no he got nine wives so so I you be ten then I'll be eleven
no the lina's cafe is not his it's one of his wives
I don't want to
number eleven is more prettier than me
marriage
they can only stare at you
because I can't help you
why I don't know ah

I feel you
I feel you because I see you

mm name
oh
when was that
when was that that you went to
ah that one her business just started on February seh
she went down to the shop she saw her husband
ya she talked to to ah the person lah the Aminah but she never talked to the husband lah
ya she was there
no she only have seventy dollars like what
I mean but but we are so lucky that we are we never take a lot lah eh
ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty
but then again I don't know I until when she's gonna do this cause
at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
mm
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week ah fourth month uh fourth week
mmhmm
oh in fact she mmhmm
ya ya true
then suddenly become her husband delivery friend whatever
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct Thai supplier cause she is the one who gave Aminah Muslim this number the contact lah so
that's why
kan so she is going to go babe this kind of thing eh once you do this kind of thing eh maybe you get shiok with it ah you get carried away with this scam kan but the you still can pay is okay you know but once you cannot pay ah that's it your name will be viral all over the social media I'm telling you honestly
kan
mm oh really
where you saw outside or
mmhmm
she selling at twenty two dollars or something like that if I'm not wrong
but but but then again uh they take from the same supplier the one that I order lah

mmhmm
mm baby will be sending on Thursday night is it
and then this one I want to ask her to give me the orders by by tomorrow lah actually she already give ah later lah this wholesale lah I don't know she want or not
then Thursday she have to transfer to me
ah ya but Su Muhammad
ya like like real like that ah
mmhmm like ours ah like the ruffle dress I thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
kan
mmhmm no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell lah I don't know why
ah like like ya
ah yes yes like Natalie Bella you see Natalie Bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what I mean
so ya I think we need to invest lah but then again I don't see lah we don't need to take a lot of stocks lah anyway for me lah eh I don't really
mmhmm
yes
true
defects
they will ask for a refund
and you know to to to run the shop
but if to to be in a shop everyday I don't think I'm looking forward to that cause that's not where I see myself as unless maybe I don't know my my son and daughter grow up
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm I did a flea market before

sec three or sec four lah that time
and it's very tiring seh it's very tiring oh my gosh
mmhmm boss

ah she wants to quit her job yes
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
mm
she offered she offered but I don't want
knowing her you see how different ah from that live with my live
mmhmm
anyway if I do for her it's I never come out the money what
right so she is the boss
babe the friend staying condo lah the friend shipped ah buy the stocks lah cause when I heard the live ah she said self-collect at Woodlands not at Tampines
so it's from the house
oh somebody is crying is it

botanical garden
ya
ya
ya it is
ya it's err very bare minimum nothing really to see a lot we don't get to see alter we only get to see the model
ya
and it's moving definitely that's why I'm like away from me just in case
when the moment you say that what if it's gonna jump I'm like oh god okay I'm gonna back off girl back off now
you
damn
oh my god they can
oh damn damn
ya I think I was very young let me see primary school then we went to the zoo that was very small also so when I look at it the alligator like the biggest thing I've seen in the tank like super huge to me
I was like fuck this is like what a dinosaur alligator or what
ya and I will most like lead my way towards where they gonna feed the crocodile cause I didn't know that is like a way for the for the rangers rather than for the people
and then they have to shout like come down what you doing there come back now oh there's where we feeding the alligator come down oh no cause I was like run back down
mengheadache
err
chey
hmm
like
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in pulau ubin or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
ah there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two
ya that's crazy
ya
mm
I'm in a mess I'm in panic mode
ya so
I just
so one day when she's going to macritchie I got slapped on my face by a monkey so ya
but not the older one
you have a lot of acts a lot of emotion has developed
and they're trying to steal your bottles you don't bring any food or drinks you know
pulau ubin
ya
the mangrove
monkeys ya
no eh
uh oh no
hop on her bag
ya
ya
bottle cap
because he's very sneaky you know I assume it's a he lah I don't see the bird bird or what you know
they were on the rail bridge and then the monkey look at me
so I'm just going to like okay I just shut up let him do his business so the monkey go and took the bottle water away
mmhmm
okay
alright
oh
mmhmm
mmhmm
what the heck
okay
alright
oh
oh my god
oh my god
ah ya ya ya
mm mm mmhmm
it's crazy
oh my god
oh my god
what do you do
wah this teacher scold
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
ears
okay
uh huh
ah
mm mm
uh huh uh huh
to whack ah uh
oi
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really ah
I went I went ostrich farm
then
ah
they don't really like um sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
and the baby like bathing the babies
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
is it birds
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
uh huh
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have leh
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
mmhmm
oh
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous ah
now cause
oh my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
oh what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve sia
just crucial
ya
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else ah food err shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
mm
mmhmm
they have the
assertion
two weeks
mm higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know lah what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was ah
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself lah he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
hospitalised
ya
kan
ah
uh huh
same ya
phase two
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think the annoying part is like okay ah aside from business lah like how the work function now is
so um
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment ah rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible lah
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course err because of your work function ah but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office oh
it depends on your work already mah
ya
ya
mm
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings ah weddings most affected ah
a batches
ya so we got our friend wedding coming up in november
err but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective lah who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person ah that kind of thing ah but also she can't be very
restrict lah about two who would potentially can be invited
um
it's just err sad lah didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
yup
mmhmm
ya
um hmm
ya must come to terms lah
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
really
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth eh it's not breathing out
ya
I see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always I think now they gone crazy with social media and Facebook Instagram all this or YouTube
it's the best thing for them lah
social media the next thing ah
so I think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven

eh sorry I like to interrupt you sorry okay then before you go into your guitar story um you are actually a drummer kan
oh
ya
no no oh ya
oh ya ya ya ya
mm
ya
album ah
no then err because um you suddenly switched to
ya that phase then err that one like because I wanted to learn but I I I I suck at it kan
ya separate ways ah mm
okay what was the first artist
you know like try to err listen to this kind of like but I don't know lah back then I I swear to god like I I I tried to listen to other forms of genres ah like like drum and bass or
sub genres ah oh
because
oh
ah
ah
yes
you want to become the artist
ah
ya ya ya ya
okay
ya
back then
context ah oh
eh really ah
err
oh
what was the name of the brand
okay okay
ah
mm

wish eh
then for you
three months
oh like how is it
twice a week
ah not bad lah
oh you met the the mum
okay
ya lah
uh
mm
eh
right
oh okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you ah
but you guys haven't fought right okay lah
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
oh
I think it will take a while lah
one year
K lah
um I think one year okay maybe six months ah
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
mm
mm so
mm
mm
mm
oh
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
mm
mm mm
mm
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
mm
ya I mean take a risk ah if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
kan I mean that's what I would do lah
then um okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of ah
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly lah what kind of course he wants cause like
mm
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
oh okay okay
there's a master's in uh lasalle
uh err east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay lah like
cause if you just study jer kan
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy ah
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
mm
mm mm mm
okay two years ah
when
ya
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that lah I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your um
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet ah
but for you
mm
uh
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive kan then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare ah
oh
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
tuas tuas
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
PayNow uh uh seh
clubhouse
okay
oh okay but it such a weird place lah to like get a get married at uh at tuas
ya I mean if you're up for pulau tekong kan
like I'm if you're if you're up for pulau tekong you're up for pretty much anywhere seh but I think you don't want sentosa right sentosa is too touristy for me
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
oh ya you just book the cruise lah you just get one cruise uh uh
then you get married in the on the water
uh
uh uh seh
like like go all out lah
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
uh mocktail lah mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
uh huh
oh nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
oh okay okay okay
mm
ya I know
okay so like what do you guys get
uh uh
brunch menu mm
mm
okay lah best lah
mm
mm
mm
then you barbecue yourself or what
oh K
oh K K ya lah like buffet lah then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
mm ya ya ya
eh but no barbecue pineapple is nice
oh
oh because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly lah I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
aww it tasted like meat ya
mm
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was um
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first one
um
ah seh or you can go with us lah like me and uh me and hafiz so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also lah then at least there's some a bit of
mm
mm
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay lah so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that lah obviously
really ah
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
err show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
mm
mm
uh
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover seh
like even
if they they recover like if johor is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
mm
mm
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
uh uh
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it lah
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck ah ah cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
mm
ya
ya
uh uh
ya ya ya
mm
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad ah
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
ah luck luckily like mm I alighted much like err quite fast lah so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
uh
uh huh
ya
ya
mm
ya
uh
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit uh
uh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay
uh
okay
uh
uh and just be aunties lah
ya ya ya ya
mm mm
uh uh seh
uh uh
ya
mm
ah ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like oh my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to ah ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
mm
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm how how their conditions were right
oh my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
uh
uh
uh
mm
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb jer ah cause no choice kan ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order ah law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then err some people made a a like sarcastic kind of err remark it's like err go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this one they say go to hospital because they found out like
uh
uh
that time ah
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like err you you don't you can't transmit anything lah so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work seh
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more leh then I'm like oh my goodness
uh
this kind of like way to combat right uh uh it's like I read it I cannot forget seh then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous

okay we can start talking now ah so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
oh ya ya
I don't think it was part of the rediscover thing I don't know the whole list isn't out yet right

then
ya my career futures is a lot of
mendaki have opening but that time they wanted someone with a degree of sociology
ya
it's good full time already now
true lah but okay lah
but it's okay lah crowne plaza now got staycation package mah next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook mah mama can cook
but she eat ramen all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree

oh
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
oh
why sia
ya ya ya
all medics
my time it was like optional
they expect you to go
mm
ah
that's cool
the this captain from
err division yishun
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
so ya
oh ya my last
you know my err last duty
eh no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much lah but most of the time we still try ah just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare ah unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing lah
to do that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay what actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
ah
ya
err they started right after I
as in
ya that's true
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
so I think like the
orh firefighter

orh so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge lah
ah so so if anything like the will take charge of the call lah
what
ah ya
oh then
ah I see I see
ya
orh they want to put people into the
ah
eh but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is ah high intensity
ya let me google ah high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
make it better
I I also don't know
that kind of thing but ya
I heard they was like they were starting to do it
quite often relatively often
serious
mm

eh but ons
oh
sian hopefully your next cycle gets better
what the fuck
workload and the
uh huh
if and turn out at the same time then how
orh okay

mm
and
face something new

ah like I never
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download

no idea
it's M something is on the halal eater page lah
no it's at uh it's at a building is like I would say like like a office building
explore right and try halal options in singapore
yes
err he he we shared the food
ya so that was our dinner our short and sweet dinner
we we did we did we went to west coast park
the mcdonald's there the mac cafe there ya so the the mac the west I think the mac cafe the mcdonald's is twenty four hours
ya
ya how mm
ya yes he did
what about you eh what did you do yesterday night
oh it's like among the cheapest lah in at among parking lots parking spaces
that's quite good eh quite cheap
oh
the the lor mai kai is damn nice eh very nice ya
you missed the chance
what noodles did you uh did you wanted to try
ban mian okay
it feels good ah
ya
unusual superpower
err
hmm I think one of the most obvious ones would be the ability to grow money to grow money because I think err if I have all the money in the world I can actually help lots of people ya deep eh
it is nice ya
teleport
err actually I I I said that because like err my I was watching this like interview of my favourite celebrity korean celebrity and she said that so I want to emulate it's hyorin lor hyorin the sistar one
so and I think is a very good err superpower superpower cause I think right now um you know with money we can actually do lots of stuff
answer politically right answer
I actually saw this err one movie recently on netflix right is called I boy
ya so it's it's inspiring lah I would say inspiring movie I boy the movie title is I boy but he is a high school student high school err high school is it middle school I can't remember okay middle school
like to turn to lah in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels
I think err I think it's is somewhat true lah because I think it is somewhat true because like uh if you were talking about right there's um the number of malay the malay population in is very little ya and some more we are already the minority like err there's not a lot of us err compared to the chinese the chinese people back in school so it's much much lesser
he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think err that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he um he is he intends to go uni ah because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it will be a very rewarding experience
education ah
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity uh to have to access err to access uh all these various uh resources I think it will be nice lah for everyone ya not saying that err the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools lah I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do lah
mm
ya
in their head ya
equality versus
equality ah
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
oh if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
err
so you want the world to freeze the time
vampire
vampire werewolf okay okay if you if you err if you if you get to choose right will you be vampire or werewolf
um
okay actually I want to be vampire also you know why cause less hair
she is one in like ten
of course you can you can change him from a human to a werewolf
society

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay
mm interesting rolls royce okay
oh so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him lah you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so wah when he joined what was his uh education uh certificate diploma so so he join uh it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant uh then he gets to stay there with his family
mm ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house lah well that's good that's good so so he so he's uh he told you that he signed bond for five years with uh
five years okay so uh is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree oh okay I think uh singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face ah
oh it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but ah but who will pay for this uh school the company or the company will reimburse
oh that's good
if you have to stay until the company
mm that means err work and study ah ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
oh really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good um
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so err for a wait
when when did when did I said err when err I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then um
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
mm so what she working as now oh searching
almost a year so until now no job
oh okay so did she graduate from or
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so uh maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then uh then can just move on lah
anyway
so uh what's the status about your bike
uh the so when is it going to change the
uh cover set what's the plan
yes
okay so meaning still need to do something to the bike so this time is engine not the exhaust okay both so the mechanic still in process me ah in a way he grew there
okay very good
uh okay um good to hear ah hopefully it will not extend beyond january
okay why to bring the bike to go where
fireworks ya so um
what's the plan for you and your hundred dollar voucher actually
so
okay ya ya they have to queue for more than four hours at uh orchard hotel
where you know about this
oh okay okay someone like review
what hotel is that do you know
oh okay concord um it's quite old anyway um so about this uh we were talking about your job right so you're you graduated with uh diploma in engineering correct engineering informatics so pretty much is engineering lah okay like azri's job
uh like ah azri's job um that one is more to or engineering
mostly it's engineering electrical rovers
okay
oh assistant engineer ah
mmhmm
oh is it
your friend
ya
uh any particular companies that you are eyeing for
tivo ya
okay so do you know if they are hiring
maybe you just get the email then can just drop her an email if it's the same person lah
mm okay okay then um
so that means you just mentioned just now uh how about okay it also open right
so is that something that you can see yourself doing oh okay okay
okay okay okay so depends on what is it lah ya also not choosy right for now okay that's good then so for uniform group okay that's good okay um okay let's see

oh okay
went away ya
I I don't know the the name of the spider
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya oh no
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
mm
ya
so um
ya
carry err
okay okay
okay
you tried
oh
huh in thailand
okay
mmhmm
cocoon
okay mm
because err some people always say that okay obviously um the
err obviously is like um the the the insects that is sold um for you to like can be consumed they say that it's err clean but you know it's clean um
but I still find disgusting even though like um they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to um to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
err you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
orh
ya
ya ya ya
oh ya maybe probably ya but um
very interesting to see like uh maybe you you know err like like even when um when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
err is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a um they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them kan the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically um I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get um halal food because mostly err they eat like
yup okay
so I mean err
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that um I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have err been jumping a lot of topics but it actually err
you know connects us our conversation to to speak err
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we um when we we we talk is always on err whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can err do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
um
any any other questions that you want ask me
because I know you are a very curious person kan so probably you might want to ask
oh so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it oh it isn't the latest lah the latest kan is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay err ya I mean err it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
more to the back
ya
oh okay okay
but how about other android phones I mean android can be like samsung um err like err nokia you know all these
sony okay sony is um
the music err have good quality
camera okay I'm not quite updated I've been an iphone user
okay
okay
that's that's uh that's good
oh ya I think um ya that's quite ya the downside of it lah I mean we we've been paying
quite a hassle because usually the normal kan but then ya

okay can start already
good I'm good
we
video call each other kan
was it my assignment
was it google meet facetime
zoom zoom eh
because the last time we met physically was like
before COVID kan
that was like
many many months seh
ya
so
err how have you been like I mean how's your work been
ah
so like err were you affected
I see
so like are you working from home now or what
mm
like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring lah
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like alah online jer pe
ya
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
like
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya lah but now um it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
ah ya lah ya lah I mean
I'm trying
ya true
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
mm liho
kan
eh but I've been doing this err one cardio tau
err this one channel
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
so
then um
video
oh no I think
songs you know music so
to me
quite quite quite quite fun also
ah ah
because for me like
be consistent ah
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ah ya
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
um
okay lah maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
the orangey type or the white one
you you still use it lah
oh
we met in err
primary school ah
wait
wait
so if we met serious primary three
oh my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
oh my
eh but actually kan
but actually
our friendship is like random
kan because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other kan
close
yes then
wow you know I'm an introvert kan then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
ya
oh my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay lah okay lah let's not go that direction
oh about my boyfriend eh
okay lah okay ah I think
mm
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay err what was the last time that I told you about him eh do you remember
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
err eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because kan he um because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
kan so like um
his condition kind of worsen tau
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him lah got worse
he
something wrong err there's something wrong with his kidney
so
for the for the for the appointment
ya but then
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
throughout this whole um
so like
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
mm ya
ya because
like
mm okay
okay actually kan that time he asked me tau
okay
okay this is very cliche but
like
like like like you said relationship
but
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know eh because you know my soft spot for my ex kan
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to err my friend
that guy
ah like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my my mood
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
kan
actually kan to think of it I think he was like my only best friend tau
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit seh double blow ah in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
um like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay lah I was a shitty person
then
ah
we bump into each other and then
keep like letters
pictures
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I basically I tried to flirt with him tau
no
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
err it was a not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
oh wait no or was it a date
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
I think so lah I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
then
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
err what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said um
because that's me as a person that's my personality
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again lah
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me um
traumatised
seriously
he's just so
ya
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious seh I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day
I asked him out for a catch up session

uh um
um
uh
um
err ya then err
ah ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
oh yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get um
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad err cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it um ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
uh any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but um
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back uh just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it um even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but um maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me err excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not um just buy err knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya err just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that um which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work um then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes ah okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then uh you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say err when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss johor so much our old house ya but now it's um make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it ah abu
oh it's a terrace oh okay
yup because ah it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and err I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun lah ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase abu
sticky sambal I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's uh it's whatever happens um
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
um because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper what I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger ramly burger ramly that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of err cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup err sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go johor and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that abu
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
mm I think so
um ah we went to cycling um
ah we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge err you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
ah and we tried um tried their ah that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it uh you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say abu like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
um yes because I was um for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
um I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
oh wait I can't um
oh actually I think I didn't went um
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or uh high elements in um school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay um my camp was at the pulau ubin there ya
um I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the uh I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore um ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to um rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
um you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
um I remember um
I can't um in secondary school we did a lot of things
um like uh like camps mostly camps
err give I remember um chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days uh and then what else oh err it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time uh in our secondary school um we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
um cause we had we change our principal I um our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they uh do uh about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
um ya
and all of them all of these charities err will be donated to the uh respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs lah for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that uh you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy err to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games ah and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you err I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
uh plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
mm ya and we have a lot of programmes lah actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme um like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed um how the way how they speak
we and their english ah the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that um I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup err from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them lah ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type lah actually um but ah for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you err like example for me uh I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
err
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like um ya um
it's like school also but no ah I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
um
sports there's a lot ah actually ya and yup oh to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves lah like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
um doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my err using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school uh we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs lah like you have to make err you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically err and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking um
because I I cause why I choose that course is um I I I want to learn how to uh bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
um pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun lah to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
oh um okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot um okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made um I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great um
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made err the pizza it um and we also make cakes um black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could err redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if ah even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like uh you have to cut it into threes uh three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and err after err the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling err at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
oh okay I remember um we didn't make okay err I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is pate choux in french and then you know uh we had to do eclaire choux so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like uh cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my err my class advisor though
um my sir showed us uh a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who uh they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed lah like they have really nice talents to um which I can also learn from them
ya
oh my lecturer name my err we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really err sir jeremy is a very nice uh teacher he
the uh he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our uh parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him uh he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who err
which teacher doesn't want to see their children uh their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like err like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
um
do you mean during COVID nineteen
um I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
um this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows err appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does uh when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause uh because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example lah like um
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross lah
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know err in restaurants last time was like uh you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the um the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like um um
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
um I know wearing a mask it will it will helps um to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face lah example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to um get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen uh to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like um it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
um
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like oh ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and oh and I was oh I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya mm but it's hard to breathe sometimes and ah ya
mm I don't know lah like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
um so abu um
so how ah I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend

ya
thing
ya
ya
actually that's come a long way man she is the first nisa I know
that hung out at like ah sarah porch and like we all hang out five of us or four of us
ya she she's come a long way man she just got pissed drunk nisa
pissed drunk it used to be like err you want some ah no no it's okay thank you now it's like ah where's the cigarette yana where's your cigarette
aiyo that girl
know that day like err the staycation lah with me ah it's my birthday ah
I I I just lay down on her lap and I just started bawling
like bawling
my emotions I'm like ya I I
no babe it's not just her I think if any of us is like no longer a part of the group or even if let's say some shit happens some drama happen and one person just decide to okay
you know evaporated that's we will feel one babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen lah I mean
ya kan
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
tini
no to tini to tini so
no so it's not that um
on that day
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told tini
pizza
so sarah
no she and I and I told tini tini
um this tini and then sarah went ballistic already ah cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no tini didn't want to talk what
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause oh maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
um and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to ah she she said that
err bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could ah tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
nisa did nisa did
eh nisa did and then I I put also eh tini we miss you ah we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that what
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
I I will never do things like that
hurt
ya
ya right ya
so ya lah
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya
you know you talk about all these cliche romantic things like till till death do us part in sickness and in health and all this bullshit it's not bullshit really like it's not it just doesn't apply to a marriage or a boyfriend girlfriend and like
even even with nisa sometimes you know like ah I'm not comfortable ah talking about it like good then I'm like great nisa thank you like no I respect that

oh but then again cause I'm not keeping up with the new ones
what is it about
okay okay
okay
ya that genre is is I mean that's my favourite genre which is shonan
ya
okay
okay
ah
explode
a'ah ah
okay strength
okay
oh okay wow
I thought I thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
mm
huh then how does he talk
ha so he just hears his voice in other people's heads
so people think he's stupid
oh my god
okay okay okay
you watch two episodes
three episodes how do you watch three episodes
right oh you skip you skip the
you don't you skip the intro and ending right
huh serious ah
how many episode is it
oh you mean like each season got twenty something episodes chey
no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite gundam series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
mm
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy lah like
like you know brings us together
that's rude
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
hmm
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
ya
although it did start lah it did spur it it started my my thing for gundam so okay fine fine I give you that bandai
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay lah fun
hmm
ya
yes so how did it go
hmm
she's like tall she's so tall
hmm
right right
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
oops
huh
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore oh okay she knows eh
wow
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
mm
mm
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
oh ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
mm
ya ya ya
okay
oh ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments lah
ya
correct ya ya
ya
sassy ah
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked uh najhah about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many eh
maybe at most twenty plus lah but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as naruto and all that with like five hundred and two seasons eh three seasons eh in all that kind of
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
I guess ya lor like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area

so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly lah it supposed to be a little like teng teng teng I mean
oh yikes
it scarred you
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
um
oh
okay okay
ah
ya ya ya
it's true though
I wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like

I don't be the typical greedy people
you cannot even think of three wishes and you want so many other wishes
nevermind I don't want to know
I wish that I'm not married
I wish that
I wish that I am smart as fuck
so that I don't need to study for my exams
and then I wish that the cat
can clean up after their
after themselves
like after they poo they will scoop up the poo and throw it in the dustbin
and done
that's my three wishes

no
that can be your three wishes what
what superpower
it's your wish why would you ask me what superpower I want

what the cat's minds
oh
oh no yesterday aman and I were at vivo there we saw this shop called face resizer then you can do that ah
you need to resize the face
collect money collect money hooray
okay you need hundred sessions
unlimited sessions
mm
my superpower is to control the cat
like for example they pee or poo I will I will tell them go and clean up
ya that's controlling the behaviour
same what control is demand
no my poor babies no way
K my superpower is
or rather the superpower that I want is to be able to read without feeling tired
noob sia we will make horrible superheroes seh
err
err I cannot
what
teleport
with a snap
I think so
err
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
ee
why
no I I don't think buttercup will want to be with you
you smack it
like how you smack alias
ya pad thai
pad thai from magic wok
ee want to go and eat the nuts
mm
good looks or a fit body
for your partner
I don't have both
hmm
okay so good looks ah
K good looks
ya lah I want to ask now lah so choose first
good looks or fit body
K
good looks or personality
then
ya lah something like etol lah you cannot say that he has good looks what
siala
I told you I didn't want that
I told you what
there's a possibility that
um
mm
mm
I would prefer
oh okay okay uh good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K lah I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
the distance between each eyes is like right
you can wear mask what
okay err
the the ugly ah
why
hello I'm with one
I rather be with an ugly one
then with someone who stinks like shit like aman
okay err
mm
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
err
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay lah one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
huh
huh
I don't understand
mm
mm I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no lah in singapore first lah
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya lah what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and uh basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya lah with the money then I will do that lah
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills what and then the cats I rescue them and then what feed them what
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya lah
cause I will invest also what so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
huh
uh uh I cannot lah
volunteer ah
then you get to play with the cats sia so cute
bring lah
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya sia like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
eh then nevermind lah they can be bubbles and more what
why socks
no but it doesn't fit
the kind of names that you want
blossom
what do you mean brighter cat

bright cats you can't even see them

ya lah that's the plan lah but we need to sit down and talk again lah cause also budget lah budget we of course to do video like this must have you know err
well okay lah at least moving lah you know cause we were we were stuck ah cause of the circuit breaker ah cause we were already in the process already
mixing during before circuit breaker like really
uh most likely will be wan G lah
in-house ah better ah cause he cause he understands the song or if not we try to
I mean like me hanis akid sit we sat down and talk we we say maybe we can call zaki lah zaki ex-member pe so at least he kind of have the same feel of the band lah ah but see how ah if he is interested ah if not then we get wan G lah you know at least so I mean zaki left the band
zaki freelance ah

we try to go as classic as possible
but okay lah at least we tried ah
cause I don't know ah I want to release this fast lah this year I want to try to release all the best ambling with lah
err yes
ya that's why
that's why
I think he he he manages to save some before that then at least during going to the phase of the wedding he doesn't really struggle lor
like struggle so much lor if not wah walao eh if you always like you push away everything right then you just want to focus on that marriage marriage or wedding ah
it's a wedding
yes
correct is focusing on the wedding instead of you focus on the marriage cause if you don't know leh like you spend so much so much on
one day and then you struggle for so many months for that one day ah walao eh
money in your then
then plan plan plan plan plan after five years can sell you upgrade ah
ah actually true
very small sia
err true same cause three resale three room bigger sia
like you more spacious old lah old a bit but then at least spacious you got space you can like
err true
wal house small err mamat house also quite small
same same as wal house yes same
err
but also ya lah I think
zafran house big
correct earlier that one big his house big like other other people house like all very small ah like hud house also actually quite small eh
correct correct correct yadi house more cramp lah
cause I think he put a lot of things inside but I don't know lah but I don't know come back to sial
hopefully you guys get to tour lah next year at least next year lah
cause I think their wedding is september eh
kan
who
this october
wow
wow ya ya it's about time lah she also needs to settle down lah
ah she is I think she's good at managing time also ah ah I think she very disciplined ya but that's good lah at least she want to get married lah
ya at sofitel kan
part-time part-time cause I got see her on instagram then I ask where she working now ah then she say
where she get job lah cause I think she got laid off at the previous place ah
ya outram or tanjong pagar that one then after that then she say she get another job lah but good for her lah at least she but she knows how to manage lah she she say actually good with time and management lah that's why she can handle the
the rental that's the good part ah
so in a way he bo pian ah he come down ah
I mean just their style lah so so he bo pian ah he bo pian he like err so I text him like eh you jamming ah huh
ya true
oh beat a
okay lah but at least you guys went tour already sia
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
musically very strong ah
ya
ah
ah that's good
those dark waves
with little cost ah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
ya
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours eh is also to me an opener ah it's still fun ah it's still fun ah I mean as following tour ah so
yes
ya lah
but then again also I think it's not also about touring ah I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring ah you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe ah then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
ya so
mm mm
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
that's why
scared sia
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person ah
but ah lal recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs ah one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas lah lyric lyric wise would be dol lah cause his lyrics are actually very good
hakim fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
ah skate punk like a lot of
hakim is very propagandhi
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part ah
confirm blast kan
oh oh farhan eh
but but
ah ya
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel lah you can also hear that is double ah like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
right
I don't know ah is their style ah
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song ah that kind of vibe ah but then
ah ya ya
ya relevant bands ah
they they they they suck life ah or they suck ah actually personally I don't listen to them already ah like rarely listen to them
penny wise will still be that sound ah cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
err still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album what
last year ah not bad lah but still the same sound ah
I like penny wise but I still prefer
ya ah professor professor sia vocalist professor siol sia
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene ah they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like err surfers and skateboarders mah
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets ah but they are very intelligent people ah
tony hawk pro skater eh
no I don't like him ah
but cannot ah
but okay lah see how lah missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause wan G got a new bass
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
ah I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape one then he just need to redo the everything ah so he give to hakim hakim
maggot maggot ah maggot setting up for him ah then he gonna after that we jam ah
composer
all of us ah together but wan G is the one that do everything lah so
yes err so we input ideas lah ah like but but wan G will will wan G will do first lah at home then after that after he do
I don't know he ah to me it's okay lah
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something lah and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said eh
err better ah
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound eh I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
do it fast ah cause we delay too long already ah ah so we we we say never mind lah we we we told hakim next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you ah but because we already comfortable eh and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff lah
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like ah ah recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
ah bass man ah it I think is
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky ah I think I think he's damn lucky ah like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
good sounds for the band lah
so far his recordings are actually good ah his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good ah for me lah personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient yadi is lah
cause must commit correct must commit
cause hakim is very hardworking that is his his income pe his livelihood pe
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands lah but from what
sia
no no no he he got another reggae band
err
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer ah ya ya ya rizal
so I think recorded there also
err even stoned revivals ah remix sound that song oh no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it err make it into malay also err I think goodil eh
ya lah but how they do it right is like err err
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia esam esam australia esam will record
err we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here ah
ya but it also depends on him what he I don't know but
don't know ah but
I I don't know ah but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay lah I think zad also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good ah
youtube siao he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out ah into it ah
yes correct
but then see lah maybe maybe in future lah maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest ah but one thing about zad I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good sia cause he feels paiseh lah want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use lah I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks lah cause it's a wear and tear
ah
that's why
of course
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable what it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay lah I mean I understand
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
ah we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him lah if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever lah run everything if ah confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury lah so then
at least you know before to record we come here lah we help you to shift the whatever lah amp
ya shift the mic lah whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential sia
you're the
go to in a way go to guy you know
err cause of what you produce ah
so we'll see lah
don't know lah
I know he he some more him being very anxious guy
err so he needs to get out
he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya lah
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right zad was okay zad wanted to do it he injured what
ah
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental ah mental ah it's it is more of mental
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend what then then we just walk ah so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to punggol end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk ah
ah but azil also said never mind ah we take it slow ah don't don't
don't force yourself lah you know then to give up also now is like wasted sia ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself ah
twenty minutes half an hour after that aisyah like okay ah then we all like come lah let's go ah hafiz waiting
ah ah
so we had to walk for one plus click ah
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
so that was the slowest walk to punggol err settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
ah
siao
ah ah
oh there the park connector ah
go to coastal
east coast
it's wrong coastal the coastal tanah merah coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
ya so ya lah but don't know ah but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard ah
so ya lah but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
whatever we can cut we cut ah no lah but
yio chu kang sengkang cannot ah must go that way no actually right
oh cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the buangkok is the nearest to reach ah but that one is also quite a stretch ah
ah ah but but is like you walk walk eh park connector park connector then you see eh sengkang already
the other end then you go in front another bridge oh that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of sengkang
then you go to punggol so that from punggol the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay ah this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just sumang
so that sumang is the end the beginning of that sumang is like the end middle of punggol lah that sumang
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
so there's another route ah so there's another route to walk
but we see lah we try again ah
we see next time maybe end of the year lah okay lah K K K

ya
ya
yes
what
yes
very small
hmm this is small already
mmhmm
mm
mm
ya
mm
is this
there's less demand hence there's
no
well less demand equates to higher price lah because there's
no more saturation of market
for there to be a
mm
ya
I think I think lah they will start to downgrade the price but it's not
decrease they will decrease the price but it won't be soon
mm

ya your female friend that one
something like curry or stew or something
mm
mm
mm
you will considered it
for yourself
then there will be two rooms and so you rent out the whole thing
mm
mmhmm
mm yes

okay
mm
what type of superpower I want ah
because err even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
um
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
um ya it's not a
err
err to fight crime
like
err and they don't just fight
err those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
uh
uh
mm
mm
bat batman or iron man
uh
mm
specific
ability is to fly
mm
mm
powers
doctor strange mm
uh
oh
mm
orh
mm
mm
ah
ya hogwart that one ah
ah
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
mm
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation ah
teleportation boring ah
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train kan you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
mm
mm
okay
mm
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
mm
um
mmhmm
mm but people need what
okay when you are rich you might not feel that oh money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million lah not not like that lah
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
mm
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
err
let them err
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
mm
it's a
power
ah
ah where you can give to people
uh huh
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
mm
but how
I think that one is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
mm
mm
mm
mm
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that err no need to work lah
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that eh why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
mm
mm
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe err
err
err superman is boring lah or maybe the flash
or
mm
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
uh
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
uh superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
mm mm
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
mmhmm
ah
okay next
no no that one they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one lah who will fight
wonder woman
err something like that lah the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
err letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once mah
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple uh
ya right
ya
apple apple lah the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
uh
they'll new movies will go into
that one produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
ah
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
ah that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
uh this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money lah it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and err upgrade their
account
from one person only
mm
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount mah to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward eh you
mm
mm
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
mm
mm
uh
orh
orh
okay
mm
superpower
mm
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
ah ya lah what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
mm
mm
ah
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people

thor has a lot of flaws
thor has a lot of flaws
he can't be the king of his own
people
ah ya lah
that that is flaw lah
and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws
mm

on
err
the sound that involves in each movie
might not
come out with
the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal
so they are the the problem is that sound that's coming out of the
might not be the same setting
might be differ from house to house lah maybe that's the only problem lah
ah
you know
surround system

ya
cause they cannot handle high volume everyone the whole of singapore come at the same place at the same time they cannot handle ya

who we have to look up to I thought that you say that mummies are also superheroes
so these are all superheroes that are in are in actual real life also
but but when we're talking about superheroes we can talk about anything
ya lah ya lah this is what people should do
ya
to be superhero in our life
ya lah
mm

hi hamzah
uh no contract ah
um ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but I think minus fifty because got voucher
um
every month
pay fifty five so it's almost double ah
okay bottom western epitope so calculate um mahjong
what okay two years eh so it's two years times fifty five dollars
times twenty four months kan about extra seven hundred dollars ah kan
but iphone eleven uh how much ah iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one lah I think thirty two
okay
um
ya I check a bit the difference is about the incoming I think free eh same ah same um
twenty I think
I think
maybe less than ten ah maybe seven also
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
um ya lah almost four years ah
ah that's why
ah sorry again
oh but but that time kan that time I pergi tu apa um challenger kan iphone seven
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars I think seven ah but seven also like
also present lobang ah no haunted
ah no contract
but
no but
oh oh K then
oh
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
mm
but
ya but now starhub plan ah the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone X
no what are they doing
ya
oh
oh then uh how how's your job search
then um
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now eh all the interview ah
the developer they eh you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
this kind of coding test kan
oh
the the you must type the code inside
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
mm
okay
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
ah I think they really keep calling you know
it's like
very pushy ah so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
ah what is the maximum lah the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm ah kan because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit ah pointless kan
so like
ah I forgot the word lowball ah something like lowball ah
no no value ah kan
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
it's not permanent ah but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
be eager to you know um ya
join the company like this
ah mostly
so tuition
but ya that's why
so that time middle of october kan so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months ah kan so actually
I think one or two weeks before ah two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right ah so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest ah maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same ah one week difference I think
the normal tech
huh
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group ah then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better lah until october
data entry lah you know those
just typing on excel kan basic ah
ah office ah and typing or sending email those basic admin work ah
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description kan is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said um they said okay monday to friday the timing is um I think
about five to ten ah or four to ten like five hours ah or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
um for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply um sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear ah
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer ah so
like but mostly mostly also must support ah because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support kan
so phone support is a bit too much ah you know
ah that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable kan it's a it's it's python programming considered high level kan
uh they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
mm
it's called ah fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
ah C sharp
huh golac
G G O L A C eh
oh golang
mm
okay then
because
building kan
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these ah data and then maybe
a bit of support ah the support kind of role ah
because like for me last time I work in a bank kan
twenty nineteen ah twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
kan
that time I work in a bank kan so
so um laymans kan the back end ah so
you know logs kan you know logs
L O G S ah log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out lah
then investigate maybe or something
um the front part is a investigation ah
but the it's like ticket ah like they say what
support and ticket and then
uh raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close ah
then last what you call that analyse ah whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite um interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called uh run the bank ah not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means um
it means that the the app is ongoing ah you understand like it's not a project ah that means the project already finish that means it's live ah live product being used by users ah
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china uh all this so the timezone all weird weird one
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us what
ya then their working hours until our six what so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues what I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic eh
ah nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven ah because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead what only lah then just wake up what that time
because there's two countries new york eh no two states
new york and where ah san francisco right ah
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server ah
I don't think so ah or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank ah our local bank so ya the business not so much ah
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this ah this basic functions ah kan
oh they call it the green eh green lane eh
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that what
they can come
ah they they can say ah ya they can use the fact that their house right at clementi need to do something ah right collect the mail the mailbox ah because
um
but the the tenant kan you know the eh now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail ah
who
okay
cousins uh
they I think busy also ah
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight ah
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
huh
mm
so there's money
it's not in the fridge eh
oh
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the eh fry the fish first right
I think the it ah the the the preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife ah hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid ah
but it's it's good if you have a maid ah but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house kan so one maid right um share our woodlands house
they maybe my future house or your future house ah so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else ah like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first ah
hmm
ya
no but I think
internally kan if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off ah right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal ah because um as long the maid
huh
normally the maid off sunday kan one day off kan
ya
but I think they're a bit
eh
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map kan is fixed ah
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual ah
ya then if the stock finish
oh wah cool ah
so call move ah
I think no but
I think I think ah Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental ah
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface ah the mapping kan the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue ah kan
but they they can they will monitor your work ah
oh ya ah standard meeting ah kan
oh last time that time zoom you all also use zoom ah
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people kan during the COVID
really ah
huh they going to open here ah
ya but singapore smart ah I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues ah
oh good ah ah are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not ah now
ya
oh open already ah I don't know ah
half ah
I think half of that
eh I think because I think
susah nak apa kita
ah predict the people kan because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
oh actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those um
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what ah counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot ah like last time I went I went exchange also same ah I I
because most people will eat solo ah because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person ah then you face the you face nobody ah like you know face like a the wall or something ah so it's like against the wall kan
ah actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
serangoon garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor lah you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting ah like like al-ameen at our place the the woodgrove kan
ya open concept ah like is is like sheltered lah
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person ah then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side tau that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you ah or three of you kan will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing ah but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then ah section off like one table instead of six right become four lah you know
I mean they can do that lah but I think
maybe today they change lah because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news ah then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner ah for because actually right like very strict ah I mean eh it's it's not the kan
uh eh it's so they are very strict ah
so
I think some of the
kan complain ah like oh call police ah I don't know what they call ah they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually oh at first maybe they ask them to go out lah say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search ah you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy kan
ya I think maybe like they have a counter lah like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't ah what you call that scan out ah checkout from the place
huh
ah trace together kan
oh that one
oh because of bluetooth ah
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
oh
so like between ah android and they also know what to do right
ya
um
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google ah kan
I don't know ah because like maybe I want to try Google ah but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air kan
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini eh
you can play um I mean you can play the eh what's it called ah the radio station like singapore radio station
ah live streaming ah as long you got wifi lah
so actually from the wifi eh but actually dangerous oh I realise kan they recognise our voice oh
the google home speaker ah I mean the I mean google home ah
because right that time kan my friend kan
so
I ask google ah using my voice ah like when is my birthday or what is my age ah something
then they know ah cause I think like google gmail ah all this something
so like they know uh something like my birthday or my name ah
then because my friend got google phone right
oh there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker ah the google home speaker kan then he ask um like what is my name or something ah
then the google know that it's him then say his name
ah or birthday ah ah I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess what
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person what
ah so a bit scary lah I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community kan instagram or something kan
but if the wifi off kan but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device kan
so will it still listen
um connect you
to the
but default ah but if you ask like questions like um
ah offline what do you call it offline data ah
what basic basic functions ah kan
ya
it's good ah
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon what a lot so
I think because they also got money ah so their apartment like one room one bedroom ah so like those studio ah
got how many version ah I also don't know ah
smart home device ah
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven kan like is there a brand for smart oven now
oh
oh
got smart shower or not I don't know
oh but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there lah because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen ah I don't know
or voice ah
eh but that means right COVID better what if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene kan then I think maybe future ah singapore the lift also maybe smart kan
or lift system
I think can make right
oh the base I mean there's a pedal kan
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working ah so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens kan too many screen one is left one is right kan
because you card is only one level ah

sorry ah why why what happened
okay which man U game was that mm
oh I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david moyes you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when thiago was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
ah
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games ah
am I right okay never mind err who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch tau it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw thiago go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
mm
okay
uh huh
that philosophy ah
okay
the same louis van gaal were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
mmhmm
okay
ya
okay
mmhmm
okay
I see
okay
wow
so he's like the empty football guy
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay that's that's the same school ah
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
mm mm
just whack ah basically ah
a'ah
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya
klopp denies you space mourinho mourinho gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with ah but ah okay lah I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean wow wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the team from the start ah eh how's your by the way
sial ah for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer ah
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years ah actually I can play on my iPad also kan
err I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically err ah I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
err so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated err Netflix show
okay but anyway err
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix lah cause
what happened was uh when september now eh so last month err
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
err I was like okay lah feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
hey there's this anelka documentary on Netflix
ah have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this anelka documentary ah so so it's uh it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause err
raymond dominic actually like uh had a an argument with anelka
I got into Netflix cause of that anelka documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows lah but some like err okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai ah
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like oh they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation ah
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
uh am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like oh you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting lah like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it lah so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and err it's about how this guy err I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder err ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you lah but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town lah that he's in
ah it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean ah okay lah so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places ah one is err knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america uh
err K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so ah basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is err you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that lah
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so uh and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then err and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story err
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted ah I mean in the movie they they they
ah not not just inner demons ah I mean they are just they are evil people ah you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is ah robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something kan
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but eh but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show ah
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie ah
ah well he doesn't he doesn't molest children ah
a'ah
okay
are you sure you want to say this on err are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box ah
oh is it
so basically it's an lah
okay okay
ah
oh is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya lah they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five ah it's like not not even ah
ya ya
mm mm
mm
ya
mm mm
ah ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl kan
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
mm
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that uh they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no lah
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's uh not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
err groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans lah
because of this ah so
so I mean like in singapore dee kosh obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
a'ah
okay
ah
okay
alright
oh my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through ah
okay
ah
okay
he's he's a good kid ah
okay
a'ah ah ah
ah ah
okay
oh okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him oh you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya lah cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that upskirtism
so he actually did it
look eh look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates ah bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name ah but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes ah
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him lah like I I remember of
his existence back this in ah
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally lah cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know ah maybe we're we're looking at it differently lah maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation ah from what I understand lah
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum ah
sorry syed ahmad we didn't mean to mention your name
oh okay
oh okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
ah we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time ah
a'ah
ah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
ya
okay
mm mm
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way ah perhaps ah
a'ah
ah
mm
ya
mm
ya
well I mean what can you say ah these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on ah
and I guess people are just
following trends ah just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common ah you know nowadays you have mosque
ya lah but you still had your your function in a activity hall ah my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
err I mean there there are some huh
err subject to any of these trends I feel lah
you can lah you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
ah
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that ah you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house lah I don't know whether I told you
bro sengkang bro raeesah khan
oh sorry was that too loud jamus lim
err unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not sengkang but it's okay
no no this is ang mo kio so
ah sorry ah every conversation between zulika and myself must involve some degree of politics lah then you know there's some spice ah
so uh we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come uh we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good ah ah
I I don't want to play games ah I mean I think I would draw the line at games ah
ya
my wife my wife and I oh but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife ah okay
a'ah
okay
wah
that's a very productive err your time bro
oh okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad eh you you should talk
oh my god okay
ya lah he hasn't changed his name yet lah
okay
yes yes yes yes
uh
okay
ah
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see oh ya ya ya ya ya
err so I think his brother died or something eh
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them ah okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago sia
okay
huh
I I've never watch game of thrones ah by the way
of course ah bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
oh okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me ah no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true ah
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it oh ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
oh my god I I thought this was over sia bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
ah
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
a'ah
sial lah bro you could have read all the books seh in all that time sia bro
oh I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that err I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently lah so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys lah so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
hey siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
ah all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful lah I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
a'ah
uh huh
it automatically scans the code oh okay
it goes in a anti clockwise eh clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
eh so so so err we're coming to the end
okay
oh I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
ah both ah
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
but I mean it's a bit late for for prata simpang bedok ah
you don't know mahamoodiya

I was looking through our the booking right
ya okay
because the one that I found was
the same place because
okay err
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus ah below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think only four lah right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so err
but I'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the uh call um membership
so he got discount lah
ya
that one is sofitel is at tanjong pagar
very near what the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around there's a lot of cafes there also what
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there lah
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon lor
yup
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya lor
ya oh ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week lah I see how lor technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya oh ya last year we had the what
ya no but whenever tanjong pagar theme
don't know
I don't know lah maybe theme
oh ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
ya
oh really ah
from which err supermarket
ya
sheng siong sheng siong also hard sia
I mean you see my area around down here there's no sheng siong the nearest is bukit panjang mall
giant lah since we just with brandon
eh last year we did giant
aiya
eh ya ya
so what
ya I remember the cause I think got more things to buy
mm
who's the free one ah
can you plan
please
you have to be codes
this is not chinese new year
dinner
but now buffet very irritating ah
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
mm
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
oh ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
oh ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
okay
oh ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that lah they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
ya
different timing
ya
can
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely lah I mean you cannot meet lah but
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
oh ya just five of us lah
without partners lor
mm
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us what
korean ya that ah
farin birthday
oh
oh yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners lor that
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya okay
ya
um
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work lah
ya
mm
ya lor
monday right
is it really
ya
oh
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
hais
okay lor we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
then he say it's like seven hundred oh my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred sia
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
you are in a cold room
whoa but luckily I went taiwan sia just before lockdown
ya
err not as good as that one we we went that time
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
hais
hais ya
ya
eh but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
um ya
but you know the that time the who say ah which minister
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably lah elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations lah wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel lah
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
was there lah oh my god
mm
err they have another issue to tackle there oh my god
mm
are you talking about succulent
oh
the normal one cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
mm
oh I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what sia cardboard
oh what
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
hais anyway I have an assignment on an essay lah so I need just err your your point of view lah I guess
mm it's about um
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
why
mm
ya
true leh ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
mm
ya
mm
good what lockdown good what I was enjoying the period
mm
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems lah rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
oh
ya
mm
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel lah like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation lah so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway err
ya lah alhamdulillah I need the money so what's the problem
to avoid this err to convert their platform store into online platform lah so
mm
true I mean you will lose your human touches also lah right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
err
I think it brings families together
kind
that's all lah like
so
ya
I know
not every family can get along lah hundred percent get along so
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one wah then
ya
right ya
mm
ya obviously
ya
mm
true
mm
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better lah because you know carbon footprints were reduced lah I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit lah of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight lah like just
ya
ya
ya
okay lah at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress lah I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit leh
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
mm
ya
maybe they did lah like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
not counsellors lah what what is it calling
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
ya
mm
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes lah but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya eh can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society lah I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case lah on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water one
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito one
it's true okay lah but that's not really a problem I guess
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down lah
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel lah at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot leh
is it
aren't we not at the top
oh we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest lah
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to lah but it's not possible lah per se
oh my god
oh that one that they kill all the animal ah but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus what ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
they have to kill all the the chickens mah
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
yes
mm
uh huh
ya inside the middle ah
uh huh
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese err ah swiss cheese plant
stop it lah
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times leh
what is a prayer plant
mm
ya
mm
but monstera is an indoor plant what right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
mm
ya
ya
technically they are bushes lah weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
not really leh
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt leh
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer lah but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
err the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk leh like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also what light can ah
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
can ah
ya probably can lah I don't know
I don't know it just grows short lah from small to big lah I guess shoots ya
hais
no oh my god that one
no meh
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
ah
mm
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office uh condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
aiya very the
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
aiya you don't know one lah
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
mm oh my god
mm
hais
mm
spray is it then
mm
ah
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
mm
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also what if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
mm
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
mm ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die sia
hmm
oh my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough lah too much plants ah mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in

cook right
you didn't have to take home econs as a subject no eh for us it was compulsory everyone had to take home econs D&T

tchoukball or something is it the one you throw them net they had through at the net
I don't remember floorball tchoukball I don't remember ya I mean we did play uh captain's ball a lot I was always the goalkeeper
cause I was great at catching balls I was good at no pun intended but ya ya ya I played a lot frisbee uh I played basketball in secondary school then rugby was like my final like touch rugby was my final
we learn
okay lah
that's why in like you know secondary school I was so fit then the moment I went to poly I gained so much weight because I didn't do the same amount of physical activity I was eating I was still having like unhealthy lifestyle I slept like like irregular eat irregularly also ya it's okay now I can tell people I tried a lot of things that's why I tell people what I'm a jack of all trades master of none
but ya I think primary school and secondary school there's a lot of like ghost stories sia ya especially you know you go to camps
do you do you have any camps like do you guys have any like
ha okay you continue
oo
mm
we loved it
yes
is it that's not really horror though more of thriller right it's the it's the kid who pretended to it's the adult who pretended to be a kid right because she had some disorder right
oh
oh shit
ah
it's it's like haunted house lah kan it's like it's like during our camp lah kan
yikes
faci faci
he stare at you no I mean for me my night walk I mean I had a I had like camps lah primary school
what is it ah
one of the the the the guys right one of the army one of the army stories
no not the not the one that the guy died with the the not with the intestines all over the floor one it's the other one is the the one that he offended the offerings or something then
ya because he mummy boy ya that place lah the that that place they used as like the no it was at a camp I don't remember but I think it's now closed is it sarimbun is sarimbun closed I don't remember it was I think sarimbun because I remember sleeping on those bunks
ya but ya when I had those night walks right it was
okay because night walks right what they did was that the line the route with glow sticks tau
they line the route with glow sticks then the
the like you are free to walk ah
it started out fine but right it's like
like when how say eh uh
it started out fine but it's like err when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
everyone was showered
everyone finished showering already
kan if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
creeped the heck out of me
aik
mm
yikes
they just stayed there lah so bad in everything smelt then the house smelt
no they say that
LOL
uh huh cause I watched that one
mmhmm
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess err I don't know lah I mean allahu alam ah eh
that's why I say I don't know you go Google lah I don't know what else ah
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
people correct
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
no it's
islam
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean uh you hear stories that sometimes inside the
mm they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right eh no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it lah
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so mm I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
mm
mm
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also what they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while uh psychological study said that oh it's just like uh was it what seh
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
like you said what they can uh what is it ah they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night lah around four
what
no shit oh hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby oh my god ha
mm that's why ah
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the uh door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia lah you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
I think oh I don't know I do know there some bomohs in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise ah
mm
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff lah but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay lah it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya oh because it will like corrode or something is it oh ya ya
okay
but ya
I don't know some
ah ya something like that I'm not sure
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
but this ya
err accord sort is it they show you stuff
like and stays forever
ya boy
mmhmm
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
ha
I don't know I mean depends on the family uh because you are unless
you not supposed to say this lah but unless the
pass to you
no lah what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
ya I think so it's an agreement lah basically you are agreeing what if you nod it's a form of agreement what no matter
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
how to say eh
I
lame okay and my mum said lah my mum said lah eh she said that the thing picks a master that is like
for real

it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot ah too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
uh how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but uh
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the not contemporary ah english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
uh uh lah okay lah then I I have to agree with you lah we go we put the partition that means
eh ya lah correct lah when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like um
ah like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
chey private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt lah all that lah so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny ah
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like uh
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
mm
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
uh mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
uh or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
mm
eh but the other day I went through um this hard zone or something lah the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across uh this person
uh he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else lah then it's already two K
just the platform
mm
I put uh under
uh extra budget column
in the planning lah so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then ah the service balcony you know the
the doorway um between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills uh window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it what so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay ah
mm
actually not bad leh you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that uh different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
wah I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
uh came to real life you know really eh so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like uh extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this one is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
ah
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else oh ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
err like the window grill I don't know
so but then that one I haven't research uh
but uh ya
I think I think it's because ah it's already old lah that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not what it's supposed to be tight what like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the uh the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this one capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical uh wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya lah that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia lah because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
uh recipients
eh but eh but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back yay belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house ah you watch the host ah hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
eh but the new season uh the other day I was uh randomly uh looking for right
and then I saw uh one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
um the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was ah what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this one this time round is this company aiya I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually uh watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this ah if not actually uh three D innovation is good leh
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
uh what do you call that low income families eh
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them ah because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget lah maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what ah you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper lah okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back uh
oh we didn't even say anything but he himself say that uh we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years eh the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the uh what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that one
uh wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman seh to install our this one the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only lah that one okay lah but even so uh remember the
the also not proper
hollow eh
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask what we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
uh and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to hafari right
then ah then after that mm
either that or he know that he never do correctly lah he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable what right because ya it's a expensive tile
mm
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope lah we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet uh already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know uh like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the uh is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that one will reduce the cost ah cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist uh off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have ah that one already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
ah
ah package ya two standard
mm
mm
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
oh double
ah
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if uh whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same uh the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need uh
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own uh contractor for the vinyl right
ah when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
ah
ya it is the newest click function that one right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own one but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
ha
ah
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in uh kids room
oh
ya
eh mm
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company uh he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give what remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
mm
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that one cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know uh overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that one also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is uh I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean eh you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
hmm
vinyl
mm
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this one remember this one got two option we this one is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move one without lesser groove
ya
maybe that one cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser ah grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
mm
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop uh water sucking mop what
that one that one you won't go into the groove
ya lah it suck water the mop suck water right
ah
okay water absorbing mop
oh
oh that one
that one very expensive that one is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but ah make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous eh that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old uh oh now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M one but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
huh difficult have what
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home one you go and find no
only that brush sial no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
ah
okay so uh actually oh I forgot to tell you I uh I sign up through Renopedia
and then um through there there will be contacting me ah like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even uh ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection lah so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us lah through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia what right
so is all go back to our own research ah
actually they say um doesn't mean the very the company eh very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the uh company but I must also research uh and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
ah hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then uh also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then err
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go uh down and uh have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give lah
ya uh but I haven't show you then I I even I even uh wrote down their names the
uh
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
oh ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down what
mm
it must be a balance ah we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
ah to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

how I know
let's hope
I know I know I know
like
I have one next week oh my god I've just realized I have two next month also
but then because at that time I think the wedding rules were still like
like
to the same person
ya
apparently if you do your wedding under the void deck now you only get two hours
ya two hours so she's like but no forget it
ya that's why she changed her mind lah so she did it at home
singapore flyer
really
she's only doing it cause her mother and father there
I think if I ever do get married
I want like I don't want a big wedding either but
let's say let's say hypothetically speaking ah
there is no way in hell that man will want a small wedding
ya because he has people like
overseas it's not just people here leh
really man my ex wanted a fucking big wedding sia and I'm like
I don't understand how some girls can have like twelve bridesmaids
I don't even have twelve friends
don't know what corporate bridesmaid keeper ran to like how are you even forking out money for like of people too right
right
kan
like how how do you even have twelve friends who are
supposingly like ya
like how I don't understand sial like I think about it ah I only got five friends I can count on and that's it the numbers stops there it doesn't grow I don't want new friends I don't care for it
speaking about friend
speaking about friends so did she talk to you again
I cannot be bothered she ah messaged me and she said uh
I cannot
ya
really

oh my god do you remember jamie
he texted me
he texted me twice this month
one asking me how I was lah this and that and then he said sorry that like
he never like remain in contact and that it was his fault and I'm like nah it's all good
I just said nah it's all good
then he asked me oh can you ask your friend if he can help us get the
private area at rumours for a birthday party I need it for a friend I'm like
err no guarantees but sure
ya
kan
he just has to book what
ya he can just book and it's not even that like now you want to book also it's not going to be as fun as that time
cause there are so much more stricter there are so much more stricter now
we went before like all that shit went down lah we went before the
the social distancing people even went there
ya
ee
I I think babe it's in july it was in july
start already lah but they were still like not very serious about the rules there
by six you have to pack up and leave you cannot stay later than six and then all the beach clubs close at like eight o'clock now apparently
ya so we got very lucky
kan
you lah busy
okay what's the date
but
it's like
mm
huh
ah
we can
we can do twelve
ya twenty six too far cannot twelfth is perfect
ya twelve is perfect
I don't even know how you broke your phone that day you know I really don't
I wasn't even drunk that day I just don't get how you oh I think I know when
when you was getting at andre's lobby and you fell remember
your phone didn't fold in half lah the screen just crack lah
try we I should just wait so you mean she at home you get ahead you they they can repair or ability or or go with their iphone or cold air cool white apron sky then err I don't know last night eh I really don't know eh you give exists food opposite the airport who got a C is you know what
I don't know
I really don't know how you broke your phone I cannot like to this day sometimes I really like think about it tau I retraced you know like every single thing we did that day
not once did we see your phone come out eh
huh
you're not that troublesome to me ah
all you had was one glass sial
wake boarding
you know my swimming skills are so terrible
my swimming skills a very terrible
I will still be able to drown trust me
I think so ah you know when I went to phuket right then I wanted to go snorkeling very badly because I really like the sea I love the beach I love the sea I like being in water but cannot swim for nuts I can only swim if my feet can touch the ground serious then we went to I went to phuket right with my ex ah then
we book all snorkeling trip know going to island island hopping right so we went to like maya bay and all that then the first island was in the middle of the freaking sea leh
cry lah damn sad sia then andre tried to teach me swimming in his pool
I cannot take it why do you have hiccups now
are we allowed to like pause the recording
probably
eh I want to henna dye my brows also leh
I lazy sial want to draw
syed's gonna what
why
ya
mm
he don't know how to find job is it
huh
oh
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
mm
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment eh where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
wah I'll be great and that sia andre sure sia will be good at that
he always he always huh
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
wah snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
mmhmm I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
huh
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
he doesn't I mean he will cook lah once in a while but lately we've been buying err he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from sia he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him lah whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
oh so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick ah just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know ah it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like oh he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making eh like it's pointless like I told andre because uh last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle lah so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me lah but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices what anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be sia so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise ah
mm
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
syed better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar what and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself lah like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose lah but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve sia
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like oh um
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
mm same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there lah
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already what tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper joo chiat
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one what so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts ah but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see ah I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you ah
he eat but he's still white
so like white people kan standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
oh my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one what I mean if you are near the area then ya lah if not it'll be very troublesome for you what
wow I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope ah out of curiosity
when is syed's birthday
january what
oh my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini lah but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs what your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
wah
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them one know in like the last message I got was that ah oh it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
hmm
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
aiyo
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out

hais when can we travel ah
uh exact date I'm not sure but I know it's
february um coincides I think with chinese new year
yes
so when is chinese new year
I don't know leh
no I think should be
I think err mid eh
should be mid right
ya I think so
who who getting married
but all in like um
you shouldn't have made that statement
yes I'm from griffiths primary school
come on
ah I don't
maybe if I see the face I can somehow recall lah but
seems familiar
from griffiths primary ah thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
mm okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya lah griffiths uh primary is the one next to my place ah
ah
no no ya now renamed to angsana
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
angsana griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
maybe like past years like
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
ah speaking of which
ah
ah
then err
ya
okay lah
ya
so anyway like that ah so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
oh how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
woohoo
wah
so the kid
but he's not present lah for that two months or he's still orh
orh
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer lah in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better lah because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but ya
ya
mm
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
uh ya
oh
ah
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate uh like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the the principals ah
ya uh head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
ya
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know lah what they do
you know settle some like don't know lah some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching eh
ya
I think like can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
orh ah
I think err
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like eh I mean my previous school lah
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
ah
ah
mm mm
mm mm
so so what's the ranking actually for for early childhood like
like
teacher
mm
so I mean like there's
wow so deep sia
where you at what you at what you're at now
yes
ah
okay
ah ah
so priority according to priority
okay name me three
aww
inshallah
okay
no
so it's like practically
so
ya
mm
I think so I do not know maybe
no ah no
ya
ya why I look different
ya lah it has always been this ya but um
ya
but um
something that I need to tell you about this spectacle
no I didn't buy specs I buy something cheaper I buy super glue
so after that ya ya but eh I think is that one is reading glasses maybe
ya
eh it has this listing eh it will stick
orh
orh
orh
then then
hmm
eh that's the functional light right
you buy that all the way from
so the switch is there ah the one
ya
okay what nice what so when you sleep you will switch on that light
orh
ya ya ya I know
I know I sleep with you
huh
ah
huh
wait
orh yes yes yes
oh my god one
on a working day
then what time you woke up just now
then you should feel like
when you're surely
so you know they do it lah now
ya
ya
cause somehow when you're in that situation you know you have to do it you do it right
yes
orh
but because I think you got a lot of things already is it sometimes is the
orh
okay lah ya lah
but uni
ya
because that time I think uh
whether like um like
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya lah
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
ya
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think err central port
it's err geylang geylang
I think ah I think I may be wrong but I guess that's the location
ya maybe it's there or around the area
but I think it should be
east side
because he stays in the east
ya
east coast plan what east coast plan
ya
I think I think bedok area
eh
ya
mm mm
ya I was like aww
ya
orh
mm no no
ya this one is I think yesterday's story he was just like showing
ya around
I mean it's different lah different vibes lah chey

ah
ya

hi
my name is Intan and this is weird
later on like the when the government give like the government um announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give uh you
okay well
well as you know lah kan I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January um there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report uh Singapore reported their first case
like we didn't care so err after that when err Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but err my my boyfriend was like the most kiasu of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most kiasu and he was very irritating
and then is like he just insist ah right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know Tokyo is near
Yokohama no is it is it near I mean like err there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in Tokyo lah so
err we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like err luckily we came back right before when err Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other and um and whatever
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
so I can balance I can juggle my life with err studies I can keep my time occupied eh and like you know just do my stuff
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her lah but as in like the fact is that like stupid sia you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible
oh my god stereotype sia
that's another unwanted
then after that she was like err even at times at times we we I suggest lah okay I say nevermind lah mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked err they they featured some characters like you know um everyday Singaporeans and everything
um like I think one of them was about like uh a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to uh the needy lah basically and uh you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not err feature
food deliverer uh like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like um healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
err like you know like for example they they do a they did a feature on like the uh cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
oh really
oh it wasn't cheap
mmhmm but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
um you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like um not considered
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like err very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
eh what
but in order to in order to get
mm
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that um like
err the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading err um like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
err our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking lah like eh so how ah you think that next year ah no sorry next sem which is like in a month um
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
so so um
err we we were like somehow like quite happy that uh we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then err then we we tested out the Zoom err interface then it of like sucked lah because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then err we had exams
what is that module I took I forgot oh uh it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
so basically we were stuck at home so err like the school has to think about something
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
so this open task err is like
a forty eight hour it opens like uh forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then err it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like err by one thirty on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on lah
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me ah I personally I rather do myself ah because I know I can do it
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a assignment so basically I had to do err
stuff hais like I prepared questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to lah as in like you know when I left
when I left err when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
eh thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful ah sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work lah
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and oh my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
mmhmm
ugh I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive lah I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up lah you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the err that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it lah okay like my my classmates ah my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life kan
and
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
eh
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay lah I I don't think my my err my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture uh eleven uh sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
and then huh
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time err by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that lah so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on err in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free eh uh huh
mm
no because
no no no like like periodically right periodically um err Grab host like have this like err promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer um a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then oh no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
uh the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so err ya
and then err so isn't like basically is this was this uh service available on err Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course lah because now everybody can go out already what
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know Nurul is err Nurul has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya
if Russia if Russia produced I mean if that vaccine claim by Russia is proven effective then maybe we have
we wait wait shorter lah there goes my Korea trip at the end of the year
we will see whether it works or not but ya like I said let me reiterate this point I said that I'm going to misses I'm gonna have to cancel my trip at the end of the year
how many vacations did you go on this year
I went three times okay minus the fact that I came back from Doha
ya but February we are still gooing out to Japan and then after that is like
ya
I think we went to oh ya we went we went to once in March
no no no no I can't remember when err no it wasn't it was before way before like the part
I think it was one week before Singapore said that whoever who left overseas have to go undergo like quarantine or whatever
Fernando
I know but he she he was so antsy to leave the house like whatever it takes
I swear to god but whatever is it up I think it's up
okay three more minutes of talking shit
wait
you are not young anymore you know this is not like ten years ago
this is not ten years ago already okay hello I remembered when we were it was ten years ago we we used to sit
like for hours doing nothing and doing crap on on internet
ya oh shut up
ya I'm I'm going for a class that I'm paying for so thank you very much and it's my holidays now so I'm chilling
whatever
thumbs up
I don't have a loan I didn't take a loan
I'm gonna get mine like next year and I still don't have a loan
huh how how how many years have you been working already
how many years have you been working
I won I won
I don't I don't know how many
mm

okay testing
okay lah can lah
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of um hitting the red waves
yeah
ah but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements ah
take this as a the centre marking ah
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like ah um what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but what what was the instructor's comments
mm
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money ah
it's the same bike
mm
E brake eh
oh okay okay ya ha ya it's there ah okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
mm
behind ah
oh okay
secluded ah
okay
um
of course lah
wait you went you you stop to help her
oh the instructor went to help her
ya lah I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
oh she
ya correct ya
mm
mm
what so she crashed into the wall
skid ah
by point of time you stop ah
mm
mmhmm
kill switch
mm mm mm mm mm
oh you get you got number one ah
mm
bandana
mm
mm
the other side ah
then
mm mm
mm mm
but he was in charge of your class ah
prac one also lah
oh okay
hmm
no lah maybe maybe they they want you to practise more ah before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no lah some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay lah I mean with practice you can ah
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already ha
that's how fast a class two bike is ah
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly ah
highly harly can bobber ah you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive lah sia uh I I I tested the bike um
I think last year during uh
so when they they they open up their their booth
people lah so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
whatever what you see is what you get lah
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
uh sanju
kaki bukit sanfu sanfu
uh and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven ah seventeen K
eh sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus ah
expensive ah
definitely way cheaper lah I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean uh zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike ah brixton
but of course lah mutt is mutt is
I mean way better lah
eh um if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
oh I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
uh brixton is is is a europe bike ah
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
um
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money ah
you upgrade
mm
ah lah of course lah of course lah
no lah I mean I'm looking at my options
why ah
ya but super four is uh quite reliable bike ah
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
mm
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive ah sial
my my bike one bottle that means one litre lah so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no lah one month ah I mean right now COVID one month ah
back then eh no lah back then when I was working in uh
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month ah to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need ah
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay lah harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay lah let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul uh ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs ah
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why lah I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice lah I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
mm
oh
ya lah and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper ah
no the furthest I went with this bike was um desaru
the furthest I went with my was uh muar
ya ya lah
um
tow ah
they will go for the
the dangerous way ah
this one I I never tried ah I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you ah
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
uh power to push together
ah
eh
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders ah
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or uh a new overhauled engine
um
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike lah
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral lah
speaking of bike accidents
uh my father's friend ah
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga ah
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died lah sia
so so
before this guy died ah he told me lah then he was very different
eh you know forgive me ah if I ever sinned towards you ah
so on that day they went to
but same case ah he went under the truck
it's dangerous ah
oh speaking of dangerous riding kan I think one of their simulation lessons kan
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid ah sial
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can ah but then it's stupid ah
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike ah
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike ah no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
huh
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the kerb sia
that is far sia
mm
ya ya
huh
huh serious ah
oh the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting ah
he went home ah
it means quite quite bad lah
old guy ah
but big size ah
hazriq size ah
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike ah
I see that bike ah
alamak
what the guy is small or big
why sia why would he buy such a bike
no lah I mean if you scared I mean don't ride ah
maybe ah
but if you talk about those small bike ah
those those similar those kind of bikes ah
um there's this bike it's called uh honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike ah he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days lah which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know ah
mm
go back to office ah
so you're gonna take you bikes ah
stupid eh
huh
you can book everyday
legit ah
oh
if got two days later
mm
mm
then you exceeded the line ah
oh exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue ah
that was your last ah
assessment
fail ah
mm
mm mm
oh
mm
if there is a car you need to stop ah
ah
serious
mm
mm
bike instructor
ah serious ah
what if you hit into a car
who is the huh then the the damage all cover is it
mm
ya
no no no you have to okay so back then when I took a private kan the one I failed
so you will
as a start you will drive on the road
so it's
two point
and the two points is unlimited or I thought there's a limitation kan

oops
K K K K next next what next
yeah
mm go back to the future what I wanna do ah
wah this one very deep seh question
mm
err can we like pass can we do a easier non deep question you know ah this one I really need to think sia need to recall need to dwell on the past
ya too much feels
um currently now I am err working
ya
healthcare swabber
health promotion board
yup
uh huh uh huh yup so that's what I'm working as now lah currently then yourself
ah so this is what you call holiday lah not err just fresh graduate waiting to find a job
uh huh
the results
correct
okay finish already
uh huh
ah
hair tie and bag okay what on platforms like carousell
oh seller like those home based businesses
not like those mini one lah non non uh ACRA registered ah
ACRA ACRA
ya so if you own a business you need to start thinking about ACRA so ACRA is err let me tell you what it stands for ah it's accounting and corporate regulatory authority
ya so in it's a ministry whereby you need to you know all those income tax et cetera that kind I mean that is IRAS so this is ACRA ACRA is for business registration kind all those companies lah basically companies
ya but still err that's why they say unregistered home based businesses ah ha
ya and but are still unregistered you see so that kind lah so um ya I don't know this is like this grey those grey area kind apparently my start up is ACRA registered lah
ya
mmhmm mmhmm
I mean it's good lah so how is it doing so far
ah okay
okay so but so err haven't sell much at or haven't sell at all or
sell already
sell some already so is it doing well
so you just gonna do this
so sending out resumes already lah
okay I mean that's good that's a start wait so you're how old now just graduate in
walao still very young lah
what the hell twenty seven already ya
yup
ya but I'm stuck at uh twenty four
uh I mean like
I I
no I I'm really stuck at twenty four just that the facial hair growing at the age of twenty
no no I I I feel like err
no you you will you will understand once you age like like you feel like your age is fixed at a certain that one but the number just keeps increasing
nope you you you will you will you will soon
I am the last one
ya
oh you're the youngest also
okay and you're the youngest alright
yes because your wish is part of a superpower I actually want to ask like superpower itself because I wanna ask you so that because you have to ask me back lah ya so what superpowers do you want
uh apparently you already got that wish granted so now you're invisible
you already got you already got the power of dracula also and and uh okay uh the the the the food giving one eliminated
no you want to hear something new
ah
a teleportation
okay lah so just teleportation hmm okay good
in this era it would be
err
I mean assuming my wishes are granted then
err
wah ya like if I really were to think about something like in depth quite hard lah cause I I I want like I I want mind reading even though I can read people's err err
even though I can read people no even though I can read people I mean you might not know whether it's hundred percent true maybe it's just eighty percent
correctness but you want it to be like hundred percent right so mm mind reading maybe maybe not
err printing money apparently I already say if I don't have my wish granted yup I want that um teleportation sounds good also
mm but is it for one person or two person I don't know
your teleportation can teleport you only or like like you can hold people and like boom tele
ya ya ya
the err what do you call that night crawler ah
but night crawler need to imagine the place then you can go if you
uh so nightcrawlers one is limited ah err
woo seh
uh oh now ah um ah then suddenly
ah the red light district of singapore
oh now don't know I thought you say all okay imagine can just teleport only
ah oh I see oh now now you take back
yup I mean
whatever lah let's say my money dry up I just print some more lah
no lah not copy and paste ah just my hand like you know a deck of cards of money come out like that okay yup
the money is come out like that
can lah anytime you no need to get a genie lah my my superpower can lah give you some
today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one I think I asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no I I ask what I ask you superpower I ask err wish
you ask me what err what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I also I also short term memory
ah
ya it's the smallest err smallest more specialised err what you call that
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it lah it's such a small community
um but the best part is ya I'm not I am not practising it lah
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mechanical like um I deal more with uh like all the machine machine instead of people
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
in a in a way err the field lah I want to be is actually like err psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go err what you call that err undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that lah and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
uh huh so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do lah unless I can print money right then I mean like
that's that's wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
err ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money lah like I I don't know now at this age I mean I feel like money never enough already sadly
um okay let me think of a question okay
err K lah simple simple one lah I give you a simple simple one lah err no need ask
err we we start off with a very simple one what kind of music you like
slow piano
slow piano K pop english what kind of
okay so you so you err now I limit you to one genre
what is it yes
what's your favourite genre of music

boycott boycott boycott K
alright your turn then
what movies do I usually watch I actually don't watch movies I
err series and anime mainly ya
now now I'm still err on what you call that one piece

as long as err the the the caged up bees inside doesn't actually come out oh
yup that that's fine with me
mm the the awkward awkward amid teen wait you you eighteen already or not
oh then got the is it is it like out of twenty one kind of
oh I I got caught off guard
oh okay
ah that there's nothing much to me lah
okay let's uh let's see a random question ah

eh how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so err intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic what two people ah and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
which is good
mm yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
mm
yes
wah that's that's okay too kan
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course lah once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work lah for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though um
okay lah I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking wah I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating err calorie counting app lah I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it lah okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
oh
shoes I thought you like shoes
oh
eh but you will be more at the office part right
huh you have to also track just in case they need to run out
oh
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons lah but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily ah
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days oh okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job ah
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
err there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping one but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
oh okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay lah I mean I found some recipes online so err chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff lah so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
oh where's her workplace oh area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else ah yes can request ah
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with uh this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes lah all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
oh
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy lah to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
onigiri onigiri
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up oh just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
ah we wanted to eat sushi salmon mentaiko I think I'll just order that when we go to hei sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon mentaiko
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before lah the cuts I let you try before the say inadi with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and mentaiko torched
let's go eat that tomorrow oh that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one

ya for me today was okay ah
today today was my off day
of err leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave lah then
err I've been trying to clear so
then like um
today we had some random meeting
about err strength training like err for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water um
like the whole company lah from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to shanghai and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams lah but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test lah before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
mm it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
a bit
ya
ya a bit skewed err ya a bit skewed ah the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
err
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the shanghai branch and then ya we just shared lah then
I went first in that group and when I went first
I took like I think around three minutes lah let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy lah the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like oh err there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown lah to tell them to tell us that the break room is err going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of um shut down on the zoom orh
eh not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay lah not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
good to know lah when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
oh that sucks
mm do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure bo
sure bo
ah
huh
can like that meh
ya
then why you take
ah okay okay understand understand
ya seh
but ya uh
actually my last week was quite interesting ah
not interesting
but
err because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden err he joined the new shift lah
ya my three shift correct
so it like his first day was just me and him
oh no that day he that day
me and jaden
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do err
what was that err had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me eh just tomorrow
err tomorrow what's that ah oh tomorrow
I may not be able to oh no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was ah mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us eh on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge lah on that day
no it's not a big deal lah that job it's just
someone to be um
someone to be who's who will answer to the client lah
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like eh just I think err
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay lah why then he said oh because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad lah
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
I don't know lah I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt lah
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
err okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay lah I told him okay lah then go ahead lah you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day ah then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
um
wah damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not lah but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
um we are now separated into clients ya
oh cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know lah
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day lah because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like eh wait wait wait ah walao walao
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss lah I feel bad
um hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
err I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
eh no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day ah
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working lah
ya eh on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
oh you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve eh twelve thirty
then now it's like err three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
eh for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya lor so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
uh yes but then
um I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes uh
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult uh
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
I'm
my sleep is deprived
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
mm
it's like
if I were to sleep in kan that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team lah at least they are
they are not big fans of
um
this client
this huh
yes but
you can always learn uh you know what I mean
and it's a job ah you are getting paid
plus
ya
you just learn ah you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people uh because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good lah I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
like this current shift that I'm on lah I've been too complacent
um
I don't know I I just I
what's the word ah complacent uh when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like whoa like you know about this like
like oh because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers lah
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it uh
like last month or what then I realised oh shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference ah
whether they
can work with you or not ah like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
reserve
ya
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this um
this file
then like
um from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines lah like what are the headlines for today so
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines lah ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like oh I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it uh when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
mm
often time
but now
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
jaded ya
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
mm
wow
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
no
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
this whatever can pick up
people
mm
mmhmm
it's too loud
okay
okay
mm
ya lah
no but I just
kind of conversation
oh so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay lah I think it is their job lah
a'ah lah
weeb
weeb do you have that in the dictionary weeb
weeaboo
I don't think so please don't
maybe don't ya maybe don't

that's the beauty of it
mm
the actual thing

flexible
project

sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your

kind of put it upon themselves also what
mm
a'ah
ya
a'ah
mmhmm
and the
ya
okay what other movies
the wailing yes yes yes yes yes definitely
correct
ya
yes
a'ah seh
oh
correct ya right
mm it's every it's all the things that I appreciate in films put together and like whoa I was so surprised eh
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what I mean make me make me question my current relationships with like people that I know like my family even are they the people they are
ya sia
exactly
wah you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not
I forgot about that
a'ah
mm
ya
mm mm
ya
mm
you're also insignificant
correct correct
mm
uh then who did I watch with
this indonesian woman
uh can watch online if you want eh you want to watch today
ya
why
mm
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that one will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know ah movies are
just tough stuff ah because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
mmhmm
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
wah
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this uh you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by blah blah blah
mm
mm
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see ah
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
ah okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
ah but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also what
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay lah not that bad
han orh
why
okay
okay
mm
mm understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
mm I try play on Borderland lor
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
mm
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things eh like ugh
things for speedy for my cat
um
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else ah
oh I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought um
to for the mugen train I bought the demon slayer masks
I I I I I only want one which is the
nezuko one
I ordered four
of course lah but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
mmhmm
ya
adli's watching
ya
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
I feel like when everybody watches it
the special
ya
ya
uh huh
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible uh that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also ah because like
thankfully
due to the
or haikyu maybe it's gotten quite popular
it's so easy to find
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
mm
a'ah
mm
ya so that's what I'm talking about ah
hard to be a fan when they're not very
ya
mm
so like
okay understand
mmhmm
okay
oh
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
um because I don't know ah it's different ah it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
err
she's very she's very quiet lah but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun uh
how about japanese content how are they like then she's oh she doesn't actually watch a lot
there are not
as many well known
um
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
ya real dramas
um
it's not as popular lah in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so oh I just do writing because she does err makeup
like uh she studies
err what's that called cosmetics I think
um I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore lah that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
then she said oh she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it lah then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
um like during high school and all that
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian one lah because
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID ah
jakarta
ya lah
but she used to live in yoyga also yogyakarta
very nice ah they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different lah what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
ah I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
uh huh
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
kidding
um
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so um I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
in the thousands so like
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like um
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids what
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya koreaboo
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
wah I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online lah because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
um I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like wow and like it's hundred and four eh
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it um
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech eh
say it's for Logitech

ya I don't know why I've no idea lah so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there lah but you have a recommendation where
mm
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
mm
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
mm or any of the malls around there lah
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said lah take out handphone take take the
mm
oh
that time mm ya
ya lah that one is
ah mothers' day tau I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
mm
that one I not too sure lah but you know they earn also not much
ya
err I think her mum lah her mum surely will will
uh oh
ya lah if you pay then I think cannot lah I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full lah I think if they full also it'll be
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya lor but if ya lah okay lah if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars lah then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that lah but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
mm mm
I think the rain was
oh
you stay there ya lah will damage all the property lah
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm lah
oh
mm
orh
ya lah ya lah but mm
mm
ya lah the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that lah
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
mm mm
ah
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya lah but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high lah okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
uh uh maybe ya
ya I think so
ya lah but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction lah I think when the
so ya lah you can see that actually
ya lah some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya lah if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
kan nowadays mm
mm
true ya mm
ya once in awhile jer lah
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya lor but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay lah ya lah okay lah if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
mmhmm
whenever you on the fan lah you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya lah but funny
a'ah
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe err get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya lah like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya lah
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the kan they do everything at around your what you call that
mmhmm
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people lah
okay lah but better lah like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
err can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing lah it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they err those india and china those populated countries who have like err haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
mm you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive what you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this err COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake lah ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya lah
mm ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya lah once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya mm mm
ya that's what I mean lah ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad what like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
mm
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
mm

for lunch
so expensive
the delivery
newton eh
okay lah the feels to eat satay is there
what time is my breakfast
okay
mmhmm
eh eh
wah
no lah okay first few times he asked me
I mean I don't want to say his name lah
but ya
then like after that people keep asking me
like we exchanged stories lah and then turns out that he has been asking around
and then like he has never bought his own pack of cigarettes which is like weird
oh no
until a certain while we all stopped giving and then he like go to another group of people to ask like
like
and like the cheese is there
ya
um mostly like indian malay food lah know the the normal kind
woodlands eh
like
make you put on put on weight faster
okay
mm
satay eh
mm
oh
mm
google maps says that there is a bus
high eh
mm
wah
I don't think I can make it lah if I wanna go venture into that kind of industry
mm
straight ahead
okay so
turn left here and then we got to take the overhead bridge
ah okay I can see already I can see the lights from here
ah
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
the night is still young seh
you know that I have oversized shirts right
wah grabhitch eh
very lucky
ya grabhitch very rare you know people get grabhitch
I mean I feel like it depends on your luck what because like let's say the driver is going wherever you're going
and then the driver happens to be in the same area as you
then you will get it what
mm
ah okay lah
mm mm
wah
mm mm
mm
mm
az
people say
don't cry over spilled milk tau
for my birthday but then we cannot go bali right so I want to eat indonesian food
mm
okay lah that's like
soon in six days
but we need to
save some money for dinner lah if you want to plan for dinner
mm
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself lah in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
speak
mm
no okay do you even okay maybe you do lah but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
mm
mm
I think we grew up differently lah
ah
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
uh wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
eh wonder woman seh
that's the villain lah for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan seh to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
it's gonna be so
mm mm
money makes the world go round eh
ya lah
but
mm
uh maybe we do something different lah you know that they have this like
you know those uh escape rooms
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality
world ah through the eyes
ya anyways those uh virtual reality rooms ya we can consider doing that I think
I think it's about
forty five minutes ah
okay lah if you calculate it's like one minute one dollar
you have to accommodate to um all the group who you know that uh not all our friends like to LAN right
mm mm
but the future is bleak right now bro
that's why we are balanced
hais
eh
mm mm
and then my next pay probably is twenty twenty one
new year new me wah
um
ya
so
huh that's a I think this topic of like what to eat
it's like
a deep dark hole you know
because like
so much difficulties thinking about what to eat
what to eat nevermind you you need to think about whether you want to order in and then like there's the delivery fee and all that to consider
context of
having the difficulty to
choose what to eat
mmhmm
catching
mm
okay
so
ya
wah wah wah wah wah
ya lah because twenty dollars divide by six people
mm
too emotional sometimes
it's true
hmm
okay lah
I mean it's just like to some people
and
the booking for the staycation
wait so need to let them know lah tomorrow morning
no because we never talk about when to tell them
so we need to let them know tomorrow morning when we wake up on the way to work
eh just message the group lah we have a group
ah
wait is it
I was looking at the furnitures lah to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website lah bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
huh spend six hundred wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty lah
but okay that doesn't matter ah
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know lah maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the can be different lah
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
ah LUMOS aura projector
and then ah projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a or the projector
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
cause ya lah
ah adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
mmhmm
uh huh
kan I also had that concept
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky uh
ah the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
and then we still have spare
we can uh I mean
divide lah the money then I would probably wanna buy like a a new laptop
for school
mm mm
alhamduls
mm all the best for that
like that's the thing about humans lah
when you get extra
complain when you get shortage complain it's like our culture
hais
I would prefer to spend that money on food then on grab
ya lah
kan the first few music we won't be sleeping also
cause like we will get comfortable
what lah you don't want to watch like this
mm

maybe it's the same with us eh
when we are in a rush when you have to rush to your appointment all you you slam the door what
ya
eleven more minutes soon lah
what you want to eat after this
you want a drink I can I can look at the drink
err baileys ya koi
koi and I don't buy from koi I mine is share tea
huh
so the you know that thing is called a segway right here where you don't need to walk you just drive so the owner apparently use err
use the segway and just drove off a cliff and died ironic right your own emergent killed him
I think segway is a very err lazy way like you can walk walk ah I mean unless you are like a a person who has difficulty with physical physical task if not just walk
no peacekeeper there these people the you can see
err cyprus ah the they are they are neighbours what
orh we went when we had the car right we rented the car over there ah ya ya ya we went inside before the inside with aisyah oh really
for good
oh
on weekdays a bit hard lah
mmhmm
putri ah
the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive eh and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's err very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them uh checklist err time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time lah
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
what is your opinion on aldemir
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion ah
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very err it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king faisal the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
of what
what's on oh they watching or what
by who
the government
they're pragmatic lah ya ya
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot eh honestly
ya obviously you gonna you gonna get
don't don't eff around man in in other people countries it's not right lah you
he's not gonna get in

eh hi hi izzati long time no see

my one of my my brothers I got two brothers
ya
on money now
mm
ya
so
I
ya lah
you cannot monitor what they do or what you have to trust them you know their whatever they submit as work
then my boss call me can you imagine your boss keep calling you like
twenty four seven like around the clock because you have deadlines to meet and then there's no
break it's more worse lah if you have to work at home kan
where you know nine to five office ya office hours
ah just hope COVID will end soon
ya ya
I hope so lah because right now I think there's still local cases kan according to
ya but
oh ya
you know so at least
most likely like you said ah phase three
ya tracetogether
I feel like
wah last warning sia I feel I feel like the whole situation is just
Grab
circuit bake baker is it
no ah I feel
I I feel that my my circuit baker apps is not
good enough my my skill are not good enough though
what serious
oh
I managed to do that ya I managed to
those a bit complicated like I feel I feel dalgona is a bit complicated I prefer to be just buy it
err I tried I tried
I don't know busy lah
I prefer
I I still prefer to just buy and
oh
oh so is it your
ang mo kio

that's the only twenty four hours I have there at my house
ya
nevermind lah
mm
oh with who like
ah yes yes
ya can you imagine the amount of people that you have to cut down this is
this is good because for people like me which is I'm like I'm like uh introvert so I don't
believe in like you know inviting so many people
this is good I also feel like ugh
cause my
my I have siblings what I have older brothers
so their
I have one that is thirty
three right now and one is
why don't we marry them off first then I can talk about marriage
you know
so
ya ya I'm attached I'm attached
he's actually uh not muslim so he has to convert what we're we're taking converting classes right now
so ya
ya
I don't I also don't think I have that much friends
I think it's only one once
one hand
ten people I think I have eight people in the attitude is just extra I have to invite because they're family you know
right now then I feel that
my brother oh my my first brother he's gonna get engaged
ah end of this year december

ya
ugh low lowkey
ya I miss shopping at malaysia
AEON mall

johor bahru
no not yet
not yet I'm still taking my driving license also right now
ya lah cause it's a good time what you don't have to wait so long to get

like uh a placing ah cause right now I done with my

then they say that you can straightaway
you know sign up for
driving classes already
you don't have to wait no normally there's a period between like
weeks to months ah you have to wait right
but right now it's just days only so it's okay lah I can just like
take my time
I mean it's not so bad lah you know this COVID period just make do with what we have
uh
it's so rimas you like wearing the mask
aren't you in events

ya that and ya the weather is just hot cold hot cold alamak
so right now you doing events under what
you doing events under what
you doing events under
uh what company
oh I think
oh okay
government grant kan
ya it's just like is this at tuas
this job requires you to do this this this
it's just simple steps you know but then they expect you to have like oh five years experience in you know
doing that type of job I'm like huh
hello
I don't see
what's the
I mean also
the pay isn't good then it's tough times what right now
oh teaching you got a teaching cert ah
oh
I did I did apply for teaching though then um
and then they say that oh uh you don't have a teaching cert from no I don't why do I need a teaching cert to be a tutor though
ya but like
why you need cert for that if you just gonna be a private tutor I don't I don't really see the need
need for that it's not really
it's not like you don't feel like
it's good workplace for you to stay if you like a bit toxic
oh ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
that's the whole point of training what
uh huh
wah
right
ya
just just toxic ah
the it's work from home
if you
why you don't prefer
okay lah technically I come from a background so
most of my job
prefer face to face lah so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that oh I want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it lah
mm
you can say that uh I do
I do mostly the front end
it's called and design lah
so ya not not if you see
oh
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture kan
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people lah so
one part of the the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call eh hi how um
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
look at the computer and then there's
do uh oh ya
we cannot complain much ah because
COVID mah
forever sia
ya
err but I feel like
ah I just want to
don't you feel like
you lacking the human interaction
uh
only now what I get to see you so
but it's limited to five
ah
paitao
ya like
I feel you I feel you
like
you come out from your room and then you see their faces you mean
round the clock you have to see their faces I feel you
ya
how many siblings you have
what why oh oh because she's longer in a
a longer relationship is it
oh
oh make okay lah make kind of makes sense because
she got stable job she's she's um
she don't have to
oh she's not
she's a
oh so right now she's also finding for job lah
oh okay lah there's some source of income lah
ya considered a luxury ah because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims what so we do have to you know
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then uh
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really ah that one I don't know sia
oh really ah
what how long already
you and your
oh
how how long have you guys been together
uh I don't think so
almost three years
mm
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
oh my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because err my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and err ya cause I
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there ah I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
um like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
uh huh
mm
ya lah I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
um you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded lah
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl ah then they expect a lot of you
female
get out ah
mm
mmhmm
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you uh get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
zao zao
mm
a'ah
mm
well okay lah actually
oh
no for me my
my boyfriend's place is just um
just enough for his family ah I cannot really move into his place
so
no uh um
then what you feel what
oh
I think that's most likely you know
ya my
they move out I don't I don't hope for them to come over
no lah it's not like I don't like it's just
and I got
cats also and she's scared of cats
my
yes
she's very scared of cats though I I not sure how it's gonna turn out
hais
six people is too crowded already bro
I cannot
ya
I
but I really
how about no I should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats lah
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
I saw that coming from a mile away
huh ya lah basically jurong
people are weird I understand I get that a lot
okay they always say jurong people are weird
I I have to admit ah because down here there's a lot of crime that
steal underwear kind
um okay cool I didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
I
I like nowadays I don't
ya
ya
jurong shady ah jurong
especially the west side
country
there's a lot of uh there's not much of commercialised building it's more of uh
industrial building
so a lot of um
foreigners there lah
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
you will be scared lah because
uh all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation um
those um touch and run away kind
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house kan
I take I walk from pioneer
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that uh people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know uh
they even take he even took the same lift as me
uh
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know lah
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight ah come ah fight ah
ya
ya ang mo kio
ya got industrial places what there
uh huh
ya I get you
if you know what it's always like that though
I would rather
tanjong pagar still not bad what
tanjong pagar still not bad I feel like around cause my
at city hall
around there
I cannot ah I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so jurong staying at jurong west is quite fitting for me lah you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in jurong west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
okay lah I mean it depends lah
jurong east also considered area but then
what's that area called ah you know hua yi there I forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the
but it's also not close to any
no noises lah you know if you prefer that
ya
oh
ya
used as back up right now lah because of COVID
ya I feel you man I also got some savings that I thought like you know
err rent house somewhere near my office also
somewhere more accessible ah
no not at town at least like
maybe at most
east side ah cause east side I know
east and north side basically is
you got direct transport to town what
ya but my area my west like we have to
okay also direct transport but then
it's really long ah
and it gets crowded
at my area boon lay there you know so
I don't do I don't do again I don't do well with crowds ah eh
what to do
I just can't
what's that called your
currently your plan is what
to
ya like cause you were saying that
you prefer to get married right now right
oh
mmhmm
ah
eight years is a really long time
so
hopefully he will change his we it will because you got say before that he is madam
focus on school
just spendings what
ya that's like totally different
don't we all girl don't we all
your boyfriend what race
your boyfriend what race
what race

how you guys met
how you guys met
ah online dating
ah for for me I feel like thirty five still quite young though
I I actually I
uh
with my current partner now
oh okay
your prime age
ya
but you have to think about the cost and everything
cause my
ya my my boyfriend is also uh
chinese but he's a italian chinese
he's more of the european side
so
I feel that there is a communication barrier between us lah but
uh
that was it's still okay lah it's manageable
uh in terms of
uni ya cause we same we same course he's taking the same course and then we have similar interest which
which is uh gaming
you game also what game

ah
rapatkan sangat kecuali pasal waktu kerja
mm
mm
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
consider of uh finding something else lah like what you have done which is good
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
ah consistency how you want to keep your consistent ah status
making sure that whatever you have done
ah you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like ah do something without knowing what you are doing correct ah
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon eh kevin
yes correct ah you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
huh
ah so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
you want english you want malay you want english or malay or you want korean
do they have muslim in korea
tomorrow they are coming down right to see the exhaust thing lah correct tomorrow you follow me lah help me eleven to eleven thirty
that one we settle first then number two right ah
I will bring him to see victoria you know that same place victoria
so you can assure victoria that you are also come down and check your due diligence
we left already fiona told me eh rasyidi you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost lah
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very ah
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
later I show you ah the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means ah
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
people will go there just to buy food and go away ah and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs lah
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
no the you mean the cement eh
the cement will be the second half of the unit what second half
it means it's not the for the front tau the front will be rental it would not go up huh
maybe they have to put some
they can go to the level one toilet
mm so
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
ah a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that oh the sprinkler worse ah don't need do submission
her consultancy ah the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
ah to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct
ah
ah
and I think this this few days I will shoot invite to all the
they got cash flow problem
if there's an issue then they share with us it's good for us to know correct ah of course they can deny lah but of course you you know their problem
oh actually I will get my specialist to contact you okay fine
at least there's some progress tau
ah next week monday kan
and you can undergo a unit where a haggard ah then I'm going to my muscular that gotten my email and
if they want to do seventeen to be orientation then we let them do
no need to rush to rush ah we just tell them okay this is the powerpoint
this is the ah rooftop what key we going to draw out right right
ah so far so far ah so far I I have not seen them doing that
correct so safety aspect they may want us to provide them a a more secure ladder which I will get lye to quote lah
I I I think ah the new ladder doesn't matter lah correct justifiable correct
because they are our term so they need to access quarterly or as and when
nevermind boss you can smile until tomorrow boss but my appraisal boss

um so if you are an avenger what avenger will you be
and why
so
ya
is that your final answer
lock it in
um
I would want to be
um
I think I wanna be
iron man
it's boring but ya
because he's rich
and he has lots of gadgets
pretty cool
and he is cocky
but he's nice and cocky
I like him
ya like you know like if on netflix there's a lot of avengers movie I I just watch iron man one two three over and over again I don't know what's wrong
but ya
err
mmhmm
um got thor he's rich he owns the thunder
ya exactly
exactly
um ya um but ah you mentioned you don't like avengers what actually you like you like
superhero superhero
oo why why why
mmhmm
I watch all spiderman
but like toby maguire he's just so sad
ya he's always sad like
he's always sad like it's so hard to find him happy only towards the ending that also I find it sad
it's just naturally
it's like awkward when I when I look at him smiling
err ya
sad
ya
err ya um
any recent movies that you are in
mulan
cartoon
damn I didn't watch that
um binge any binge netflix
I know right
I love it man mm
um recently I'm more like I watch toughest prison in the world
interesting
mmhmm hmm
it's very interesting um norway
has the most luxurious oh my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage um milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know um apparently they spend one point two
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then err that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals um but err
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like um like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
um of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though um ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much ah
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya true
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying um
err the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
vulgar ya maybe can um ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
different
because like err norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same ah philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya
mmhmm
kan
mmhmm hmm
mm
mmhmm
for black friday
no I just want to make sales I'm like I'm still thinking of mechanics
ya err
ah actually sells a lot of shit ya so she just opened a new shop the one that I share with you
ya ya ya repurpose those vintage whatever crap people will buy
um actually it has been going on for a while like actually like when I spoke
ah
um
ah they actually have a stamp at the back ya so she cover that
do the mechanics for ourselves ah to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged um someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her lah then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing ah if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn what
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya mm it's stainless steel
it's just too expensive for me I cannot ya
a'ah
mmhmm mmhmm
so not planning
to use
mmhmm
Maxi Cash Maxi Cash

when the gram go higher it's to do sell
no no no no no I mean you can sell now feel free
ya you earn a lot ya so it's a bit hard
ya mmhmm

no he just buy all plants and he grows inside his room
err ya ya so he buys all those
whatever crap
he's a legit err ya I am not surprised
it exotic plants my friend exotics ya so he and then he sells ah at a higher price that's his business he earns so much more than my lashes like he can earn about seven hundred dollars per day when he has the the the one ah the plant that people wants
since it's real
I know right
which is a
a lot of resales from Carousell
then he then he open a new

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday lah ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with lah
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like uh if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment

get back to me on that but he's not

in suria
um I don't know if you watched but is a classic drama is a local
uh show
made by suria
no lah uh I'm glad that
Netflix
watch any movie anytime anywhere
uh and you also
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite uh show or anime
so now
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
um
eh um
sorry
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
then uh maybe
grades
and um
uh
so when do you graduate
two years
um
I only left with
four months
um then after four months
then
um just
work
then uh if there's
uh school school uh if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
so it's best for me to work
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about uh
uh money anymore
I
okay with
because uh
but ya
good that uh I have a friend like you
err that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
join rugby
so I've
played rugby
ya so
rugby err
is with me since uh secondary school
and now I'm in a uh club
uh tamoko lions
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
I can see on my uh
meets
ya
uh I recently got injured because of my bad leg
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that uh nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
orh
um when I was young I like extreme sport
um
err then uh
secondary school I go to
err
skatepark and I like skateboarding
uh hopefully that
um
speaking of commitments uh I think
err
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
um I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably err go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news ah fake news
so uh I really want to go karaoke with my friends ah
and for my girlfriend uh probably go out on a date
somewhere uh and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
oh
uh anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
oh ya um actually
err go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
oh uh
um
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go sentosa
uh go beach with my family and
and uh you know swim
um I'm not afraid of heights
are you
um
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
um I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube err like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
uh I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
err when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
um my favourite car is
uh
uh
uh is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
um
my favourite car is mostly uh japanese
for example uh Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
um
tokyo drift is one of them
ah actually
but I only watch till
and I watch uh
way before ah
uh nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because uh he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
err like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
um
and uh the manager himself that uh brought man untied to win uh
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
uh they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win uh all the uh season
and err what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
uh probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work

pay the lesson again that's why
no for
ya
ya so
I have to pay one thousand two hundred dollars in total that's what noriman said lah
probably lah
err admission fee is it is that what it's called I think that's what it's called
you didn't know we have already been talking for five minutes
maybe maybe right you should slow down a bit you know
like ya you are talking too fast
ya exactly like like just now
like oh my god
you know err about the
uh shit
know the if you didn't know what to say right there's actually this like list that they give you like they will tell you like what to say like what to ask the other person
you actually looking now okay since like uh we've been doing this like a podcast style come ah ask me some questions
okay I'll wait
ya see see lah see ah I think one of the first questions is err if you had three wishes what would it be
ya
eh you know private matter ah
private matter ah
do you think they actually understand us like when we talk in malay are they like some some malay
like somebody who is a malay like actually or someone who can speak malay like review all these and understand what we talking about
ya ya ya for one hour
I'm sorry lah guys eh I'm sorry lah guys like you have to listen to us talk
nonsense for one hour
hopefully uh I mean I'm actually thankful that there's such an opportunity
foreigners so they what oh they the frontliners
frontliners
oh
power eh
uh huh kan they see honesty sia
my timing now nine forty yes ah okay lah save that
I still don't understand how they gonna do it like the clap thing I'm still quite confused actually lah
but err
mm mm mm so like just in case you know
you know find work and three three weeks I'm positive for three weeks then you have your
for you page eh was
kan kan
so it
she my dad don't want her to go warehouse cause she hasn't doesn't want her to go there lah I ask her like just take retail lah instead
my sister
ah it's like she just she's after O level ya after O level already
ya I said
hopefully hopefully
at least
lame ah lame ah
about about
town red what town
when I was sec three
it is much more err not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
err you just come
mayor lah then like also same same thing like
there the town will like discuss on who is the
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game ah
but if we're in town of salem this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game lah but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore
ya something like that lah but you have to survive ah basically their task is to survive ya lah like among us
ya not one impostor like
like mafia mafias like got your three people together
did you watch this err youtube
wah banana
it's called I forgot what is they called it
I don't know I don't know what they called it but they also they also play some game similar to that
you know that they didn't want to play properly they don't know know how to say how to like lie and everything
huh like vlogging is it
huh
oh like stomp like that ah
mm
oh I think I know rice gum wait wait rice gum all talks about all the beef and everything
oh
so all he just talk about all the youtube beef and everything like that ah
oh so
but the thing is like rice gum right he was once the king of youtube you know like at a point of time in my opinion lah later you remember like the beef beef the beef between rice gum and
eh no the and the sidemen and everything remember that whoa
ya that ya bro that is twenty seventeen bro it was trending that's why all of us were talking about it
trend man
ya the prime of youtube whoa I was
so grateful that was alive for that chey
now a good thing what like I think about it right it's like actually it's much more harder to do it's much more harder than a podcast and talk for like
hours and hours
no it's like got this oh ya true they have a ya uh uh
four twenty four twenty minutes jer eh four minutes twenty seconds
purposely ah tell you all for the joke ah but then every single but then he stop he stop err he stop

I haven't finish watching demon slayer my girlfriend want me watch the movie so I watch the movie first then I finish the series
the movie is like continue straight from the series
not say finale ah but like continuation
ya
cause I think
cause the series
eh forty minutes then
so technically you are watching
one episode
a two hour episode you know what I mean
ya lah
what do you mean doesn't feel like one hour as compared to movie
oh oh I get what you mean
ya ya ya ya ya cause
I know right technically series is like a very long movie if you think about it if compile everything together
mm
if you wanna watch you should watch it like it's not bad lah demon slayer

loki loki quite cool though like interesting you know like a new dimension of loki
loki from another dimension
ya lah they were the one to killed the character technically the character is dead
in
technically
technically if you think about it right if they open a multiverse right dimension all these they won't die lah the characters won't die
and the thing is suddenly like the other character from the other universe can come here come back you know
ya
somehow or some way they will come back one day
mm mm
mm mm mm exactly
that maybe that's why they want to do that's why they want to do with the movie they want to do something like the comics
it also make a lot of money so
oh ya ya ya
huh
oh I get it I get it I get it
deadpool
forty minutes
ya

cause

how do I know if it's still recording is it still recording oh yes it is still recording
ya okay so anyway I eat my breakfast at
he took the power ranger mask and then I was sleeping so I didn't realise it
and when I open my eyes this is small dude was trying to put on the face mask was trying to put the power ranger mask on my face
like it's a bit not like bend fully but it's a bit like bendable so what happened was he actually took it and I think I didn't see I honestly don't know what happened but I think I assume that he actually bend it until it broke after it broke he just looked at me guess what face he made
ya I never even scold him and then
yup he cry and then I immediately sent him to the room terrible sia this boy
no he was about to so he was burying his face in the that one
he was burying his face in the pillow then eventually I check out check up on him and then he was actually like
falling asleep but he he didn't ah then by the time already I went out then after that he okay
why did I ask him to go out
eleven fifty was he late today
oh ya anyway did you read the have you printed the form
ya
ya actually by thursday we have to submit the form
ya but I only have two tupperware and like
ya that's true ah
how many minutes do we have to talk more
oh ya you know what happened
ya I think you can gossip here but okay you say you say what happened then since you don't like to talk so much what happened
so he actually vomitted at work and then they sent him home because it's like you know COVID measures and stuff like that
ya then after that no he had to go to doctor straight but I think he didn't or what ah cause the company just sent him home straight and then he kind of actually tell them ya exactly but the symptoms are silly ah as in like I'm vomitting
because my wife is pregnant alah whatever lah papa was a bit annoyed by it ah
is it really
ya that's true ah
that so mean
oh ya I don't know lah but anyway after that he came back home and then he kept
what colour
oh chey because ishan wants to learn malay oh
that he sent the a video is it
a photo oh ya what was I doing ah
can't remember was I was I doing
ya
you cannot say that these people can't hear eh can't see
so mean digging my nose
it is not a chore it is like
quite fun I mean we can finally we have finally have a reason to talk to each other for one hour
ya we have to wait for the aircon to come ya because we cannot on the fan that's quite sad this this rule kinda suck
ya cause if there's ya which means
oh dear
no I didn't
ya whatever lah
oh so married people cannot eat
soup
steamed
no mama already going out tomorrow papa is going to play golf in the day so I can he can fetch me in in the afternoon but I don't think so
keat hong
really
I don't know so how do actually people talk for good sixty minutes I'm sure it's not all content we're all just gossiping right now so
fifty minutes no I'm very pretty sure that it's supposed to be one hour
meet the fifty
ya lah okay lah
ya exactly actually my kids will actually talk more but then I don't think four years old can talk
papa why animal ya papa what animal starts with letter
oh yes that sounds like fun
oh anyway now I have a new game okay lah maybe you should be the one talking ah because you are actually falling asleep we have err like another fifty more minutes to it
feels like you are
talk about ariq he got a new bike her brother's bike also
a'ah a'ah
I said motorbike
I'm sure they all know everybody else's bike like thousand except for his
seven thousand
everybody wants to buy a bicycle now
I want a car
I don't care I still want a car
ya maybe whatever I just need a convenience of a car so used to having it at
ya that's true ah I think we will still keep the bike in the long run
ya but until you are old and grey
really
confirm
eh ya so disgusting so far
what what what do people do in the east ya but that's more travelling time so means longer time for you to come back home and go
ya but definitely double seh the timing
kan
ya definitely
ya inclusive of traffic light dude
like from the moment I step and ya that's true the walking is then fifteen twenty in the run that's not true walking is about thirty minutes
just now a'ah
then teacher amirah like say about the that's why I want to check
ya
next week but we supposed to submit the form by tomorrow which you forgot to print
ya I told you today
ya I just tell I just got to know today but usually they will issue a form
then can you acknowledge it online
because the form was sent online
cheap phone with no iphone is like the most straightforward phone
really
march oh ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
really
ya but still that's a month apart what it's not the same date what
I don't know ah let me think about it ah I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that ah which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home ah cause the home is a bundled family thing what
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
oh
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
but with no sub charges ah
oh chey how sure are you
oh but you cannot change to singtel
same like ayim right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay lah
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya sia it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what oh you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course lah someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like uh
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish what
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
ira jer ah
that's not nice
I I don't want to put anymore ill thoughts on azmi
mm
he's going to what
oh I'm so afraid that he's gonna lose his job sia
he has his tendency of
where did you get this idea from
no don't be don't be bullshit that's not true my goal in life was never to be a housewife
alhamdulillah okay lah I don't think it's any girl's dream to be a housewife okay lah there are girls ira dream is to be a housewife
ya but alhamdulillah ya kind of I think so as in like we never thought that I will be the one who's gonna be a housewife but
not for long I plan to work soon so I am working now as we are speaking this is income
ya it is I mean some money is still money
my money is not off yours so hey that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me
no the example they give was repeating the same word like
ya okay then let's think of a topic okay let's think about what we can do to the house
oh really
stay in bunk stay in bunk
but stay in camp ah for one day eight to five
huh stay in
eh but not like meh like COVID meh why would they put you in camp if they are not gonna let you do anything
swab you have never done
how bad was it
papa abu has to take every week you know eh every week eh every two weeks
that's not true I have very small and cute nose
I think we have a lot of things to talk about
I have a lot of things to talk about and I need you to be the one who reply so then the the conversation ya lah that's true just trying to pull your leg the conversation has to be a bit of malay also
ya
no but I want to be a balance of both I want them to actually think we are so good
whatever dude
at the same time we have a lot of overlapping so we have to get that not so much ah
means when I speak you want to speak when you speak I want to speak
ya which means I keep interrupting you lah
which is not supposed to be what it's supposed to be understand
yes they are confirm going
yup uh better not come
that's so mean anyways I've already asked my dad for the car so
it's just that
ya and it's just that they open at twelve
it's quite late
all the way until six
you dah book
I don't know
oh so you can just stay in for the from opening till closing ah
how sure are you
ya
ya but we stayed all the way like until the fireworks ended which was about like closing and it's like yours
one person has to talk at a time
no I'm just saying ya but I let you keep quiet then I interrupt
I'm in the middle of the conversation then you
then you tend to like murmur I we're not gonna do this here we're not gonna be fighting in the middle of a recording
there you actually waited that's just all I'm asking for you to do
I
ya
you know there's a red line which means you spoke too loud was it you or me ya
no because you went you won't see then it did it got shock
no just now when I read they say you if there's a red don't know what then it means your voice is a bit too loud
no lah obviously not void lah dude ya exactly I'll be so disappointed
ya that's not true
okay I'm sorry I will not interrupt you again
hater
teacher check but the teacher just kept quiet teacher very biased sia there was another kid that checked in before ya then the teacher say like oh remember nana also mentioned about aqil having ulcer then they don't wanna admit him in ya but I'm very sure that my kid doesn't have inshaallah doesn't have
ya

that's not fair you have such feast while we at home starve on to death

I think I want to read people's mind do I really hmm
what would you want the superpower to be
ya
fly
that's not a superpower dude
because he's rich
ah
really such a
oh ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function oh is it oh that's his flaws
ah
I don't know actually if I have a superpower I think if I have a superpower I will travel back in time
dude mine is the most superpower among your rich rich is not a superpower

your wife
I'm not gonna let you buy me
with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually mm I don't know what a superpower be
then another one more was
last

ya
ya then rizal got stabbed then what else happen
oh ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
err
ya exactly so which means ushu have to still like be in good terms with them what
rahman sia
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house what
that's very um vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya lah that's true ah
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it ah meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say eh I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
huh
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting ah as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know lah he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand lah could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know lah I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
mm ya
ya lah true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the de la salle
five years of course ah he's like that what which is good ah I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around choa chu kang area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works sia
alhamdulillah
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
inshaallah no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block what
ya probably lah
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay lah also not bad
can he go
ya lah that's true
inshaallah inshaallah
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school what de la salle is a catholic school
so
oh ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else oh I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya lah that's true see how lah I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
eh dude
eh
what's wrong with that it's good what to be prepared

nowadays lah like I I really want to travel lah I really want to save money and
and travel lah so ya lah a lot a lot you cannot do a lot of things right now lah
mm you know during COVID so
ya so all I can do is is find job right now ah the the last
they're talking about talking about my uh barbering job and all that I
I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that lah so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought um monday since since uh like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay lah the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night lah night shift like I can work from eleven to
err eleven to I think
seven ah seven seven eleven near
near my house lah near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny leh I I didn't
I didn't get a reply ah they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get seh I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job kan
ah yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're err ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so ah it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier lah so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which uh which location you prefer
then
huh
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call lah then they so far never call they're taking quite some time ah I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true lah true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that err right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that um
some people are not really serious about the job lah they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point lah so
that's what my mother said lah then I I think I think quite
true lah like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
err I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they ah um
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
err diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary lah a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs lah so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya lah of course lah I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like um if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time lah I will I will do mm
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently lah I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up lah definitely like um
ya getting easily more tired or you know like um
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different lah when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like um oh I'm the best I can do
oh I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
um you realize
you're not really the best ah other people better than you or then you
you start to ya lah it's a different thing lah
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also lah different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya lah different different privileges
yes
correct lah actually actually true lah I I
ah I know I mean the the the thing is that because err right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk lah I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
ah nicely have respect for elders but
huh I don't know about the the the the current um I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all lah some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have um respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job lah teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people lah so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them lah like um
like old old people old values lah old values like like um
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya lah it's it's all a small thing lah at the moment mm ya
mm
maybe ah because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay lah that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
mm
pass very fast lah for me so
so a'ah lah
was more relaxed lah more
laid back chill ya
so um
COVID I mean
mm
apocalypse no lah
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing ah nothing much lah
I I was just trying to get along earn money lah you know ya
ya
oh okay okay okay ya the first the very first um
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one lah phase one circuit breaker was
was ya lah it's a bit a bit um
a bit stressful lah stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
oh circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like ah I I don't care lah I will still go out lah I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that lah I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing lah then I I
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing lah so it's not like
just go out you know like
um
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also lah
ya
weird lah you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly um
hmm
mm
ya mm definitely different
different time lah you know err nobody
nobody expected this to happen lah so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed lah that time they a lot of people stressed err a lot of uh
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry lah then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct mm
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs eh actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like tampines interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from tampines interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like um
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
err cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot uh like harder
times lah a lot of people going through like more hardship lah you know that
if you think you are like
quite sometimes I feel quite um
I just feel quite sad lah sometimes when I see all this lah ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced lah forced to
forced to stop working and
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
ya but anyway like um
mm
mmhmm
wherever lah
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business ah catering business they do sell
ya then it's not only that lah uh basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped lah then no cannot get money lah music business
so the next thing that
err like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies lah video
I mean um
right now video is doing
more important lah video is doing well lah like ya um
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a err uh to make a content right so
are out there lah there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
oh I if had taken a video err course or what then
mm
is like lessons from home all zoom zoom lessons from home right so
like what am I going to do since next time like if if the if this thing continue then
ya itu lah funny times lah right now it's the funny funny times
ya
oh okay okay ya ya ya
oh ya ah

singapore music scene where you know all the like sony rivals the band like they have
their songs on like movie soundtracks like like twelves storeys ah mee pok man all that right then
ya so I finally get to watch all those movies lah ya I ah that's what I've been doing lah all the nights actually
ya catch up on my on all all the old things that I've missed last time like like uh when
during the nineties era what happened right like music scenes in singapore
so through movies lah then I I I I I watch lah that's that's what I've been catching up on lah actually ya
ya

okay ah okay
okay
mm mm mm
okay okay
okay
okay lah full name mohammad haikal bin hasani can just call me haikal lah so err
actually what what I had planned for this year was
okay
I was in the I was doing err project management in their construction line lah
ah
yes
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response lah
and the
ah ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times lah so
then err
err when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
it was just a job for me
uh it's just a job for me to pay the bills lah
and ah just to
to to to earn to earn money lah
most of them they further their studies
ah
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay ah just go go go ahead with it
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree uh which
is related to my work lah so err maybe err err few years down the road err
down my career path lah in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
oh okay err I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up uh civil engineering ya ah
err
it it it
err
it's related lah but
uh not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the err engineering aspect ah it's more to the project management side
it was just like ah
ya
so ah
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now lah
even before during my poly I went for my err internship
so it was during my internship that that made me err think twice to to join the construction industry
err it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
ah
the working hours the nature of the work uh the work environment
err err ya
err
just sharing my my my experiences lah
okay okay mm
ya they attach me to a local construction company
err so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries lah or you can see a big difference between a local company and err err foreign or multinational company lah
I err in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that lah so I was attached to a local construction company lah
ah the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a ah
a
everyone in the office was so busy with their work

in their office ya that was that was how I felt lah
it's a it's a foreigner I think ah he he's an indian guy
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy
ah
so ah
he was the first guy who acknowledged me
ah
abeh ah
the project manager err then the project manager
on that day on that day ah
uh I think every every everywhere you work lah every month they will have a progress meeting ah
so the
so
ah okay for now you
you just follow my engineer
these big drawings construction drawings
err the size
this ah project lah
so
that that repeated for maybe two or three days ah
who who was was I was supposed to
to follow
so okay lah and then
he literally
ya ya I am ah
ya err
I'm I'm the I'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
ah so ya
the only
err the higher up
once a month ah just for the meeting ah just for the progress meeting mm
ah ya ya
so ya then err that that was it lah
it's like maybe err five five workers five staff or five to six ah mm
he's from uh
ya
ah ah ah
so ah and ah this ah
organisation he he he is a student from this err organisation ah
err
err the the students from china during the err
try try to
err like err
mm
uh
what um what's the
ah ya ya ya ah
err err like
ah language barrier and
err in in his own world lah
err err
ah ya office hours ah
stay back at work sia
then
only then you understand
what he meant ah which is true ah which is true ah ah ya ya
this industry like this is the work environment that I'm gonna be in
err
err wasted kan
err in this industry just just to just to have a job ah just to have a job and just help out help out the
uh pay the bills have part of the family ya which I which I did lah then
err
this thing
there were also doubt in my mind lah
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages ah it's not it's it's no longer
err that time was like what
early twenties lah kan early twenties
then you literally work your way up ah
but at that point
didn't didn't thought had that in mind lah
ya so
err
ah like
and it also ah
you need to have some technical knowledge lah which I was lacking ah
err with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking ah
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad ah
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas lah
so
ah
oh okay
mm ya ya
so ya err
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
ah consultants usually they provide the technical err aspect ah
so err when when when whenever you
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
what I
what was more on the soft skills
but
ah when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it lah
ah
a a
a degree lah then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
err previously was unisim now they call it ah
ya so
then you decided not to
okay ah
good for you lah good for you I mean
ah ya so
I took up
err my part-time degree
oh everyones
at that time ya like
really take up a degree in what really interest you ah
mm mm
ya
in the industry because your industry uh
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
uh with the the the
bosses like
doing this long term
like ah so like
uh we are a big
and then they got their directors lah and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy ah
like sometimes the conflict like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally ah living a comfortable life ah
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to
under production ah
under it's under ah
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa time is like you you will feel the time pressure lah
like you are running out of time ah so
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
we are are we
pick up another three years of study
at that time was
was so was want to
ah there's this
err
it's called a ah
and then the new zealand err working holiday is is a visa lah basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
err the visa is for six months
err
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
uh is that horticulture industry lah
reservist dah approve
the more money I have can save up the more money
so this early this year when COVID everything happen eh like
only god knows what I was feeling ah at that time like
oh singapore at at first
ah ah at first
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders
so like
for the first two months like that one
ah april ah
yes yes uh huh
at that time when when the the the
the news was was at at its height eh like
got diagnosed positive COVID positive ah and she was seated like ah three
three or four tables behind me which is
you have a lot of things planned already eh any like for everything to come crashing down eh it's really disappointing ah ah but
err at that time we just ah
ya but then err then
after that things happen

mm
mm normal
crazy as always
err
ah of course
what's new
just can't wait for my colleague to come back
then I can
back to her
too much
sue me or anything
it's true just stop then
like I just have to shut down and then restart
but yup and then
okay lah but I I manage
to like like go for good dinners um
on wednesday and yesterday so wednesday I went to Poulet
ah

Poulet and then um
ya err because they just got halal right
so ya Poulet just got halal
like I think a week ago

I got like
ya and then um
and so wednesday I went Poulet and then thursday I went to
okay lah I mean I'm one of them lah but
it's true right
ya
I don't know I like the place because of that that water fountain thing
ya I just
ya and then I love the the the the atrium because
I can just blend and sway with them you know
just keep swaying just keep swaying
but it's closed now because of that christmas they have that christmas
display or something like you have to spend
thirty dollars to
yes
yup
so I did spend thirty dollars just so that I could enter the atrium
and then end up not going to the atrium
it was on my A&W and err I I got a drink after that or
ya
like basically you just need to spend thirty dollars and then err they will allow two people to enter
ya
so that that was my week lah
I mean those are the highlights of my week

with my work with my work music you know
ya and then um ya lah err yup yup yup
it's just that ya I was a little scared that
I went over my weekly limits of going out

until what time that kind of thing which is surprising but
ya

so
isn't too much about it mm okay let's do this let's like ask weird questions
ya
okay lah maybe not weird questions but like
you can give like out of this world kind of answer
okay
like
if you get to
be on a rocket
and we are out of earth
kan
hais
but why would you want to do that
mm
okay but mm
so back to my question it's like if you ya if it can be in a rocket and then you're out of the earth
where would you want to land that rocket
and what would you be doing
out of that rocket
yup
mars

why is it raining knives
oh my god really
oh
seh and the fact that I watched the video clip and I didn't I didn't really realise it's nice
okay interesting
mm I think I want to go to neptune
because I saw a photo of it once once or maybe a few times because I follow NASA on
Instagram
yes because they
they will share all the beautiful pictures of the planets in the milky way and the black hole
calming colours for me alhamdulillah
ya it was and then
then mm
I don't I've okay I've never read into what neptune is made of so of the I mean they're all made of gas but
I'm not sure of the
composition of it
mmhmm
I don't know I've always like places that you know brings me calmness
ya and then maybe I can just be there and just be square because neptune's circle
square this this is
no no don't
yes okay ya
okay now your turn answers stupid random I don't know funny ya just just out of this world kind of question ya you you just have to be
we'll just have to be creative something
don't roll your eyes on me
mm
I thought we did this before no
I don't know
a giraffe yes
always
but no ya I always find they are
or at least my encounter with them the first time was that the giraffes were very cheeky
and I thought that represented me a lot
cause ya I'm quite cheeky and then
ya they're just magnificent animal
and I think
I don't know they they kind of stand out
ya
I know you properly ya
ya ya ya ya
it's just over there

when the
like
look at things because their eyes are just on the other side of

mm
survival lah
but why would you need that
why would no
back stab is like not
not even a literal meaning seh

okay if you can be anything
at all in this world
having anything or everything
what would you be
means like no restrictions at all I can eat anything can be anything in this world what would you want to be
you can be anything is this world what would you want to be
I want to break free
why would you want to be a non-living thing of all things I think even non-living things want to be a living thing
it's a privilege
they don't get a choice
they don't get a choice it's like something else is
doing he choice for them ya they can be anything and a lot of things but
they never ever get to choose
be something useful
apple tree providing apples to the world
no but seriously what what would you wanna be you don't know
okay
what do you mean
I guess a person with no limitations lah
if I can just
ya okay that will be one thing but like also in terms of helping people
ya I mean
spending that much
ya ya ya ya ya ya
just
almost good in everything

lie there then after that I say okay so um it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay lah my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
and um
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try lah two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
watching the show and then um second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like astaghfirullahalazim she was like

mm
mm
alah that one
um
okay lah but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
ah
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing lah I want to grow up I want to become
um
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course lah that
um
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why eh oh I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no lah no lah no lah it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got err theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful lah
and I wasn't doing very well in eh no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry eh no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
uh attended this lah you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that ah so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay lah give you more job ah then now I started learn
um
uh
like other skills lah like I've got to learn more about it
teaching then after now now I realised what is my purpose lah
mm
oh you went to watch that one ah ya it wasn't my first show lah but it was the first show that probably you watch
mmhmm
okay
mm mm
mm
ah ah
ya I mean I I love the show ah really I really help her but then
wah this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more uh but ya got big issue lah that one until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice lah it's really about you say lah your marketing
to win your audience um
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
mm then how you guys do it
mm
mm
let's try one of these prompts lah ha
mm
okay
okay
they always sell the masala chai in um
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in dollars
the chai but in that cup the big cup huh can I I say ya ya ya
I I don't know I'm just addicted to tea lah so but I like ah masala chai ah you like tea right
um
chai basically is tea what
delivery alamak
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not uh okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
err
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival lah but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
huh what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one eh washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no lah but it's it's it's buy one get one free what
ah okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
uh okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mm if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
oh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
oh
on purpose
why ah
oh eh okay okay
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill uh I want uh
um
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will lah ah
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move ah
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie ah a fighting film ah
cool lah but mm
and I don't like to fight ah
ya but then no lah I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
eh you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no lah just uh uh uh generic
um a lot of the but uh just basic ones lah very introduction to all the different therapies lah
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can lah you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay lah two weeks right
but some people they might say that
eh
dare to ask me we're not even that close um you know
you know
um
we take that example is not a very good example lah like one uh like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
um
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that lah but then
in the end um
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that ah so it's very uh and I err so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around ah you know it made me feel uh like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel um
that
uh you feel lah
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that lah I
if you could pick up your own stuff
um
would you be doing it lah am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well lah okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay lah you ask me then I can say yes I can say no lah
ya it's like a demand kan to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how ah how to
balance that out I try to figure it out lah
ya but won't
mm
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
mm
mm
ya I see hard ah
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
um
but you are following your dreams kan
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
so formal
who do you speak with usually
mm mm
that
that's not real lah it's not the code is not the what to say
mm mm
language
mm
mm mm
mm

uh
ya I remember I saw the vinny guy lah and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him ah
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at shu then I was like eh
maybe we just go closer look ah then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like um you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
err
and straits times so I was like thinking oh shoot I should have like told shu about it lah cause shu is always searching for
like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to err
like at least advance ah cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous
do you know that shura is like two years older than me right like she's like my age right
wait that's this is a good question would you ever date someone younger than me
ya
I'm twenty four this year
I'm twenty four lah
and you're almost thirty
ya
no as in
you're twenty nine years old this year would you date her
what the heck
I can tell that you have uh very very no filter
my goodness
and that's something a fact that I wish I could change
err when she want to move ah because the house is bought
but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
eh no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
showed me and mum the other day when I was at her house
because nobody loves you

going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there

can I come the next day
and that stuff
nazri
I can tell I can tell that you you
wow so deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from shura and all my other female friends as possible
mm no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
mm mm maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
is the liberal one is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
oh my god reminds me of the remember when um
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that um
we noticed there was a lot of err people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
jia hui jia xing eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember um
so mister jamal he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
trumpist I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter ah I have no idea lah that trumpet players ah like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world lah like he told us that
err he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because err back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown lah
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that ah
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in err chicago lah
so he would play the trumpet and then his
um his
friend would play the piano
so err I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior lah who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister jamal right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this ah
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts lah
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
err the
like the ah because he was wearing those
err
football jerseys ah like those what cowboys ah patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of kasanaz I'm sure you remember kasanaz
so kasanaz's husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer ah to the point that
they live in singapore but by right kasanaz doesn't need to work
kasanaz is like apparently like got money kind of like girl lah but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something ah like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time ah
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
kasanaz knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that wei xiang is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like wei xiang first of all right
you and me ah
ah both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university lah
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense lah since you like you
somehow educated lah most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties ah who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs ah
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the err the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in lah
so ya lor
I believe he's just a cashier
mm
you know err he used to intern for supply chain for
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
err so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company eh you intern for like a really
big
err
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay lah no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip ah
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also ah
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example temasek right temasek holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance err teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with temasek then we were like bonds ah
you know shares right you can buy like hundred ah
yes so it's really like you need to have money ah
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away lah but
it's a bit sad lah like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan lah the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years ah I have one lah
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money mah and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents ah cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad lah quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what lah those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever lah so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane lah like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue lah
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome ah
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
err
wei xiang was quite a
like not say an advocate lah he was quite a
this at this
restaurant at this then wei xiang didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists uh near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat meh with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no lah so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was uh didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the uh boyfriend was studying ah architecture or something ah
and then the boyfriend he's err
he's got money lah he's rich I forgot what the father does ah
err the father quite strict with the money ah
like I remember the father once said that
err got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten lah then the father got so pissed the father said
err
since you on the aircon after ten right err ah your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
um divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings ah
I don't know
I don't know lah
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so wah talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go jakarta one
second thing right they always go jakarta on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
jakarta right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
dubai or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
mm go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money wei xiang give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them ah but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can lah one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no lah you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be dee kosh
don't prey on kids
seriously dee kosh is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
err okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew lah his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me eh raf want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called lah then he was like oh my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking dee kosh then I'm like huh what you dee kosh wants you to model for him ah he's like no dee kosh wants to suck my then I'm like
eh wait wait wait wait wait eh you don't anyhow hor
then he show me the like the text lah so I was like
you're this guy is insane eh you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am dee kosh your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like oh you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that um
like then later on he'll be like oh like err
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars lah
no obviously I don't know dee kosh I'm telling my friend that
no so um I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal lah hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid lah there are apps and all these mah
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these lah cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people mah like
no one agreed to this ah and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this ah so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as uh you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
a'ah the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said ah is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal lah you can't like solicit sex for cash lah I believe
that is
wrong lah like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong lah I don't know how how wrong it is lah in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due err not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not lah
I don't know right is not a good enough um
answer to to evict you from like err
like
a a sentence ah it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone err he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
err with drugs ah that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge lah he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious meh for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's err it's not a good enough err like what you call it
defence ah the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right ah
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
err lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine lah like the person cannot say because the person lied mah
and the person tricked you into it but dee kosh I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that oh I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only mah
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly lah but like people like
influence ah
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific lah social media influences ah
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle lah
that's between the followers and them ah some people will like ah it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and ah you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense ah like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this lah but we don't empower him to do the things he do mah
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram ah Instagram empowers him lah Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things ah
nicole choo
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is ah the world evolves in this way lah so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition lah everything like happens because something happens mah
so like it's just evolution lah like something ee the previous generation must have done right has created this lah
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it lah I feel like I created monsters
which is true lah I remember she was the first
real socialite lah because before kardashian there was her what
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich eh like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite ah she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families ah like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
um
uh can't really think of any other people like right now lah but
and all of course all your shakes ah
how do I put it lah like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it lah it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes ah to tell people like what they're doing is wrong lah if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it lah like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste lah I personally don't like any of these people lah like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like oh there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no lah I mean if I'm
err I'll go down to town and buy it lah if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges lah what I put inside my bag lah my house
tour lah how much money is in my bank lah my mother underwear what colour lah
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives lah they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in err
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life eh when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
err
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is ah it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling ah
no lah the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

okay hi azli yes and we both of us are um married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say oh automatically I said yes one so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like ah because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
uh condo credit card car and whatever the C lah but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like um like what you want to do when we get married
will be like oh no this one lah
he cannot I already mah so you say that you end up
so when that time when um it was my turn right um I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like um does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually um proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up ah that time we were already like twenty seven I think
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like uh knows um a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
ha decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah
because of the and the right that one all um we we prepare ourselves yes uh I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
uh we all all our by ourself lah
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like um they say it in um
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them ah then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think uh we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars eh I was about to fork out everything eh to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't eh I was actually thanks to
ya because I trust them so much
but then uh at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because uh it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give lah but that time
ah ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways uh it actually works I print exactly lah that's why ah you got extra correct so that time
so uh eventually after that we that's not the only problem ah during our wedding ah actually my greatest fear for uh
quite popular in suria also and uh he's one of the funniest guy ah I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out alah
ya wasted sia it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like walao not on my wedding lah sia
but before our wedding there was this uh issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free lah contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better eh best eh until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also uh still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel lah so shout out to azuri and then um
ya our our wedding take place azuri azur but uh the his name is azuri
okay
so ya okay so
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
ya
is very much um
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy err better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya
okay so ya make it a drive all right so um is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage ah the wedding ah
oh ya the weather it was nice ah
mm
ya
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
eh
ya
mm
ah
mm
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing ah for you ah for me the luckiest will be the photo ah no no not the photography the photography was good ah the no ya
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing ah that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of um crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
kan ya so just to ask you again but um
we go through like a lot of stuff lah eventually until now even though it's
ya
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
uh marvels uh
um some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
is travelling kan
mm
ya
chey that was a punishment though
eh
I don't know eh oh I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me ah I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry ah because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also lah
no lah but then but
ya
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then um like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that um we wanted to do lah
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
they do their own way marriage lah
ah so that's why lah
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so um
can I just ask you another question ah before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me lah
mm
eventually he is like one okay guy lah so okay lor okay last question
last question lah I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me ah
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding ah marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity uh I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault ah it's your fault but then um there's no such thing as tercheat ah
ter ter there's no such thing as that one for for what I know lah
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me lah
ya correct ah then about uh then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people ah that one
uh never give me stress also because like the thing is that um in-laws right
okay lah still got we we there was a bond there ha and now uh we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
uh we want to create our own family here lah ha
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future um request
as a husband towards me for
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years lah we are already in our
oh my god do I know this
okay I think uh because um for the last past five months eh five years I have been like driving you crazy kan okay the thing is that um
okay ah I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family lah like another um junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that uh another person ah in our family lah kan
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so um I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually uh know
about you more lah
because of the time lah if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that uh to me
I like cooking lah not really into cleaning up ah he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya kan
okay so um that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about

ah
which is just a piece of wood
julie also was like okay lah
that's what my mum was texting ah ya she's like that right you know right
and this is one of us
but how you want to justify it doesn't
false declarations no was dry
daddy bear
he wants the freedom
because
is it block leave or clear instructed
oh you got your zoom ward meeting
okay
what hospital
it was initially ya it stopped I could have done it I could have done it lah but then because tonight my wife works night shift so she's gonna go to work at roughly
no they got time limit so when you book your time right it's one hour when you book then you don't want to go always right waste time but I didn't but that time when I went was okay lah but it's a it's a service free
one room I mean I just bring my wife so we can still hang out with my friend ah yay do the what first ya
no no no no I still need to send it to let them go and
so like most of us will be there lah I think it's suraya
could be five I'm not too sure depends on what language they speak on that day I mean I actually grew up with it what my mum
my guy I got one I think I I got one ah
british guy
he's from fulham fulham
salad singapore I want to do the salad
no oh my god he is he is kind of two left feet actually ya but that's the thing I feel like he's like he he okay like two left feet but then I think he plays soccer actually he he plays soccer so ah the thing is that they said he started coming like more often ever since circuit breaker I think like his normal amateur soccer games or whatever is like so common nowadays so that's why he every saturday will be there for training
so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
ah supposedly there is lah but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad lah ya
what
huh
hais can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then
so that's where I learn photoshop lah but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school
and then after that because I I know the whole I know the whole family lah yeah because after that I I found out from my mum that actually
yup I forgot why the brother passed away but it's really sad ah then I only found out cause after he passed away then he contact no lah
only one only one one one of my girlfriends
yeah she was a good friend lah we've been friends now I think twenty odd years twenty one years
but now we we talk to each other lesser
ah I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me lah
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me
ya in a way I mean in a way like if you want to talk bad about me so be it lah I won't I won't lose sleep over it
ya
all going out for supper party not all all thank you
she can speak chinese what then trilingual
K bye swee ling
papa bear and aunty bear go for breakfast
so mama bear not in all the bears go out today
went already what just now ya he was in office
ya which you quite elated right because of how he looks
ya the company closed down what company is it ah huh
oh jamco
jamco I think
because that time one of like because one of my classmates he's like working for those kind of companies kan the engineering stuff and then he didn't see that they are going through retrenchment soon or something like that at that point of time during our exam so like very busy
why really what you watch big bang theory big bang theory not really
uh
the only the only constant is change
I know ya the only constant thing is change
it is do you do you restart
let's say you were not actually doesn't matter lah
no no no what I meant doesn't matter is just okay did you apply through the app
any customers yet
no no one has reached out to yellow door yoga
Y D Y
yellow door yellow door Y D Y Y Y yellow door
come to yellow yoga
balance
can there's a lot of people doing it so you got to be ya you find a niche what
got no cases what
oh are you hungry
no I have not
well my wife say she'll wake up in the morning for breakfast but apparently she didn't wake up
ah no it's like that
so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
but that one starhub what I don't know
oh
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to lah have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy lah you have to but this one because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
very actually laggy lah the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this one but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software err no it's in english
of course of course it is still on I mean cable cable in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch per say when is the last time you watch
or cinemax or
okay lah
you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course lah
so you have to go down to go to the thing
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language uh
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
it's in
latin form ah so
which one
oh ya
ah no because in october
so because the people the colleagues so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
siala no I just I just told her you try december lah no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay lah november december
I don't know lah but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply lah said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't lah cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on lah even with our colleagues also some of them also huh what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on
it's been awhile already
it's been almost two years since I did it
no when she came she actually asked for malay speaking officer then I was like then I'm like eh malay speaking
malay speaking
why seh
then I went
yvonne
something like that
I'm hungry
orh
um but I think
they will change I think
I mean okay lah that one I let people go to the extreme
sabo sabo king
err
but daddy bear actually could ah not really cause the one outside technically the switch is inside yup no the thing is it is cold then just shift lah maybe your side is what you you're technically under the vent oh ya actually she cannot if you think is no I never honestly why would I touch it's there ya ya here so that time like julie did ask me like but I was doing work
okay what are you doing what's this how come you are logged in oh okay
eh what's the
not him right who I don't even know okay I really don't know who is shankar khan you really got me lost there
oh you got meeting today oh I didn't know today is today ya too early lah you
damn I will I think I will buy something later you want anything no breakfast
no I'm on a
speak of the devil
twenty that day also I
I can't even I can't even smell the lychee
eh my mother in law went out to geylang
uh or maybe it's your earpiece
oh wow oh why
isn't this like also wrong like in a sense that if you trying to show
wear niqab

ya lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
oh
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
err you want me to countdown
eight nine eight seven six five four three two one
happy new year

mmhmm
mm
uh it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's uh the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer lah
then uh I have there's a whole checklist of things lah that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
err groceries she have to go to a few uh supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing uh all within her area
so it can be like anything lah depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually err
err do a survey on the product pricing
mm
mm
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result lah responses ah
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say uh one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more lah three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred lah is only but it's the pay is good lah for that time
outlet kan then um
ya
uh price about it it's the same lah because it's the same retailer pe
and then err I had uh my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper lah like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience eh
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything what at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so err it was interesting then after that err
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them lah then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya lah but then no choice what and then is this this is like uh you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also uh
they they know that mean their their company already inform them lah like
maybe informed the manager lah not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing lah they don't say like mystery shopper lah maybe surveyor lah
ah they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one uh uh a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
mm
then too bad lah then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know lah that this week uh got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
uh customer service you know that they can give but then uh other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that lor
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
one year eh
mm
oh my gosh
mm
it's like part time ah
oh
wow
okay
mm
mm
just nice
mm
ya lah
that's why
mm
mm ah ah
mm
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
mm
ya but
wah that's nothing new lah because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game ah
mm
mm
mm
and then like uh my friend was saying ah like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good lah
ya lah no it's more than ten I think
mm
true lah
ya lah
mm
ah
mm
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
mm
oh
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance ah like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only ah
ah
mm
orh
ya lah
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
mm
mm
oh but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
mmhmm
huh
ah
wow lucky sia
hmm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya lah
oh ya
ya ah
mm
ya lah like they have to save cost lah if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like uh reduce the
the
the rental right ya lor
mm mm
why
mmhmm mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
mm
oh my god
mm
mm
oh so interesting
mm
oh
ah okay
mm
oh
ya lah
mm
ah that's smart
ya lah
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders eh
mm
ya lah ya lah true
mm
oh he's staying alone now is it
mm
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
mm
ya lah true
ya lah ya lah
mm
but it's good lah I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also ah
and then uh we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in eh
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see lah like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then uh don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking lah but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin ah so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and uh and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel uh travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know lah but my whole company is like they freeze travel lah
like for to do travel booking lah visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
mm
mm
ya lah crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing lah basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter eh
from like ah ah headhunter agency eh no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
mm
mm
ya lah
kan I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight ah I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got uh really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya lor makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is uh four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can lah wei cause uh like more senior level lah like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky lah they get a very easy boss
with
eh you never know you know my previous company there's this one err uh E old she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do lah
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
ah yes yes yes they say golden handshake lah but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department eh
because obviously you are being paid too high lah and people have eyes to see what so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall lah like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every uh I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
uh
oh my gosh ya lah she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive lah because she's such she's so rich eh
mm
ya lah
mm
ya lah that's why I was like uh oh my gosh like so some people are so lucky
oh she's been there for a long very long lah usually those uh who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
mm
mm
really ah
mm
mm
ya that time my friend got told me the uh one of her experience kan
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority lah the the boss will give her the supplementary card eh but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever lah whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her uh eh later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like wah so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool lah like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
uh ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's uh he already ask me to pass you I was like
mm
ah ah
uh huh ya
oh
mm
mm
mm
wow
mm
mm
huh
oh my gosh
mm
mm
mm
ya lah at least can just must tell him right
ya lah irritating because usually when they travel it's uh company what so but they can accumulate their own points
haiya
ya lah
oh
mm
mm
ya lah that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing one then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one ah
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right ah okay then we can get the cheapest ah like more less less risk
ya lor
mm mm mm
cannot lah cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because uh it's I think oh that one is because the name
the name is uh typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating seh because we went back and forth then I was telling them like uh when oh no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button ah
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one ah the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name what I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly what
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like oh shit
auto fill so uh I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill lah
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay ah I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited ah no show ah
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
mm luckily like promotion and cheapest eh
oh I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling eh and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then uh after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others lah uh there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight oh
from the company uh book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together ah
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic sia but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore ah
ya lah
kan
ya lah true lah
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane eh
I was like no I just inform the finance uh girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya lah
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
ho chi minh ho chi minh
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats eh no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular eh
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday eh
ah
mm
oh ya ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
so he take ya lah ah that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team kan
no huh
after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious ah but okay lah
after that my friend was like eh I cannot book then I was like eh I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still uh showing available
mm
mm
oh no wonder
mm
mm
eh like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like wah
every time I do travel like so messy seh
ya but it was very funny uh but now now that the travelling stopped for awhile right I think when once it start again I need to refresh refresher courses
mm
ya lah mm mm
ya
mm
mm
oh
ah
hmm
you mean I can just call them and ask
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
then I buy ah urgent visa lah which cost like I think four hundred over dollars eh
I think hong kong or somewhere lah that is a chinese uh I mean a a locals asia PAC ah
not china leh we seldom go china what it's hong kong not
philippine
uh this type of country uh
oh vietnam maybe vietnam passport
passport ah I think passport right
mm
and he doesn't need to like I think it's quite recently that they changed the countries eh
the countries that uh can my must apply visa cannot apply visa on arrival he say last time when he when he go there he straightaway apply visa on arrival it's like no issues
kan
hmm
ya lah
then he was asking me so err did I get my visa already
aiyo
ya
I don't know
ah ha kan
the one with the censored one or the correct one
haiya
hmm but it's fun lah I mean I mean it's it's quite nice lah
mm
ya lah
that's why it's like but I'm just very thankful like so far up up till now it's still okay lah but I'm just say I'm just
counting my days lah I won't be lucky forever I'm just
ya lah
kan
mm
ya lah whether I can whether they will survive or not if they survive I survive ah but like suddenly if they ask me to leave then how
mm local
that's why it's
so should I find a job or not should I apply for a new job or what
ya and then maybe if something comes up
right
ya lah ya lah that's why just go and find only lah ah
just
but like not in a desperate need lah like just send out first and then uh see if like got interview just go and then you know like keep the options open in case

travel is more expensive than food like I would I would choose travelling like my travel travel expenses is fully paid ha

then what's your cheat
kan
mm
mmhmm
the
cannot stack means ah me and you together pay together cannot so I have to pay my own personally you have to pay yours personally ya lah it's like that lah
so that means if like if you pay seventy five you pay eighty dollars then it's not worth it lah

then I say then I say you cannot compare it that ah it's different what
and then

but the thing so if that's why it's more expensive but it's the same price kan
halloween horror nights and
halloween horror night sis
sis scared
ha
ah
mm
but people say that is tone of he scariest one ah
sabah sabah got voodoo shit
but I thought voodoo is that more like turkish thing
is it correct
what
remember like we wanted to go then the ticket was like thirty plus right
mm
D marquee D marquee
I three I remember ah jian cheng say lah ah
hmm
hmm
hmm
inviting
okay I have this question ah like for example kan okay when
for them
but
I heard from some people like that
is it
I don't know you steal
okay imagine
their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing what
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya lah then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya lah then how to bribe
ya lah
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
mm islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own
allah is allah won't judge you once
a chance to
mm
mmhmm
a'ah lah
so he went to
so I so I I thought I have this conversation lah so
good person
sinners
sinners who repent
ya lah
plus point
so allah is fair like that allah love us in a way that way lah I think that's how I think islam to me islam is a very loving religion ah a very loving very empathetic
compassion
society
first thing society ah
ya
that
true
my expire date is thirty first july two years after this
ya lah
perfect
ya maybe we
you meet american union people start a
step good good
hmm
what do you mean
ya lah
ya
to
wanted to know you wanting to know you ya because
then because
err ex hafiz
and she received a lot of from guys lah
so people added her
she gains more attention by that
ha
no
no
for what
because ya
so sis feel that
hmm
then
I tried what once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say lah because when I see a people a girl wearing niqab err I have expectation on them ah
a'ah lah
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
no wonder lah you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief lah like I wanted to add lah that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear ah
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering jer
a'ah
mmhmm
big
big build ya
ya
then how ah
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that err
because we will be looking so dull
still
what's the word ah the the the
ya ringarde I don't want to be ringarde
but
ya lah
true lah
and the creator
ya so like
like being fashion
being looking like
ya
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
you just want to

friends lah I I know it's important but then uh friends that can can I think I mean can really together sit with you uh uh I mean like you can share things together
oh yes uh I'm more like want to have a peace of mind lah just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think uh because uh we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this uh the ten years time is to whereby I would like uh you know um
um
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
ah ah ah like for you how
there will be new one I let go
um
mm
mm mm
mm
so meaning that ah
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty lah so at that age you
you still want to like uh you know pursue your interest
uh in science
okay
mm mm
okay
uh if there was a drama kan um I mean I like to watch action movie lah actually
ya cause action movie
working but then you you
you really like um awake that means you're really awake and you are like uh
you are you are really amazed you know amazed
ya stimulated and you are really amazed by their their skills lah
ah
yes correct uh correct
scenario settings uh you know once in a while okay lah once in a while ya
how about you
what kind of uh genre did you like to watch
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay okay
mmhmm mm
mmhmm
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no lah that one is different question
mmhmm
uh I think fit body lah better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina uh you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors lah okay I mean like everyday life also lah we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important lah
yes correct correct
ya correct of course um of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks uh you know ah people say you have it's naturally
it is naturally lah like that
so what will you think
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ya
ya so you see eh like nowadays generation you can see the different generation eh how they are very um they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
but then they they they always ah you know
that is only external but not internal you see ah this is what they they forgot lah so I think um
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm okay because I think about mental health ah it has to be
uh
ah that any friends that you think that uh that support you and any friends that you that uh you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself lah whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
ah at least at least you have uh somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming
mmhmm mmhmm
ah
mm
mmhmm
correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm
mmhmm mm mm
I think ya it's true it's true I think that um okay when you talking about the schools eh um
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being ah they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
can take the stress so you cannot push them further lah
ah because ah
correct
correct
correct
ya
correct correct
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya lah ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
where would I want to go
mm
children days are really a a days that memorable days lah I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like uh like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of uh like childhood memories lah childhood fond memories but like as for me
uh as a kid ah ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep ah that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody lah have their own good childhood memories
so how about you
oh okay
mm
mm
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
mmhmm
um
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
mm
mm
uh three wishes eh
um okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is uh
a healthy life lah
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then um
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children eh when they are in need children in hunger ah you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think um a bit sensitive to their situation
okay then the third one the third one the third one uh the third one
what is it ah third one ah
mm
like for me right I think the other wish is that mm
but um
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy lah healthy body and healthy mind
uh and then the the best part is uh good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good uh behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
um respect others
uh yes then um the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important lah
uh to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
I I just hope lah that my children are not like that and then uh I just hope that whatever that my children do they must uh always think that life is really temporary
uh in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there um
ah that is my my wishes lah I I think for my for my children
for my children
mm
yes correct no I mean uh of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
ah you see
ya no
mm
mm
okay
mm
ya
ya
there is uh good and bad lah we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first eh
see ah there there is a good and bad lah when talking about phones okay uh cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
ah you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy lah and everything information at the fingertips but
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
the I mean it's difficult lah to control it is more I think challenging
ah now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control ah you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy lah it's not really easy
mm it's not really easy
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
mm
ya correct
mm
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
ah so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
um you see
ya I mean mean of of course
mm
mm ah ah then after that
ya
ya
wah I think ah I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem

ah
mm
mm

mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
how much was your kurta
okay
still okay
mm
ya
escalator escalator
ya
so I had to win that game
mm
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games err and this just brought me back to
early times ah I guess
mm
um the game of life is basically
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
and then there was
mm
pick up sticks
ya
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
so
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
mm
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then eh ya
oh ya ya ya
mm
I
oh congkak yes
ah but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
congkak yes I actually really like congkak
okay
where it's like a kampung where it's design and and like err painted in a way that looks like a kampung so there was like hopscotch on the floor there were games here and there
ya err ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands lah so
mm
ya ya
mm
mm ya something like that ya ya ya mm
yes yes that one is like the spider spider plastic spider
ya that one never play before
the ya
how
okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya oh my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
mm
mm
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working ah full time right now um in an office I work in an office job for a business school
um so I'm just giving you a bit of context lah eh um I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's err and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
the company
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that err sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
but I think for now no lah
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business eh
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already um on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
um like her story
ah okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
my number one idol when it comes to business
err I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
err ya ya fenty fenty became
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya oh no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable lah so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products ah like companies that she made
like gave her so much respect in that
like err area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then um she also has
err like a luxury line which I forgot ah I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're wow this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business mm
I I think what success is
is like maybe lah for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
like I think to me that is success
mm mm
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
ya go ahead
yes
mm
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so um
um the account was giving seventy K seventy K
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus err the iphone new iphone
I
oh I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to err to um settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
wow fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty mm
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
mmhmm
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there lah but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell lah
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why ah you you ask me that before
mmhmm
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach ah and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
mm
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like oh I can afford this you know like so it comes with it lah
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
mm
mm mm
okay sure
mm
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
ah the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine
hmm
I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours
ya and we don't know if they are getting paid much more
ya in a in a in a way yes
go frontliners shout out
mm
you not actually nurse
I think you can
I think you will make a good nurse
I think you can
can you
no let's not talk about that but I don't have lah
okay
wait I wanted to share something but I think that's not best to be shared okay nevermind moving forward
mm nurse eh maybe maybe I don't think I would good news
ya true
do they have to go to medical school
to be a doctor
I don't know
wait what are we doing with our lives I think it's
doctorate lah
doctorate degree
mm
doctor fazil
doctorate
and doctorate is like
ya then he make fun of the people there early on he he's like he's like err
I believe there are some err owners here as well how you all get in this one have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further lah I don't know
like we generally don't know okay we're sorry but
general practitioner wow
ah ah
ya
ya ya ya ya
wah bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya like
err okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a err not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor banu doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
mm game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice
singlish err it's not that fun lah
it's okay lah
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
nice
oh well you manipulated me
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward err ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
um
no
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
mm food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
mm
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but um ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya lah we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference aww but err I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person ah but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
um like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like um
maybe some like close friends as well so
that
stress ah to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders ah it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and err
mmhmm
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
probably would put you in check a bit more
err but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
err I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you um sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

K um
there was this one time
there's only one time that I was actually I was just sitting at the chair then I wanted
I was so embarrassed at that point then when I left there I heard someone laugh ya allah

mm
oh goodness

err okay
mm
eighteen already

that happened then I'm like okay that's weird that's also actually quite embarrassed and I'm like okay

okay
alright
ah
tenet
okay ah basically he borrowed money without my knowledge
this is less still shady ah
I don't know who
thing is
what
whether
damn
ya
ya
ya
basically like he was caught in the crossfire lah
once in the
ah
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
you tell
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
last month last month not a lot lah close to one thousand
yup that's it ah
at least that's the only thing I know of ah
uh his credit rating is bad
I think he needed money ah
ya
oh that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
don't do this ah
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
you know right not the end of this month next month lah cause our initial agreement was six months what
uh next year
friend ah
no one listens to me kan
the voice of reason
ya
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care ah that kind of thing ah
ya
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
actually by end of this month
but
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
but
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed ah
rightfully so ah to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
you have a place to go but you rather not ah
that kind of situation ah
ya basically lah same thing ah
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it ah
but
now seeing this
you know
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend ah rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
I have
I have
eh
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know oh but
you know people are driven by greed what some people do not know how to control their greed
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you what
um
ya he left
uh some cash cause I don't know ah he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
mm
mm
ya
ya
alright
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap ah
okay
so
mm
sort of
fahim no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know lah whether
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl lah
I mean technically there is a plague going on ah
okay
okay
mm
mm
okay
hmm
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably lah eh
mm
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does tau maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
ah
ya ya like it it's inside lah and so it's called what you said is right correct pe
ya
why you were there lah at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
be a part of it lah cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend ah
um
in a moral dilemma every time
that
you know I don't feel good that she's there
it doesn't feel right what
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that oh I'm approving this ah it feels wrong ah
so it puts us in a tough spot ah
back then ah
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical farid lah
like shadow boy shadow boy
I think eight years
oh
okay
mm
what the
okay
hmm
loco ah
I wouldn't
know what
she's gonna be there
it came to a point where if riz there she's there
so we knew what to expect ah
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
um from what I see eh
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs ah maybe she fulfils both not sure
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here ah ah the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him ah
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks ah
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all lah definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
not saying that it's super common lah no lah just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
ah recklessness um
probably lack of ambition
ah ya privilege ah ya lah
usually
usually lah generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things ah
generally speaking ah
so based and on that
um
scenario like you always quite common ah for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible lah I'm not saying that
bad point would be
or fittest lah even
not not even the fittest man alive ah
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
oh did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already lah
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist ah
it's nonsense
ya
sial lah brunei
ya
mm
oh is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
mm
oh
mm
ya ya ya
okay let's just call them government eh
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism ah
for investment
attack tourism ah
yup that that's the thing
country
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia lah but still quite bad lah
if you look at the ah if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free lah it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
ah then uni isn't free
ya it should be lah or very heavily subsidise ah
but it's not okay ah let's talk about
oh so just now you wanted
to ask about
oh khai right
ya
anything lah
ya
oh
more
when it comes to that and
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her lah
too trivial lah to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
you know how we talk kan
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
something like that lah
oh mistress
well he consented to it lah so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know ah
then she slimmer
ya
if you want to do this
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out wai was the one who needed help
so ya
I mean that's why he deal lah him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant lah rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married lah if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her lah personally
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
ya probably yup
oh six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
fifty percent is fine what it's both of your kid anyway
ya
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it lah
the rest I have to iron
yes exactly
oh okay ah
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
safwan told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
his name is saifuddin
then zafran I think zafran has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her lah
so I don't know
oh when life is good
eh
I'm on a
the frequency of how how I eat
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult ah
huh
I ate at four
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
when we started going to the gym
ah still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on ah
healthy ah range
but ah same lah
a
ya louder that ah
true
didn't factor that in ah
sial lah
err should be more
actually should use the malaysia malaysia one
eh should be more accurate for malay
sial ah
ah yes
one six seven
you're going to do it now
of what obesity
ya average or healthy ah
ya
wah slightly above average ah okay pe
okay lah
chonky
ya I remember
I remember
absolute unit ah
I think the heaviest I was I think lah cause I didn't check my weight for very long time think seventy I think so then it was it was good lah that that I went for the christmas dinner
I should do something about it lah
then it was difficult lah initially very difficult
then
no no no no
yup
then food

why
why would you look at it
if you put it in album why would you look at it once in a few years
even if you put
you won't look at it everyday what
it's there but you won't look at it everyday

why cannot

they will have a special
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
that chemical

so ya
wow
oh interesting
um
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there lah almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
mm
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
um
ah mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
mm
mm
vegan
is is there a certain
mm
mm
I
don't have anything
because of all the free time
um
but actually um
in southeast asia
mm
mm
oh my god
mm mm
mm
mm
ya lah
born born to be slaughtered lah basically
mm
mm
and then
oh okay
start drawing again
err two thousand twenty one resolution
err come back to
I
but
by by time
mm
um
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home lah
ah fully on music then
work from home
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
mm
um
greek
I I
one or two language first lah before ventured out
mmhmm
oh my god ya
mm
mm
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
mm mm
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
a total shit show lah
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
mm
mm
mm what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya lah cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
mm
oh but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait lah
um
what else ah
if you go
the the
ah two thousand twenty one
a burst of
creative contents
this this cannot
um go on for too long I have I have to do something to
mm
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
mm
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
mm mm
natural selections
mm mm
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
mm
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
mm
duolingo
mm
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
mmhmm
mm
mm
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
a'ah
mm
mm
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
mm
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
ah
mm
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
mm
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature lah
mm
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
mm
mm
mm
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
mm mm
I don't have any other interest
and the new age plato
mm
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called ah the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
mm
the difference
I want to go to greece again
mm
oh in addition to that scandinavian countries
oh ya ya
sweden
oh yes denmark
K lah hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
mm
mm
in ruins
mm
ah you you cannot see with your own eyes
mm
running eh
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours wow
wah long silence very long silence
uh huh death to two thousand twenty
but I think it's a good mockumentary lah to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one eh two thousand twenty
mm
and
mm
okay lah if if you could
be your younger self
mm
you know what do you have against schools ah
uh huh
mm
mm
but for you most of that internet lah kan
I think that will help a lot
ah
mmhmm
this one is the beginning okay
mm very anti climactic
okay lah I like new beginnings um
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
oh
mm
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
um
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
mmhmm
ah
mm
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
mm
mm
that's my vaccine wah
mm
mm
ah ah I wish I wish we can talk about something new lah mm
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K lah thank you
okay

but it's not really budget what it's okay lah
ya
it's
in singapore
nobody is going to stare at your body lah
well to be fair since you so paiseh I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like err chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot chope seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty err
no the
are you sure he's the same age as us what
but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that dulan face
annoying sia he's going to give you even more dulan face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the err I don't know he's but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know ah the person is like the the nephew or eh no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue lah
ya ya
ya ya
ya
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you from behind you
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay lah
we
was it we dabao
no before we came before we ah err
I
ya ya
ya so is like
err what's that called it's nice oh but the indo food there is not bad also after
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten err ten every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years lah so she she scared already err ya
so had try lor try and walk err ten ten ten everyday if not like ya
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age ah then you look back at your at your food intake
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food leh she
no she has um err high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now what right like
last time he got juggle his intake meh
exercise ah
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty mah like the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
uh really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that one cannot I I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
mm
oh he cannot take because of this but he's fit what
ah okay okay
ya
wow okay that is quite sian cause like I see him exercise so much and err workout so much and then
ya sugar sugar level quite easy to maintain one as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff lah because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar what so ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know ah don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically lose the
ya
oh shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first uh like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why wow there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but oh ya oh wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was err what's that called ah
with like I think is a vegetarian meal lah so like
no like err there's err you know like those kind that looks like mala but I don't think it's mala it looks like err it's soya sauce so it has like
ya everybody now want to be in err healthy lifestyle err why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one err ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya and I and then we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like eh bo jio
no when people when people jio you you not like you will reply what
ya
not you lah I mean like other people people alamak
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online lah it's like everybody
but then some people will your life like
crazy it's scary lah if you ah used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we err
err
no the dress that I show you the the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot err
aiya
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very sian because I miss it ugh
it is it's available but it's like ugh
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like aiya
ah yes it must not be cause otherwise
err so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like for the black one can wear when we go out but then for the white one maybe wear to like wedding
err thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the white and black dress but it's like a lot ugh
err in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep mah
same
not not about options or design eh like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb ah
ya just
no lah it's not that it's not that jialat what
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years err if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one ah
for me
I think
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel lah if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
ha not so jialat like expand too much right err then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive one is like oh my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
oh let's go see err universal traveller the winter shop
I don't know where we can just go lah walk down the road are we still going to the rich and good cake shop
yes ah

oh wait I thought your sister went to eat before
because at bedok
ya so it it's a
no cause I see people posting the food it's like the stone grill beef so it looks very good it's like ya
really orh
oh last year
no oh ya and also the the other one the six six five
ya that was october ya
ya
I think ah everybody must be crazily booking all the tourist attraction now because of the kids who are all stuck at home and you cannot
is the is your sister one of those kiasu people who book way in advance
advance what
but she never book like staycay or anything meh usually if she cannot travel she will staycay what
expensive leh I tried checking for new year eve the staycay is expensive
ya
but I thought this year don't have they only have uh neighbourhood fireworks
ya it's like you staycay in town to have fireworks in the neighbourhood it's quite
really but cannot see fireworks what from orchard
ah ya lah but you know like
crazy siao like the the there there's this err new hotel called laguna work err it's a golf club lah so it's new
uh near EXPO like somewhere behind EXPO it's a golf club ah ah err so I was checking when they first open I think the room rates were three hundred plus to four hundred then I'm like that's expensive right
and then I check again it's six hundred six hundred
I mean fullerton bay six hundred is like okay but because fullerton bay is like in the middle of the is it called singapore river ya singapore river or sea whatever lah and err
what's that called
but this one six hundred golf club also got no view okay lah
eh but it's quite near EXPO and all the what's that place called ah changi city point
ya
no it's a is it hotel ya gold club ah ya like resort ah
why as in
uh ya
please lah crowne plaza changi is four hundred fifty for normal room
uh ya but also now no planes fly as in very little not like you can watch
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice leh but like aiya I'm not gonna spend that much that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong one they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia one and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in and obviously thailand is a standard one lah a
what we opening office in but they're gonna use err they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like cordon off and use it lah
but is
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not lah
eh I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open err an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
above table under table whatever lah wherever
ya but once we once okay lah not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
ah okay lah not immediately maybe you have to wait until like err I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so leh they say leisure
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't um like if you don't get tested then okay lah basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I ah you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in lah like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also has about what five hundred and twenty million people
that that day pedi said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free what to watch so like they um what's that called they were saying like err please do not travel and to minimise the spread ah the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at err it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are kiasu usually err kiasu kiasi don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
but you will immediately be fined what not meh
chey they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail meh like no no jail like
aiya whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a more serious
it's like how
the india one ah
no but look at
isn't it like err what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
ya
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small what even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five what
so you wear mask at all times at your table
ah that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like huh but we one person what what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone lah I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
that's true have you seen
the rest never mind lah
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that one
eh the the the khatib new err playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
khatib SAFRA ah ya the one uh jason went the the
HomeTeam khatib HomeTeam at khatib I told you before
uh ya but uh maybe not not when uh got menses
okay that one ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more
nope once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
err okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different lah I think you next time shouldn't
no
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like oh you're so caring I'm like what the hell
err
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite kaypoh what no meh
seriously
okay cause like if if
is it the fat boy anas
see that's why you have all these people writing in on like chinese page about how
not every wife wants to play game what
who is asking who like the
orh it works both ways
no what that's why if both parties have to have their own ah
so they
but
they don't talk during the game there but you
ya so wait you can hear you can hear them talking to their kid in the background while they're playing the game
okay
ah ah
ah
ah
okay
orh ya lah
okay
that is like what okay err
eh but surprisingly leh the SIM card that I got in turkey like when we drove for that god knows how many thousand kilometres it work
ah
ya
ah
ya
huh
okay
ya because the turkey SIM card was not bad leh I
ya you know what my brother tried my brother mind game with like how you play I don't know what he play lah we the a friend in singapore on the freaking van ah
he's like okay I'm gonna try and play games see whether the reception can or not I'm like can't you don't be crazy why you playing game when you're in turkey on the road and he's in singapore
yup so I think maybe you might do that if you go road trip
ya and the reception is terrible what like it will be unstable so like
ya lah you play you play for a bit you sleep for a bit and then you see how it is lah
ya
it's like oh I schedule a pap smear
I think in december I don't remember and also like err what's that thing called ah
flu jab
why ah
oh are they gonna rip me apart
oh
huh
what
no no I went to the toilet
but then again kan when you think about it kan err
I think
I I think
err you know our body has muscles there so technically it can stretch if you not forcing it like to stretch it ah
at your vagina or cervix
okay
okay fine that one government subsidy government government paid a bit right
government should pay full not pay a bit
err oh my god
ya the older people all have lah
oh ya ya the fibroid
right and then after that I'm like
ah
ya ah
everybody thinks like oh this person single mum is it
ya
siao lah
a spotify or
ah
ya
eh I talking about this um
I don't know whether I told you but err so like uh I watched Tiktok videos right so in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
but the thing is
ya I like why would you why would you be why would you give birth at fourteen okay lah but I think the is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
huh
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
ee but then it has no rubber at the side
ya
so it's like
oh no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
but it's just like I don't know it
err ya is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything
what had he gain
catch ball
next time just catch the ball don't catch the sperm

uh huh
ah
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents ah
mm
mm
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum ah
having disputes ah
ah ah ah
mm mm mm
mm
yes
grow up
ya
tense up ah ah
ya ya
fight ah ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing ah ya
ya ya
ya
a'ah
ah
probably probably ya
mm
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear lah ah if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why ah what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside leh you look soft outside and inside you are eh fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it ah
adamant ah
oh okay okay okay
ya
mm
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also lah
ya
mmhmm
ya eh you know what dude actually what right uh one thing you should actually I recommend lah you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book ah dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that eh no no some people actually uh you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique lah then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a wah dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what lah but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good lah
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook ah and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F ah
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel um wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the mats can walk like that or the bengs they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like whoa so big like they as if they got like big triceps ah that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also lah ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
oh really ah
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time lah ah
opening ah ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
a'ah then then then
I I think so ah why ah recall recall recall help me recall
oh ya okay okay then then then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
oi my memory very bad lah bro very bad bro mm
mm
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
ah
ya
ya
okay
something new ah
oo
okay ah
ya ya you can like transfer ah ya
okay
ha
flying ah mm
ah
okay
okay
okay
ya
mm
mm mm mm
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky ah that person should never have been a pilot sia but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
oh eventually they change lah when did they change
okay okay
mm
mm ya ya ya
okay
wah motivated like crazy sia
oh very young ah
ah
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
uh huh
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
mm
oh okay okay
mm
okay
okay
let go ah
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying ah you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly what okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay ah
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength ah ya ya ya
oh but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career lah it's more of like uh okay okay not not so much of a mistake lah not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
ah
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
ah
okay
ah
mm
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
oh
a'ah
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
mm
okay
this was when ah
how you afford all these things man operation lah go lah
you loan ah
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
oi okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room ah
but you're
ya
ah who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
eh that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know ah it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no ah
just a cross ah oh okay
no you know why because I don't know lah it depends on my future lah because for now there's a lot of changes ah okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
dubai right dubai airline is it
oh
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience ah
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that lah
ah
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit lah ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry lah the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts ah
mm
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal ah
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
mm
wah how many airplanes sia bro like that
wah I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue lah like from steward to be flying lah okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is uh my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
oh you went through the three months ah oh it was supposed to be that stage already lah oh
wah dude that time if you fly ah your inter pretty stable and nice ah bro four to six K easily sia
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike ah
ya ya
walao I don't think that's anywhere close sia
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there sia on the drone
okay
that's relatable lah
ah okay okay so it's just a matter of time lah
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of mumammad salihin
ya then eventually when people see the peak ah lah it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession eh but okay lah but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like oh crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum lah so ya but but but no lah I I wish you all the best ah brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it lah it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field oh
mm
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him ah ya like before him right you see bush wah everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him ah the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman lah
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics ah in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no lah bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back eh okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that lah but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead mah like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks what the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people lah the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have genghis khan you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them lah you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that um people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person lah how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now lah because if I go there I will die of boredom sia
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something lah but I'm not in touch with him that much lah
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old lah I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains ah then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom lah there's nothing to do sia there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know lah okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how sia
a plan ah
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business lah oh I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no lah basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay lah I will just give you a brief verbal presentation ah people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example oh bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why oh why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
ah
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much mah
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility lor
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay lah you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people lah okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole lah which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor lah okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk mah you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan lah okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets lah you know you buy Rolex lah you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there mah
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions lah your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong lah but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example ah they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government uh supreme court order you to pay lah like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone lah that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore ah
cannot ah
their their their passport is blocked what they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead lah you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go lah you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you uh they cannot lah they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay lah they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy ah so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna uh work in production houses if the company feel like eh there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you lor private entity what
ah so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
ah like this kind of job ah the one that is got profile one ah they normally will not hire you one
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system lah ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests ah
ya lah for example okay I give you a scenario ah let's say you owe ten thousand lah the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred lah
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month lah okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial uh the debt trap ah okay so the second way is to pay a minimum eh

um um I mean
one thing tom holland is
one thing okay
he's young so he really suits it but I feel like I'm much more um what you call this thing convinced by the portrayal of toby maguire as spider man is very subjective a lot of people will be debating about this
but I just feel like at the point of time your teenager he was out there
there was this other person also andrew garfield you know
ya so um he his portrayal wasn't as good as toby maguire
like there's a lot of err
I don't know whether you understand what I'm saying but
I mean he does have the face of like
oh my god when was the last time
mulan

err acting ah
err I'm re-watching friends over and over again can never stop man

personality personally I don't think it works though cause like okay one thing capitalism
um fridge

good share though will be interested to actually watch it on netflix
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
they will be tempted ah ya should shoplift in norway
what do you mean
uh ya
oh right right right
nice
ya then after that this year

things in your mind

ya
eh
uh um

exotic
how how much is his
damn son

and how do you feel about him taking a degree like
like
mmhmm
ya
I know girl
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh you went dark so fast
ya
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
sis we all struggling here ah
at least we are doing something about it right
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
ya
ya so like err ya so like now I'm like
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your taiji lah basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
ya then that will be his fault
ya
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year eh
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like you assume that the other person will know
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a err a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
err
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
boyish lah so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants ah so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically lah
I think we both know that lah
ya so just tell me what you want lah so in a way communication works
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm mmhmm
okay mm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya as long ah you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
ya
Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
oh damn
oh
muffin mitten oven mitten
is it the rainy day
its the rainy season
wow
oh my god I'm so annoyed with this trump and biden thing
cause like err back then like like few
ya and then like I have to like nudge him and say like you know like
communicate ah if you please wear the stupid earpiece please
I am the president
when he's he's not president
jer
okay
ah
uh on trump um surprisingly ah quite good looking guy
ya when he was like younger
ya
ya supposed to go to the office today cause every monday is a calling day so err but its raining so he I don't know whether he's gonna call at home I mean technically he can call at home its just that when you are at the office and everyone is calling you will be motivated to call right
so I don't know why they do calls on monday I mean mondays got monday blue as a customer as a client would you want to be called on monday for insurance like don't disturb me on monday monday is really lousy
ya but monday
wait he suppose to call you
orh
mm mm
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
ya ya ya
oh okay
is it because it covers slightly more I don't know
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
orh okay
okay
but if you terminate
orh okay okay
oh
this is under adam or your own
I know that is doing very well right now so that's why he's trying to get like um all his clients to invest in sector because Apple is coming up lots of stuff um a lot of people will invest in that and
ah mmhmm
mmhmm
side
oh oh
oh
UNICEF ah
ah ah that's the one
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
think you should work on your timings
short form
funny though
sorry but um yes err in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus oh not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically err I'm not sure which year
so
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them eh so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
that's it ah
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work lah
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
ah
its its definitely different lah cause um
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but um for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you lah
but
for me is is still okay cause
ya
uh huh
a'ah
ah
ya then they will be screwed up ah which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year
um I'm coming later
okay the thing is like when we wake up as a form teachers you have to take attendance so they will have to be in this like zoom call or whatever and then like
err there will always be this one or two people who never wakes up
it's like
ya and its like
ugh its still retained there in my mind so annoying
ya and
um in a way yes because like I don't have to like teach and I can chill a bit but the fact that I still have to go to work and I cannot travel cause it's the only time that you can travel right end of year to travel to like europe country um
that's it ah december holidays
I don't think you got book no book
to to to do you have the link
um mac birthday is next month she's been wanting to go singapore flyer mac
no no no I mean you can use some of it so I check already so senior citizen is like thirty something
adult is fifty
there goes my fifty
can ah
right you should be able to stack though
ten ten dollar vouchers that accumulate to hundred ya
but fifty dollars for a ferris wheel
ya she's been wanting to
oh well
um

my day um
then the queue outside to enter is so long cause right now is COVID right like you know
so the maximum number of people to be inside the store is like only twenty five
and it's black friday so
people like trying to get in so even if I tell them uh I'm sorry lah you cannot
then they just keep doing the annoyed face
but the I'm just saying ah not not not really good not a good day how about you
like I see everybody is like shopping black friday's sale so good
hmm good question
then you where where was where was your intern again
oh that's your interview I mean like when your intern start
oh cause I got part time school and
holidays is not holidays already
revise and get all the projects done
but this time is infographic but
it's better it's a group project so at least
me

then but for you you I thought you studied like
mm cause right now it's not
easy to get accounting job with uh like
maybe I try to apply if I get if not what I'm just going to go maybe just administrative work
but
overseas
oh my god if COVID is over
just like
of course like I miss most is like the different
like currency you know like anything it's just anything and everything is cheaper there
like it's in singapore you know the everything is much more expensive so you can't spent that much
you have to be like save save a bit
um I don't really
have a favourite like
but I know you're more into fashion kan
so actually how about you just tell me like actually what kind of like
fashion you're into right now
like koreans are known for their skin
you know like their clear skin
and it's like actually cheaper to buy there is cause they they sell it like in bundles and like there's always promotion on their items
but I but like they are also known for their fashion but I didn't like I'm not into it so I didn't buy a lot of like their shoes or like clothing

so now that they open it they bring back samurai I was so happy like I think I ate it twice already this week
but if like their menu
I usually go for the angus burger
it's like a upgraded version of cheeseburger like you how about you what what is your go-to menu at McDonald's
at the end of the day I'll still go for like home-cooked meals
Jollibee oh my god Jollibee is a Jollibee is a filipino
fast food right
Adam's Corner
Adam's Corner
oh you suggest me to eat at Adam's Corner there
wah
then what what do you suggest me eating there
water chestnut
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there lah cause more of nature so many insects
I um my sister she used to lah she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong lah
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
if you not a if you just like um afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school haiyo
huh
wow I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try lah try to be on time lah it's school it's important
me graduate
I started school err this year april
so it's only been how many months
uh few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
hmm looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so lah
then eh you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
oh
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
mm I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your during secondary school
wow then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
uh that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
uh no I take care of myself very well
um like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay lah since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
oh really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
oh good lah
hmm nevermind lah
like
right now oh you heard about like
uh I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
oh
it's okay lah we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
uh I really
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good lah you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
wah I really I like oh yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know uh
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
ah every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
oh wah everything you want to do with your friend ah then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
oh uh you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
uh government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure lah but like what it can be use for
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
relax what you so stress about
wah talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like uh allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
swim oh uh have you like you know uh sentosa also there's a lot of like
uh activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually
uh oh I used to work at luge actually I've I find luge
it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
uh trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because uh apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same lah
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
uh I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you lah
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try lah I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
wow that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands huh
wah then what's your favourite car
but I'm just not into it like you know like
like there's interest in car no I like car I mean it
I can sit down it gets me to places with shelter
oh then you watch tokyo drift ah you like japanese car
oh the fast and furious movies is it ya actually tokyo drift all uh
is it is it too fast too furious or the fast and furious one oh I think just anything before that is nice but after
I don't like not really into the show lah
way before what don't so text me just saying you watch the show when there's paul walker
so when there's no paul walker you don't watch it anymore
nissan skyline
oh I think I heard of that car before
wah but I don't know lah I I'm I look so weird by myself like I don't have like interest
but it's weird you don't know like people always have like will be interest in cars interest in bikes
or interest in like footballs and all
ya I'm amazed that like
wah so you have been supporting that club since you were three years old
wow
I feel like that's against your will
but it's okay I guess you learn
you grow to learn the eh eh you learn to grow
hais
english is hard but it's okay I think you love your club already but is your club really good actually or you just love them
but is man U still as good as they were
wah wow
but I know lah like I like I used to hear like man U is like good but now
I don't really hear much about them anymore so like
I don't know anything but it's
cool to know lah from you
true lah you also cannot expect all good players to go into man U right of course you have to give chance to other teams to bring up their name also
are you being an haters right now like maybe right now it's liverpool time to shine
hmm interesting wow
wah I feel like wah I'm not looking forward for work tomorrow like
uh ah I also just want to relax and really just watch something I like
true
hais
nevermind I think we just have to endure a bit
get through this hard time then maybe when we're
things are easier
then we can just
enjoy life already
ya I agree
is it
rain before sunshine
but just a bit more let's let this COVID pass and then we can get back our good jobs
mm mm
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
uh like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay lah let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education
then I'm sure things will be better for us
okay
it's really nice like talking to you all about this like

err my day today was okay it was quite a slow day uh
because I didn't do much uh today
um I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work lah
I haven't actually applied for anything
err I was there was this err job link that adli sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
err
err annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly lah but then there was an addendum to the title
that said uh it was uh
malay language specialist
basically just listen to
and then
transcribe them into
words ah
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
err natural language processing
feel
which is more concern with err and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually err learns language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then err
so
so ya lah the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
ah yes I will be part of that
a'ah
soon lah in a few days lah I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
so like
I got no results
the
err
so far no uh except for a few that I saw err
err wherever lah I think there's a few locations
no like err I I meet the requirements ya
mm
okay lah the exam was
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and err second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy uh
the best eh
probably second language learning
huh why
no uh because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory what so it's more difficult to screw up
ya ya I just want to pass
mm ya
your leave
mm
mmhmm
hmm
wait pause they made you take
a test
ah
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training eh
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya your boss's boss
ya
mmhmm
huh how come your computer shut down in the room
oh so the
so basically the zoom thing crash lah nothing wrong with your computer lah
okay okay good
whoa
okay uh
I sat in the chair
but it's okay lah I mean I managed to
err get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was err
that one maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want ah
I mean
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
ah
then he suddenly appears
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift eh
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
so
so basically there was no person in charge lah for the thing
wah co in charge lah
on the ups
mmhmm
mmhmm
after six
oh okay
oh
oh okay okay
ya
hmm
so he's new
ah
mm
oh
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
eh to whoever's listening
confidential okay
mmhmm
the what thing
oh okay
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
mm err on the days you're schooling
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
you
oh you cannot request for shift change eh
oh for your class eh
eh I think I destroyed your chair
oh okay
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
mm
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
mm
ya
mm
I think you felt the same way in that
take a break if that makes sense
mmhmm
oh shit serious ah
mm
ya
mmhmm
justin bieber
oh
oh they are not big fans of justin bieber
mm
have different workflows eh
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
oh ya lah
you better do it
ya
serious ah
mm
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit err
weird
like
there's no
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you uh
the previous shift
complacent ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I don't know uh I think
honestly to me
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send uh
in what sense
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya
mm
wait
okay
mm
mm
a'ah
ya like you
mm
mm
oh ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
a'ah
mmhmm
ah
ah
jaded
mm
oh okay
I was actually going to make a joke
ah okay lah
mm
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
huh
ya ya they know we we also know
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker eh
no no there's there's
ya there's
no now that one person has more uh
malay vocabulary to transcribe
ya ya
I don't know uh but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
kan it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine ah it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable lah
aiya
ah
a'ah sia
ah ya lah of course lah it's their job
just anime like
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching um
err Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
err
err there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
maybe add three or four months
ah ya
in japan
oh
but mm
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file ah
cloud
oh ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one ah
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
artefacts
but but then again
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands uh two thousand one to two thousand and four
the actual film
like
err like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
or like something someone would draw in paint
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the kan the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
err
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
huh
I mean you have an eye for the frame what
and then after that you will get like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things uh like
behind ya that kind of shot ah
mm
A U T E U R eh
a'ah
auteur
ya
but
err anything ah can also uh
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
flexible
in what sense
mm
okay ya
mm
oh to get ah ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and err location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
but with
a
psychological uh age not twist ah like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about ah
that looking into the
err
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay ah stimulating ah but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like um
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and err
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
err three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
through
err power
you know and like
a display of real fear
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
err
let's see
ah the wailing
the wailing
it's like
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
mm
ah
ah
ah
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
mm
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
mm
oh ya ya a'ah
mm
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail ah
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
oh ya that's okay okay we watched that one
we watched that one in the cinema uh
nevermind ah
I think that one will I probably will have to watch with rehan lights off speakers on
oh
mm
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it ah
eh I got A you know don't play play you know
director of photography ah
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
ah
no you know no
no lah we do it we do it properly lah but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from err getting
uh machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
oh ya
no need ah low budget ah indie
live what
no lah it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no lah
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free lah
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
oh ya correct correct
okay lah then when we on our off day then we do ah
I think can can no worry can be done
oh ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon lah
like next year
uh my hot ah
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or what
ah whatever game you can try you try ah
mm you never try Borderland three
buy ah
for the for the release price lah the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday eh
what you buy
oh ya
oh ya later ah later
masks
yes
compress
okay lah
oh okay
huh
I want to I want to take one
nezuko
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation ah
ya lah so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the weeaboos it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
then I'm like bro you don't know what the weeaboos go through
I think
mm
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic ah in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
oh no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
mm
uh haikyu is not that
mm
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
oregairu
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
grounded in realism
ya like it was well thought out and well written ah
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season ah
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
mm
how it works is usually
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
ya
so that's basically how it works uh
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm
oh
mm
hmm
mm
J drama
mm
ah I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas eh
mmhmm
makeup
okay lah
decently young lah
oh
mm
mm
oh bullying eh
mm
ya
uh huh
uh huh
okay
mm
international
because there's a connection
mm
mm
mm ya
oh I mean jakarta is the city pe
oh okay
I think maybe most people who want to take korean are nice people
the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
ah then after that I I I off I off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me
oh okay
mm
oh okay
a'ah
ah
ah
ah
oh yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
mm
oh yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
mm
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of err child language development
ya I learnt that
ah
koreaboo
but oh ya the key caps
wah
ya then it was like seventeen like that
oh okay
it dropped down some more
ya one O four key
huh
uh most of them use the same stems anyway lah

hi I'm okay
mmhmm
orh
all the way
oh wow
mm mm
mmhmm ya
oh wow
mm
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
hmm
err
and then they they said err depends ah ma'am depends I said huh
circuit breaker ya orh
mm mm
mm on that day itself ah orh okay okay
mm mm
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing seh it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job lah basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like uh mcdonald's then okay ya err like customer number one two three four and then they just say ah ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
mm
mm mm
mm
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business huh
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like huh
mm mm
oh my god really
is it because of circuit breaker
mm mm true lah
uh uh
mm mm
mm mm
huh
mm mm
thanks eh
ah maybe lah mm mm mm mm
so ang moh lah you know and then
ya but it's quite serious lah because I don't know
ah
mm eh
mm mm mm
orh
oh
mm mm okay okay
mm orh
mm mm
oh
oh my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
mm aedes correct ya
mm
most likely it is lah
mm mm mm mm
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat lah once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
mm correct correct
every other day sure got some story one
in the news both mm mm local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting sia I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like oh my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
crazy mm mm mm mm mm
huh oh my god
so scary
oh my god
mm mm fifty five
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya lah that's true lah mm mm it's a bit more controlled lah ah
mm mm true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know mm mm
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
natural garden ah
ya definitely definitely
mm mm
ya that's true
mm mm
ya lah I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like err quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that oh my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know lah I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important seh
mm mm
I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like walao like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about um you know using this reserves for
for all the I mean all these schemes lah like you said so
mm mm ya lor that's why funny ah
mm mm almost half a year lah
mm mm
ya that's on transport food ya
mm mm ya lah ya lah correct
mm mm mm mm
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
mm mm
something that I don't know like
ya lah
correct correct correct or just do virtual lor everything nowadays virtual virtual event
but everything lah everything is now virtual lah like but it's quite actually interesting lah like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
ya that's true mm mm
endless seh like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
like you say lah they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
mm mm
mm mm
wah
funny ya
ya lah sometimes no choice is the best choice lah ha
mm mm
mm mm physical is no longer really needed lah ha
mm mm mm mm
ya lah but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
normal I guess you know
mm mm ya
ah wow amazing mm mm
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya lah mm mm
mm mm ya lah ya lah
mm mm cancelled kan oh postpone ah okay okay
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know lah I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
oh ya I think I saw that
mm mm
nature is healing ah mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
mm mm mm mm
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
mm mm mm
mm mm less is more
mm mm
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving what you know
mm mm
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it lah you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell lah oh okay mm mm hobby eh
mm mm ya that's true
ya lah must be positive lah because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done lah of course but can be done it can be done ya
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
true
standard ah
mm mm
I mean it's complaining is part of life lah you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
mm mm true very true
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely kan uh uh
ya
mm mm
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see eh
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like mm
mm mm

it was okay lah um they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that err they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there jer siala what is my five year plan
err there's a position that opens up in a different department and um my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to ah
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay mm answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees ah sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like oh
but it gives me a very nice err
oh long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long oh they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can err I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like oh I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like eh so what you want do you for five years ah ah you know like you like you could say like huh five years ah wah I never really think about it eh and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also err
you also answer like oh never really think about it eh but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long lah but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer lah so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say ah oh ah I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee um so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve um more things
which is true I I think it's also like um I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that oh err in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K oh you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you eh I give you three point five lah you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic what so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different um setting it's all about how you make it um you make it work in the in in this stuff kan lah fourteen december
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that um
I don't want to be too greedy lah like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale wah that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack ah but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
yes I know your work right um about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
err
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say lah hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like wah you say this kind of things ah
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and err we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household lah but you know on an average
mm
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand wow
wow
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up lah I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel lah but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account eh there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically um
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't err I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say oh it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website err can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account eh you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting um this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
err it's the security

the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks

and then um
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes

so that's why you have to wear safety shoes for safety reasons
monday to friday yes

and then after that they say okay within two weeks ah give you we will email you your training dates

I was at home
start already technically start already I'm being paid ya
ah okay babe
prorated lah so now until thirtieth
but the the pay is like mid base month
ya I don't like that kind
ya one month lah
ya
so meaning next month I work that whole month right and then after that
the in january then I get the pay the mid jan
ya I don't like that kind because is
my sister said is because of the government sector
ya
that's weird
I mean your
earlier hmm
my barber shop
also the pay is

what pay is this
like how did you even
no lah the cut off date is one month
debit ya
then the in between the one to fifteen is all next month pay
like that ya so need to reshuffle your
spending and everything ah
ya that's why my my
my phone bill is end of the month gym is early month
hello is Fitness First
Fitness First

the the
deserted
and then after that the second one the third one is buona vista because currently buona vista has three
around there
there's metropolis there's fusionopolis there's another polis

when is the time
ya

nowadays ah is one eight zero eh
the monthly
their monthly membership

no then mine is one three six then my cousin one is one five something
I think but my one was
mine is
got promo
ah
the promo ended already because ah you sign up with a insurance then you paid a little bit then you get this price
but it doesn't add up one eight zero
ya
ya then is then because my friend say like join GYMMBOXX or anytime fitness then I was like huh anytime fitness is like what eighty eight
mm
not that I
I been there once and then but I just don't like
like very
the weight is not is not the same
uh huh
because I started with my friend what and then after that he trained me and then stuff like that then after a while then I get the hang of it I guess
then I also watch video
like instagram

I did a trial two week two week two year
no
F forty five
I
really
oh ya
oh ya you join already

I did the trial way before you join
no because is expensive I have to paid member I mean I have to pay lesson and this one
it was either all so I just take the gym but
F forty five is a shit
oh ya because
like because everybody is like
you are new
then everybody know each other and then ya and then like but it depends on the centre itself like my centre is jurong one right and then is family oriented-ish
no no as in how they mix around is very family-ish
and then after that they will go round
then like okay let's go let's go let's go ah
huh
oh is it
F forty five
is she fit
maybe she got background
which outlet is this
interesting

ya that's why I like like
or how about you apply ah gym receptionist

ya that what I
is working there as a receptionist I guess

then the funny story is he got a job
ah
that day I I accompany him at holland eh not holland V err
where ah tiong bahru
for interview but he don't want ah
via zoom lah
then no because actually he cannot do the interview at home because the house is very noisy so he ask me out

interviewee something ya
that he doesn't have background and everything then he say never mind we can help you err we can guide you and everything there but when when he went there nobody guide him
so everything like basically he sat there
ya
then
ya

of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
so uh of course I was even more happy lah that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that
ya no okay ya I was very happy when I got the present
anything
but I know one thing at least ah my friends my kawan kaki bola yang celebrated my birthday with me ah they actually
I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
that's why that's the thing
think about anything but then again
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any
to find your places that you want to go lah
a lot of steam food a lot of soup a lot of herbs
so of course I wish I had that kind of a complexion but it's okay no problem
that feeling of like you are sitting
staycation at resorts world sentosa
do the spending and we are the ones who will have to
err help to revive our very own
economy so I hope that so I hope that I hope that uh we will we will be able to come out of this uh COVID nineteen strong and hopefully we will
go back to being normal arab we will all still stay happy and positive
okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye

I guess that's a need lah not a wish
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded kan it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do kan
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and err where you watch people eat
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited one
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now err
for your suit jer
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy one ah
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K lah faster lah you order for me and then you order for safi also lah
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series lah kan
then I just pass it off as spider cat ah
the one that you say oh black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday oh ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch lah
the thing is I don't know whether I ah actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
ah I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
oh gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave kan maybe I just take this friday lor next tuesday is for its for appointment what
wah I don't get it seh how did you even accumulate fourteen days eh oh ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
wow what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
oh
during his first year birthday eh wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the EX1>bangla< paid
aiyo I'm just thinking
okay lah no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
then the is the end product nice
no I mean like dan house
you can just ask what
like that
huh
no I mean especially if it's if no surprise to see talking about surprise that's the thing sometimes right it works err in your favour sometimes
not hot pink lah like the like the lighter one like a bit more pale
the app no lah that one champagne gold lah ya ya ya correct correct correct ah like that
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part ah change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that one no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book eh
gosh
h
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need kan
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop kan is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
camera our phone cannot set raw kan raw image file
what iphone can ah
four A is small kan
aiyo
I'm just thinking what should we have what shall we eat for dinner already cause I know but that's for the kids
oh
so in the end you pick up what time
oh
sensitive eh
it's okay ah
that's very good that's a five star rating for the delivery man
eh sia lah
why ah
oh right right right um I remember um they asked me to rate that time ya rate your delivery person
oh right right right ah I remember err they ask me to rate that time your rate your delivery person
oh
I don't know some people they they always say err you always have room for improvement so they always give four point five I'm like what the heck tell me ah where is the room then they always like oh you know we cannot give perfect score because you know we must leave some room for us maybe that's why I know I know
huh
beat it ah
beat it ah
I can't remember maybe maybe I think my reaction was the same as last time ah
it's harder to
is because of the figure of eight
crank course not crank course lah plank
the crank course is ninety degrees kan its like U-turn lah
no I thought that one only for the first lesson only
only the first lesson kan I don't know lah I'm just thinking whether I should take class two a
drink this water or not
from last week lah that I am that's okay what it's just water
huh what do you mean
doesn't correspond with the job ah
huh
ya how much how much did he did he quote
um
right
ya lah
okay but that that is not her problem what is the deal ya is the deal between the father and ya you guys what like he has no right to intercept what who told him
there is another company if you all want to consider ah it's quite easy video ya work not bad lah but maybe the okay but you also not going to stay there but if you want to do them a favour you can check it no but will will will you will you even like speak to them about the like if they need any video
eh is it because of the the payment the changes oh that sucks
serious compensation as in like discounted lah oh my god and is already like at the low you all only you all choose the lowest lowest vendor get the most out of the smallest budget
I see that lady that is going away she is stepping down again
wow so this event is to commemorate her stepping down lah what oh the the election
moment ah
right
fourteen upcoming members as in new members
new and existing I don't understand what do you mean total is fourteen so now you have how many oh
wah so actually I want to know what's the criteria for you to become a board member
I mean you must have you must be earning some form of money because she is a board member right
see that's why I want to know because if you are a working staff you don't qualify to be a board member already what
right
the broth
tayoh
it's very everything is important you know when they say like oh everything is urgent
maximum I can bring you is to the door but to open the door right you need this key and this key is a degree
then they will be like oh can lah shah you know I would right but I could could not I cannot ya sia really I always give this kind of then they will say shan stop trying to be clever I'm not trying to be clever if I'm clever I'm already your boss
then they just laugh
because if I start on it I cannot do anything else and everything else is urgent so by the time I get this for this scheduling I cannot finish it ya and the deadline is tomorrow wait is today the deadline today is thursday right today is the deadline
for now time is ticking and I'm thinking what to eat later so I don't know so that's that's one of the stress that I I don't know how to work around this picture the other thing is
I should lah actually
exactly and people are going to brunei you wah
crawl
really
why don't we try that because the baygon the pesticide is really very

err

then after that err
if she's with her boyfriend ah you are fighting ah
you are fighting against ah you're fighting for her with the boyfriend
stephen stephen chow
ah
a'ah
ya
it's true ah
it makes sense ah cause like I mean like
it's not written anywhere tau
but that's the funny thing like a lot of people say french people are more romantic kan but at the same time french people are much more open
uh huh
ya
and how we are actually romanticised by all these things that humans
we believe it's such negative which actually weakens us tau
okay lah
a'ah
but for us we assume he know and second thing we assume that he will get offended
we expect that from an adult but when it comes to baby kan
one week of work

like
kids kan okay if you are rich

the belief is the hell note is to bribe the guardians of the hell gates then ya that's what I heard lah
ya but you steal is
you steal is because you need to survive kind tau
but if you rich then you got a lot of sin you need to bribe a lot that's right
but islam is very fair
ya let that's why you have to prepare yourself that's like another question
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya lah
ya
ya but they always say that the paradise is not for the good people it's for the sinners
who repent ya
kan but I think all these all these people all these typical
people in our community makes it
you guys are judgy bunch
mmhmm
ya
kan
ya lah
that was the thing that was flying
I don't know maybe
okay
okay I will see you in twenty twenty two
ya man
okay
mmhmm
mm
but it's a it's typical what to do that
mmhmm
mm
ah
kan then ah it's like you cover your head but you never cover your bottom
then I was like okay but not all of them are like that what like how right now I have the stigma of a single mother
kan
but
how we react to that it shows
shows ah shows how we are as a person ah so I don't care lah
kan
hmm
be more proper
kan
ya
mmhmm
kan
to certain people it will be like
men are known to have like mental images and they keep
ha
mm
mm
mm
seriously
oh damn you weird
weirdo
I don't know lah whatever lah then
wow
hmm
wow
should we do that like for our
like
gain popularity
for goodness
mmhmm
oh man I can't do that
ya but that's another way for you to tone down your voice what
it's like a beat man
what sia
a'ah
what to expect how to bring yourself
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
kan
kan
is it the time for me to wear
kan
okay lah not really lah
kan
mmhmm
sis is already is big it's not like I am
exactly that's why like you know sometimes and I'm I'm thinking like you know moving forward like what kind of clothes I would want to wear as a hijabi that
with big build or who is plus size or you know like for people who are bigger lah
ya that's why
mm
it's like looking
I don't want to say that word
ringarde
ya
because you are not supposed to stand out you are supposed to
be modest for yourself and for your creator

if that day right I already start uh applying for jobs on this uh
fast job app online then a few of the jobs ah like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but uh because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will uh record and then they will see then they will pay
mm
mm but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
mm
ah
so basically you just have to rate the uh display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
oh my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy paiseh right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come lah it's just that they don't know who only right
oh my god
but imagine ah if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then ah another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the um it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that uh she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company lah but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya lah anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good lah it's three times a week only
mm permanent part time but they need it uh long term
uh shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so it's quite convenient what it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
mm
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already mah
uh the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff lah
mm mm
so just anyway just send lah just see how
but some of them ah don't even bother to reply
one six months ah six months to one year you know
and then uh they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose uh the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar eh
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that err also I think it's mondays to
eh it's alternate days eh
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week ah
actually they will give us uh every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
ah rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit lah and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification lah I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because uh according to the rule you cannot do that lah if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically ah you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard uh my ex company
some of the pinoys ah they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these uh factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra uh I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms eh and then I think there's uh three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people lah
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely lah
and
so he said uh sometimes they dabao then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part lah
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean lah then I'm like eh but you are using the toilet also eh
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent eh
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also lah
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit ah that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent lah you cannot um anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have lah because um they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and um I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go lah I guess but then
ya lah like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the uh advertisement right or the job uh post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency lah
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best lor
but then six thousand eh
I didn't know that uh all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K ah I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks ah sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure ah when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo ah is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental ah can
give her like four five K per month eh
because I have friends who married ang moh right so expat ah
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month ah you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already ah
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses lah I mean like um
as male bosses are okay
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
err the husband is paying what why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always ah book first book a travel first
then got one time ah suddenly the the secretary call me and say eh how come my boss ah the krisflyer point is um
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this uh relocation company
the wife redeem uh free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part ah they didn't even uh say anything to me you know
then after that uh until I ask again ah
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also paiseh ah I said oh ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the uh points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim lor
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only uh get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible one ah that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see lah you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket ah you must tell them this one ah if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay lah not that much ah
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot lah because this is obviously your mistake
for us ah the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault lah because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright what how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary ah especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either ho chin minh or hanoi
so in the end I think you must have booked him on lah because only these two fly direct what
ya
ya lah very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch ah it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date lah so at least eh
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means ah the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel lah
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate ah
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already what
you can always book um through
all these third party from the website lah no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes ah hotel themselves even though they give uh they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in what
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course lah right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people ah
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least ah you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one ah family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because uh booking from third party ah I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday uh sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but hong kong passport don't need visa what
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival lah always uh tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
mm
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes ah you just
can you imagine ah if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then ah I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company uh based right
oh
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity ah anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it duh
ya just put out your resume first ah
mm

okay I started recording
okay ya can
so later on today you are going to go for the other um what do you call that focus group
uh huh
amirah amirah from ah oh oh
how do you know I mean how do you know she's going
ah
ah oh
mm
what mmhmm
wah
ah
ah
a'ah
oh
ya
ah
I see
wow then that what then ya I mean if you didn't enjoy the show then you have to give them the feedback lah like oh I couldn't sit through
ah
a'ah
lah
ya
oh my god
syarif syarif malaque eh oh okay
I see
ya correct ya I mean nobody really turns on the
no
ya so it's like err I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
ya that one was quite interesting
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to oh okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says ah which is very true everything is on demand
ah
oh my goodness
I mean ya it's true I mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to right
or something like that
I'll try to put my phone
K K I put my phone here okay ya
oh ya what finance
oh yes yes yes cool
oh a partner
oh err wait
oh true true true
ya then I will find a partner
let me try my husband
oh
ah ah ah
ya
haiya if like that then
like that jannah and I meet up lah to do it
then like that there's no issue about it right
ya can also then it'll be like a meetup hangout
ya
sounds good
ah
okay
ya
pessimistic as in about your relationship
uh huh uh huh
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
oh okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house what
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
ya
mmhmm
ah
ah
I don't know but ros also
oh like you yourself okay
mm mm
mm
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole lah also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
huh
a'ah
ya
what oh no but eh five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya lah there's your savings
dope okay lah hundred plus
okay eh then okay eh not so bad eh hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan ah is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
mm
mm mm
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus lah
mm
ah ah
ah
ah
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from kan
ah okay okay can lah
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
oh no

I'm very lucky already still want to complain about my son I think about sending him all the time
crazy ah
he is I don't know I think he is
ya he he has his moments lah but he's becoming so naughty ya ya he like just the other day he falls off the bed tau
ya did he he he rolled off the bed
ya
so now we are trying to put him on the mattress
then you know I started baby proofing my house
ya so got the baby lock lah you know by the drawers you have to ah pull out and things like that ya but hanan figured it out like he plays with the hook
then he he he saw me doing it and then he copied

I didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct

she should go cause her sisters also going
oh my gosh
but her sister got degree
oh oh oh
okay
mmhmm
mm ya
mm mm
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
eh actually you don't need lah you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya lah
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that lah but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya lah a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the
I think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at then I feel it's really worth it
that to me ah
and then they teach you
ya lah around there lor
that is what for one year only right twenty three twenty three K
eighteen months
actually okay what right
eh but come
ah ya true ya true true
ya that's true plus you are also getting married
ya ya ya ya
but don't do anything you don't want to do
you know
but now you realised that hey actually my life is pretty good right unmarried not not married
and then you are not sure by getting married it will make your life better or worse like would you even feel empty if you're not married
you know what I mean
ya
mm mm
there is there is
no of course there's going to be a very good reason to get married
you
ya
ya ya ya it's a perfect size and width
mm mm
okay okay
ya mmhmm
ya
like I would go and save and look for couple massage and then buy right
but he splurged like five hundred plus okay then
ah
okay
wah
okay okay
a'ah
a'ah ya like the what the wave okay
ah
ah ah ah ah
ah nice and where did you guys go for dinner
nice
as in ros booked the restaurant okay
mm okay okay
mm
so he cancelled the other one
nice pretty nice
aww so nice then what what you packed
like you packed like the clothes for the day
huh
cute seh
you know I trust him now
that's good that's good
ya
which is I mean to be fair also it's hard for him lah how is he going to talk somebody like robert right who's been in your life for so long
ya slowly in future to your family
ya lah I know
what what what about him does she wish would be better
that's good lah
there's a I do there isn't but ya she just decided that okay lah just let them live their life
you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interfere
then after that he's like why you so rude ah I don't want to go lah then he called his sister and said oh I'm I'm not going already then I have to go lah I went out with his family
and my sister-in-law and hanan
ya I was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited seh they want to go out with hanan
hais
I want I'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see lah inshaallah lah and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee lah like um you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me lah they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
ya
ah
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
his family I mean his sister asked me lah I told his sister lah the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
ya
like he got his temper
ah ya I told I told his sister ya
ya
hais
ya lah this is
eh you know that used to be me but now I'm like haiya I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
he's okay if cause for hanan right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually hanan is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work what
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also lah but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like hidayat will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
ya lah but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
but like plain
no salt no what
now um next week ah
ya
ya hopefully
maybe
huh I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
hais
ya
the only one for a long time
oh my gosh
ya so he
he's going to do it at furama err this girl is from she's doing ah I think it's his schoolmate or something
ex schoolmate so she studies biomedical sciences
ah
cause of the cause of the way he responds
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
I don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research
nazreen is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister lah they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya I saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause nazreen works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely
ya but then the girl works at so you imagine
huh serious
serious
mm mm
plus the set up all that which which is okay I I don't know I thought ya but then I think my degree was cheaper so but they got they got back quite a bit lah so in the end
ah
as in like okay lah
eh but still
you don't have to worry so much about the guests you can just
slowly take your time
mm
ya fifty is too little already
you cannot that means it's really just family lor
right if it's fifty your aunties and uncles already dah fifty people plus your cousins
ya
oh my god then you have to do another wedding for the other side

ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with aisyah his girlfriend aisyah aziz
it was okay lah but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like oh you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows what his girlfriend is aisyah aziz
like hello

ya correct correct
and the chemistry is just not there right
like
mm ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is dzar who carries the conversation right with the
people like razz will
a'ah
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually dzar can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no lah
din doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that oh okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least dzar has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting

so there's like
what is it is it water and
no no don't touch me there don't this is my no no square square
no no don't touch me there this is my no no square
a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world ah these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
reaching yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
ya that what I was thinking
eh
just over there
mm
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also lah
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
ah how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
ah about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time oh wow yet
amazing ah
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
want to stab yes
oh please ah
ya
I can be anything I want
I want to break free
wah what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing
I don't know meh
but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
mm
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be
what do you mean
like a super super power like a superhero
um I don't even have to have a superpower taffy mention
like you don't grow old
oo and just excel in it
that would be cool then like my laptop wouldn't be smelling like matcha now
mm
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers um
mmhmm
transportation eh
sure
it's at the back of my head
teleportation
ya I think I'd rather be I'd rather have teleportation because flying need still need to use energy
but literally we can just teleport anywhere you want
wendy
wizard of oz
might be wanda wanda fairy fairly oddparents
ya
and then she had to tap her legs like
what is one skill that you wanted to learn though
that you always want to learn but you haven't learnt yet
E two
investment
stock
stock trading
why would you want to learn that
but it's so like hectic though
I thought I will get migraine
but you
mind opening
ya
actually I don't know how it works also
but you have to call it and then like someone just get high ya I don't know
that is very fascinating
oo
nobody thinks about
what do I think about your
I think it's a cool skill to learn I'm not sure whether it will be useful
but
it's cool
ya
ya ya ya
that I want to learn
hmm
I feel like I'm quite talented
but I mean
of course there's a lot of things that I don't know also
I want to learn how to
do investments
no really really that's what I really want like I'm I'm very like because I feel like at this age
a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it lah basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
I want to grow I want to grow grow grow
a'ah
Enfagrow
combine combine combine combine combine
oo
is it a bear
oo
oo it's a giraffe
oo
confuse eh
but actually when I was a young child not baby I couldn't drink normal milk
apparently my mum said like I will reject
then I was like mm how then ya lah I just picked you lah then you become smelly baby
then I was like oo okay
ah
fun
oh oh it's at the top of my mind
of course
I thought miss suriati told us
yes
ah suck
one last night
ah
whoa
actually britney spears
ya but like before her meltdown lah because I think right now she's a bit awkward
she's like
sometimes I feel
before the meltdown
princess
ya I feel like she's a good entertainer err
I think she was like like
ee ee
ya like especially when they started young
ya ya like if you started very young then you grow up
feeling very
like empty because you got
everything that you need
ya
ya
now what ya
I mean if I think about it lah it's a good life to live but
ya it's just managing your mental health
true
mental health advocate
but I feel like
the only way you can train yourself to have a healthy mind is to always be open about your emotions and your thoughts
you cannot like keep it inside you once you keep it inside you
a'ah
eww
oh my god
air
it's seriously the worst you already charge me like
what
seventy cents for air you know I mean it's like no
no no no no no
mine is like potato through and through
through and through
mmhmm
yes I love it
thick
I think they're trying to save money or something lah
cut on the spices
eh
all the way
what
I've never had it where do you had have this
ya
so strange but okay
s'mores
it's too much
it's true it's true maybe you guys should
take it take a look into this I think one conversation is a bit too long
good ya
of course of course
ya ya ya
like people expect people to actually talk a lot
aww
hey
oh wow
oh like lime lime
zesty zesty
not carbonated
oo
if you could be a drink what drink would you be
your tea leaves
martini
it it doesn't have to be alcoholic
it could be a non-alcoholic drink
mm
oh my god ya mokhtar
I wonder how he is
I hope so
oh my god did you see nisa
she give birth already ya
rainbow baby you know I remember something apparently like I'm a rainbow baby
a rainbow baby is like a when that baby came after a
another baby died before him hor her ya
so I'm supposed
to have an another older siblings before me after my older brother ya
so does that make me a rainbow baby I guess so
ya
oh rainbow
oh wow
it's true it's true
if I could be a drink I would like to be a teh cino
but I am a teh cino
because it's like sweet I mean it can be sweet if you want to it depends on how you stir the tea so if you stir it well I can be really sweet to you but if you don't stir it well might be sweet at
first but then once nope I could be bitter at first but then once you reach the bottom I could be really sweet
but then if you mix it also the colour the colour of the teh cino is also my colour of the skin
oh my god it could be something that I say like in every date
okay you want to do that I get

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
meal
meal
oh
meal
mm my memorable meal
well
actually I cannot recall there were many
I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this um same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
mmhmm
smoked duck
uh
was it good
mm but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
err
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before

err travel you know you can start travelling
yes this one is my this one I'm not it's just now the bear talk it's I mean I mean what I say
yes
mm
um
for me
drama or film
is
is purely an entertainment
I don't mind it's fiction or non fiction
kind of story because
these things are purely for entertainment so you just got entertained that's the purpose of
the visual
right
so I'm okay with any
ya anything I'm I'm okay
ya so I like like
err
short film ah short film
even movie also
okay lah

really
mm
then I also like twilight
ya
yes
ya
but I like the
actually ah more than I don't know I don't remember exactly the story but more than that I like where it was shot like this was like inside a forest right
ya so I like the background
uh the songs
uh
storyline also
okay lah
ya
ya
huh
prepared to sit and watch but I I it's a a but I like to watch them
uh
I think the most um movie
ya
huh
tobey
ya
err the maybe it's because the first one I watched
mm
mm
ah
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
you mean err
professors doing part time
they have other jobs right
mm
mm
to meet your mentor
who who is your mentor is it a professor
okay
mm
mm
uh
so how do you find your course uh is it you liking it
you mean your your A level friends
mm
your your friends friends who are doing the same course you mean
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
oh they have and all masters and all ah
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
mm
mm
mm
teaching
then
um but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
eh
mm
mm
mm
me
ya
ya so
uh we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know err take our time then
because now err when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
uh and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing eh
have
has my tedious life
mm
ya
so
what lah
mm
ya
free
oh there was err it's err healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill uh and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very uh
you know um
so let's
so that's going to
um make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
um
ah
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
eh common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
mm
mm
I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
mm
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
mmhmm
ya
one dish
mm
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast lah
I don't mind
but err only the downside is that
err because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
um
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
uh
ya
fried rice
oh mee hoon tom yum
okay
ah
okay
so how was the rice today uh the mandi rice
the smoke is just like only on the surface
ya
curry
hmm
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best um mandi rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
mm
okay
mm
pizza hut
hey which pizza you ate ah
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
err tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and ghee rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy lah
let's say you take err one cup of rice
any cups lah
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
err according to your taste lah
then you cook lah rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version lah there's many kind of
instead of uh instead of
so what's that one and a half cup right
uh
then you put the rice
ah
ya
ya curry chicken lah the best with potatoes
mm
can
no oh it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
I already to
it's not that difficult you just need one
ah onion that's all then the rest
ya you can use the rice cooker
the
pot lah the there is a pot call multi
err what is the name of the pot uh you can cook everything in that pot
err
yes

but to me like what's done is done that was like a last month thing right
like the whole
ah but
he should have
you know
be upfront with everybody you about it right
wow
I mean of course
had anyone would would be pissed about that
so where's the guy now
ya ya
then his
then his things
right
but where that where can he go
I thought when he'll he'll stay with you cause he doesn't have he doesn't have a place
no but I don't
no but I don't have a place to go I I don't want to live in my mum's living room
alright I mean okay fair enough
but I thought he was
okay money
from his the other his
but
true
so what did he do with the money then
right
ha ha ha
no but that kind of behaviour right okay to be fair
he was my friend
a strangle
then you know you kind of knuckle jack hits a bit
wah man I cannot ah
but that's terrible ah
like
we are talking about like thousand two right or something
to be honest your rental rates is nonsense ah
you know
I would pay you five like like five six hundred for like
rental
ha ha
or there's
or there's an actual plague going on ha ha
okay so um about fahim thing
err
the other day
okay err
I'm going to say something about
brother herme
kan
right
ayip
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
and all that
then on the way back err I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
oh down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things ah
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
ah then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired ah
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
ah us ya
so um then he was saying how um
how did they go into it I
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
err
kan
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think hilmi actually supports ah no of course not
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do lah
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up ah
then he was saying how um
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that ah
so now what now is just
huh huh
it's
it doesn't feel
great ah
I was telling him ah like they are gonna
ah when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him eh I but mine wasn't cause of cheating ah of course
so
like if I was the cheater
in that sense
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit tau
ya
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
eh
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
hey brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
it it
singapore is very small
oh wow
wow that's that's going into the wrong direction ah
so anyways right
ya so um about that I think then he was
telling me that
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
fair enough ah
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch ah
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
like how do you defend
ah his his actions from a moral standpoint ah
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am lah kan
uh being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given ah
mm
I don't know that's a very controversial statement ah
so by those dates
you you describe it as um
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
to me that one it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender lah like that's true
right
okay
fahim isn't exactly mister olympia material himself pe
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the err
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life ah
at wah that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
wah I cannot
sial ah
brunei
eh no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
ah people in brunei
no I'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
ya
so like uh I was asking bell lah that time it's like why ah
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
ha ha
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying oh then she was expecting okay um one thing is
ah it's
that's A
B
err a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
but there's no tourism to speak of
free education free healthcare
right
I mean
but healthcare is not free what
ya
oh ya
so basically I was
I was talking about ah about ruqayyah and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
I think what you're trying to say in summary is that
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
uh huh
wait so there are
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
no no no no no
ah
you know
eh
wow
why does it sound mm
mmhmm
like it just physical
oh man
wow
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
how else you gonna get and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a revenge thing ah
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like I know we've known the guy for like forever
I never thought
mmhmm
now is what
fourteen years
no I never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya I never thought you with tino until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay uh marriage is like the big leveller ah
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
oh I haven't seen an iron board in years ah dude
what for
ya
mm
so anyways
I don't remember that
ha ha
wow
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier pe
don't care what you eat but the oh how many times you eat lah in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now ah
wow
eh is it
I I don't
is it
is it normal for your height I I don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing ah is it
oh no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the ah ang moh ones
ya ya ya result
white guys different ah
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
I mean we just evolved from different monkeys lah I guess
ah I don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
ah wait wait wait wait
eh wait wait
what were they talking about ah
that one
okay okay
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me
eh brother you are at low risk good job
ah ya your is twenty one point nine
orh without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the one doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference ah
according to this my is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think um I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
I think my my highest
my my my my peak ah
peak
no
my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos jer
right
I
I think I know which one you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
huh huh huh
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
mm
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it ah
ya
alright
in law no not yet so ah cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
ah german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course ah and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so um it's like things to do if the if uh for you know respiratory things ah
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing uh this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time ah he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit siao also
ah quarterly report or something lah
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message ah
saying that you know
um good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email ah
then then at then a while ago were like complaining ah how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
ah then
he will he told me he told me that first ah that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay ah this old man might might have been repeating his story again
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two ah
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like oh why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else lah right
then said no
he got COVID
what the fuck
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
um the initial thing was
they wanted to get married ah this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents lah of course
it's usually like a like a mother thing lah like
ya this kind of
ya so um and then what you call it ah then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that uh he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
islam ah
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it woo you can go on for like this ah but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it lah then I'm like
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also lah I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
eh you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy what
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
so
ya so anyway then um
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
wuhan flu and all that
ah chinese cough as they say
and then err
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and um
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow ah from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved ah which is fair
ya lah of course lah you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay ah mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up ah
then uh
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
ah and they were kind of
having some progress ah but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause uh kan they both work from home
like
uh my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
um
ya then ah he goes over to his place a lot cause uh K so my my parents live in bedok south right which is
basically near tanah merah right
then he lives at the condo at tanah merah
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once pe
ya
so she goes over there like every other day ah to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
ah okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya sia ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it lah
one of those guys
ya
and then ah she's there like every other day then um that day I kind of went to meet my mum
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of eh why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about uh that issue like my sister
um being over there lah what
and saying how oh
my mum
then
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do ah
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
so the best thing to do
ya lah exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time ah he talked to me and uh he brought me out for beers
ah I've got things to do ah
ya so I didn't
what
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course lah so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones lah it's just to like you know
ah ya
so anyway um what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
ah at first if his parents have some reservations ah about him
going out with a malay asian girl ah
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no ah ah whoa this just whoa whoa that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like ah muslim countries lah right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way tau
was it mm
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first lah

ya of course I need to make sure that it's all covered
I very self-conscious about my body
ya so the thing is now you have wearing masks right he can't really see how our faces look like all or our facial expression so I think it's fine
no no but err okay lah that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay lah
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like jer take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour
okay either way is before or after lunch hour it's not during lunch hour so you can still eat and talk ya
I think we we bought from there before
mm mm mm mm mm
why
it's okay with fish mah
mm
mm mm mm mm
ah yes lah
no you that's the thing you know when it comes to this kind of health issue kan sometimes you can be really healthy and all that but it will still happen to you
all this while
so that's the thing ah like he's always been like exercising if he's not running he'll be cycling you know that kind of thing
first thirty years of his life
oh ya ya forgot
actually I don't know because I only know them I only know him from twenty six years and above
but you never know I very I very scared like I'm always get go home girl checks is like
no lah you just tell it for yourself or for your family lah the I think that's about it
mm
mm mm
ya
mm
mm
it was really tricky ah ya I would suggest him like go go and meet a dietitian or something so that they can look at meal plans
mm mm mm mm
damn
mm gym-ing I don't know
maybe that's how they see it as a form of motivation ah
mm
mm mm mm
mm
is it
I don't reply
oh
okay okay got it
ya I got it I got it
I mean I don't know whether it's just downright creepy or is it just like very sweet like aww you keep track of my life thanks
that's true lah that's true lah
you can go shop and see what's there for cyber monday
no lah as in like just see lah like oh you guys have any like special promotion for cyber monday
ya I know cyber money means like online lah but you know you never know you can just walk around and like eh terbump into a shop eh got promo ah
I you need to refresh my memory
how much is it
no you want to buy three
but okay lah I mean have you been buying clothes recently
oh okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious
ya I know but it's like okay for me is when I buy I will buy like
ya lah I think design sizes it's it's all together mah like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd mm just see which one is um
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon
no lah as in you'll still buy but not as often as before
exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles lah
mm mm
mm mm mm of course ya ya ya
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya so nobody knows like if you wear this top I don't even know I didn't even remember that you bought it at H&M at melaka oh it's a very comfortable sweater
ya ya I mean if you want I mean I mean it'll be better if we actually left earlier just now lah so you get you get what you are looking for
ya so basically ya if it didn't work if it doesn't work out today you can always bring him tomorrow lah
I don't know because if it's been there and no one claimed it they will also want to remove it in case orh other people want to use the slot and all that
mm ya
very smart boy
mm I mean you can always check back with the doctor lah like is it normal to feel this way
mm mm mm
ah okay okay
oh okay
mm mm mm mm
mm mm
it was at bedok eh not like punggol or something
yay
mm okay okay
okay lah I'm actually quite excited lah looking forward to it cause I don't know what to expect and the I think it's quite been it's been quite a long time since I last had steak
ya I think the last time we had steak was um last year at Elfuego
ya
in december
okay ah
I mean if lah I say and the view itself quite nice mah
okay
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
it's the middle of nowhere sia
but I didn't know EXPO is a view
ee
gross
I mean you can see lah from the pictures but you don't have to book
mm mm mm
oh serious ah okay
mm mm mm mm
oh okay okay
so they have an office there lah actually
ya it's true
sure lor
mm
mm mm mm mm understand understand
but there are some states just living in denial
mm
ah natural selection
mm
mmhmm
ah
no no no jail
why would you wanna jail them
you cannot jail people immediately just for that one incident what
ah
you think these people got no money meh to pay
mm
mm mm
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measures lah
ya except when I eat lah
orh
ya so there's there's rules and regulation lah it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
mm
ya must wear in case like people from the other um you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you ah getting that lah
mm
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed oh my god
the below the eyes cannot make it lah ah
okay I don't mind going there
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
uh
then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
arrow at work okay lah it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations
thanks thanks
I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
aha
ah same man
aww
ah
mm mm
ya accept me for who I am
ugh
I'm just saying it works both ways
mm
ya
no they don't talk lah during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
ah so they know how to
ya ya ya ya ah ah
ya
ah
then like and then I'll be like
adela I
ah
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
they also experience bad reception leh and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then kan
ya
video
mashallah
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
mm mm
oi
oh really when
all the best girl
okay
oh my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
oh my god it was painful I was like just
oh my god
ah
feel so hurt
eh but it really hurts ah it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist lah
what do you mean by lube
oh lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that one they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay lah
ya
it depends lah like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
ya ya correct
mm mm
ya so no worry lah I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check err about her the ovaries her uterus
then I was like
and then the lady just the reception's like madam fadilah I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
mm mm mm
ya
mm and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
ah Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
ya
so like then I didn't say lah I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting ah
mm
mm mm
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
eh eh
mm
seventeen
mm mm
I I no okay lah I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya oh my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
then throw outside lah
not strong ah
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
mm mm
ya
orh okay
I mean it's good lah then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball mah that's why
oh my god
oh my god

very conservative ah mindset

then I would be like shit
so I just like uh okay
and fahmi was so nice to send everybody home you know means canberra woodlands and then my house kallang
and then we go back
so I scared
like how I want to answer my mother

ya it's like a figures more shadow
whoa

mm
oh
uh huh
uh huh
small sink
okay
mm
uh huh
uh huh
ah ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
it it was moving
like you see the arms and all
ah ah ah ah ah
dishes
ah
oh oh
but you know if you think properly
you are blocking them you know
then the way you shout is obvious that you saw one thing
no
uh
ah ah
oh
hello
mm
okay the master bedroom toilet okay
ah
correct correct
ah
hey
okay why is it right your first instinct is to turn to it not to not
turn away from it
I saw you first
train
wah until now
until time ah
no but like at that point in time ah
oh
whoa
wah so weird leh
anabelle
oh shit
that one dig out the eyes
mm
ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
at the side table lah
okay when you say that there's obviously something
one last ah one last
ah
wah irritating ah playing around
ah
ah ah ah
correct correct
whoa
wah
short eh
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task tau which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
don't
and then have you heard any in okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is lah but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
like you what me you what you want me to do like
but hundred bro
bro hundred is fucking real bro
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
mm mm all the way down
ya so like the the part where
uh
ya like
ten O two
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
ya maybe so
with me
then there will be two of us correct
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say ah
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
uh you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so lasiri was sleeping
there is a scientific reason for all that what
then
when I say cannot ah will say no bro
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer what so she went to this one guy
hey bro
how you know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like eh maybe real siot
kan
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
uh ya same
and then they'll be like
hey

err
my my resume is err nonsense
err you know or or it's just that
my experience are no experience at all

then you cannot do much things and you don't have um
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then um

we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
the effects are there lah you know
err I don't think
kan
more of err like going through a war
not not like before this you know
constantly err doing things
be it err
err
you know all being um
stopped I would say that
ya
or or or the environment
of going through eh err things um
ah the things that we do
is err not doing very well right
they had an industry and the thing is
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
ugh
ya ya ya all the big err bars club
um
chill a little bit and them um
see what's going on and then from there
err
come to a point whether
and what not
time um everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
uh for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not um
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
um
it was haywire napster coming in you know
ah it was for for for consumer they will like it ah

okay
oh
okay
now it's D already disaster damage
devolution done uh last one is done lah
okay if let's say right for me ah if I plan eh sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing ah better don't plan just go you say like you will say uh if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle lah
ah that is for me
so in between like what's happening you have to be have own trust lah each other have their own trust
then just go mmhmm
okay
ah
okay I guess correct ya
hmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he no ya but I think for planning something hasty leave it up to me correct like for example when we went to get the house you shouldn't at decision that for example we want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
okay

um very straightforward what you want the colour
the wording
and the address already in detail and just let them design it you know what happen on that time
it's like they asking a lot of question like uh
this one uh did how to say eh they did ask a lot of question about the design we said this one want to be very simple we we we're not like fussy you know I was very simple we give them a sample already but they still do the wrong things eh
malay to malay you know I don't know how what language I want to say also not sure so this is the funny part but the funny is only one time you know lah the the next time ah I mean the next round I mean the next uh I ask them to redo again then the face change you know

because I I thought this one is a is a good in you know you can converse converse it very good because we can um the price is okay just that we cannot give they cannot give the result what what you want that's the problem I don't know why
in a lot of
they they actually translates from malay to english ang mo kio and correct the that's one of the reason why you don't want we don't want to take them on their we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day I was so fed up I just and then they cannot give me anything like I say you nevermind
ah correct
oh ya that's the reason
