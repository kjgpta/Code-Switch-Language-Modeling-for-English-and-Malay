you have to go to work tomorrow right
in the morning kan
ya
in the afternoon not in the morning lah
mm
production meeting eh
prepare for the production meeting at the the details eh
ya
ya bit busy month
but traditionally it's the busiest month for you right
traditionally for the past
twelve thirteen years right the demand december november december but not this year right because of COVID right ah
I see
what time will you be back do you think
okay cause I need to prepare lunch
and I want to I think the kids will definitely want
to eat the fish with you lah the
I don't I think for you is best to eat
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
why
ya
stretch the food even further the food we have lah
so I also don't want to waste food ah okay so tomorrow then you have to continue your work but you be working from home right you'll be studying from home right
the details ah
why take so long you still have to do research is it for each slide
that sounded like writing right it's almost like writing what
but you didn't put that much effort when you were write
I have to edit the what your write your your your what your article is is it your your assignment
two three pages but you know it's like
not it's not so bad it's not so badly done I mean I'm not trying to say you did it quite badly but
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
err who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like eh that's not the famous song from tokyo square
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the tokyo square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it ah
so tokyo square actually that
it's not a a got a tokyo square concert but they perform a few songs ah
uh because there are many other things that err at that show so tokyo square was one of them so I I I remember tokyo square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word tokyo slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
to america right they don't have
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is sukiyaki ah from what I know
that's the that's the unique thing lah that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin I need you
put us somewhere then she brought me with her lah so I think one of that that's why she know tokyo square
uh
they had this show they had this
ah so you remember lah
mm
uh the open space then they put up err the stage right eh um but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like what
uh
sam willows
uh
is there a song baby jane eh
uh
four
ah
uh
uh
ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese err medium right like the malay medium
err have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
uh on the side line lah it's like the a full time job for them
uh
I mean actually added actually actually them the I'm actually say it's the
is the the talent right
he was able to
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous what
ya
ah ya the malay medium lah but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like kit chan
at that she because she performed for cats even cats ya
ya
ya
not really a band not ya like but there is a talent lah like like the singapore talent ah
nuradi nuradi nuradi is a ah ya singapore talent
ya ya ya
astro eh
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this err
not fantastic lah not like ah zizan razak though
no I think
it's only people like ah zizan zizan eh
they are more exposure ya
the theater lah that the malaysia that we went to to watch the nadrah right
I remember when M nasir was talking to a
err hady eh hady mirza
for the
err what's the talent show eh
err M nasir so err hady mirza because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube lah I I I I watched through
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose lah
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think err err M nasir asked him err hady where have you been
because he was err wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work err
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem eh
like zoe tay and that time zoe tay was the were the in she was really the talent like pan ling ling
oh
her association
no I said if you want to go you can go with
no at that time lah
ah
pass away already eh
pass away eh
retired lah
how does it look like
oh
pointed out ah
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
she's just tired you know
and um
I think that's the main reason why they retire
eh even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine oh for you you are millennial I'm not sia
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
uh I am a generation X leh
it's really the you lah but you are not the the the the people that seroja and borshak was saying lah
the they were saying that this millennials ah lazy you know lazy ah
ya
ah
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
no she said people the
so
I think ten years eh twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even err make any profit
err around the same price as seroja
uh uh
uh
slightly more lah or around the same price lah
because she already bought a she already got err her flat
err her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
she want to because she love err cycling
I think she wants to cycle near the beach lah she doesn't have to
uh
ya lah but she has wonderful legs ah
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around uh ten years or so ah
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road eh
the amber road I'm not sure maybe ah
I think I I don't think is a new condo ah
uh uh
uh it's new it's new
uh
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
and not having to borrow money from the bank
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
oh my god sex heaven
condo kan
it's very very nice
uh
because I thought I I thought she stayed at serangoon garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
uh uh
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
huh
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask lah
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
especially french so I think it's something that they
uh
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very err thrifty lah sia
rent eh
uh
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
mm
that's why she move uh
make sense right
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo lah
uh
uh
uh
so they are a bit different lah their their the way they
their upbringing is different right
uh distinction lah uh
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so lah
uh
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best lah the best usually not them lah
uh I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace eh
she he ya
ya
he went to eton know that was his socialization tau
oh I uh my father owns a travel agent company
uh
uh and then
uh
uh huh
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
uh
this is doing you know
ah
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I I found out that he was educated at eton so I was like eton then dasha was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to err the people in eton but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the eton boys err russian lah
eton is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
ah ya
uh
uh huh
by russia ah no uh but uh
ya and and and the thing is is not just uh it's not just vietnam but also uh indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
err study in russia because russia uh uh study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year ah to brush up on her russia before she
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america uh it's recognise lah
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when err kacha was telling me kacha the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to sarawak or sabah
uh
huh
money
ah
malaysia hospital recognize
uh
but she cannot come and work here
uh
uh rundy his sister she studied in ireland right
no ireland not scotland
ah
ah
ah ah
to send her daughter to australia
the pace of life is different lah
uh uh laid back
she told me that
aiyo kartini what you think is so serious and important here over there is like
so laid I mean this is sofiani who finish his
paper like one week or two weeks earlier before the deadline you know this guy and he said that we really went over to australia he just learn how to be so laid back that he doesn't really care but I know
sofiani will find it very difficult to not care lah you know
ya he will care a bit but maybe not as much as before
ya
ya
I know your auntie have to challenge with
challenges with the egypt and jordan right
right with the girls right but the guys are the ones studying local
you know ahmad ahmad stays here
ahmad was like when he switched to secular right
adi secular
ah same as ahmad right
oh
ya
strength
their strength is languages uh
ya
ya
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test leh
ya but we we found out from my
err university of
jordan and the university of
not cairo lah err al-azhar
al-azhar
al-azhar
uh it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
they don't consider a degree for al-azhar a degree
uh
don't know allahu aalam
uh
uh
ya
uh wani eh
unless they do online lah unless they do online lah but I don't know al-azhar now not that good lah
the system of learning ah
err I think ever since the the egyptian spring ah uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time lah we know that the story lah
oh now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
uh but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
err at the
uh
err visa at the jordianian embassy ah
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran lah you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the fusha
that's the that's the thing lah so they get whatever they can
uh they can throw that at your face
you know but that is the the the nature lah but then you want to get the sadat eh they call it sadat you you want to get sadat so you do that lah
let her just stay here lah let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
uh
language is a bit hard lah
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
uh
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength ah
uh I mean I have friends who who like for example murni and I have a mutual friend
err okay lah one of our girlfriends lah
so I'm not that close to her lah because
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
uh
err
what what what she mean actually she mean err

thursday
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no lah I mean
we went to kaplan to register her
oh different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging oh no you cannot then you have to go this
ah
ah
it's exam-based also lah I mean written written exam
how many choices she have
but
line kan must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses eh
ya I mean with this combination diploma
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam lah kan
no choice
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
now is december
mm
orh
but part time will be what how many years three years
orh
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
her
orh
ah
then she's no more ah means she's tertiary student what
hmm
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this one is uh this one the
ah bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
ya
mm
but I mean does it change if
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things lah kan whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
one more year one more the amount you have to pay on it ya
don't waste timing
I said to him can that one is your pastime not your professional time
that depends on his portfolio
mm
so
there's something to do with maths also in in in photography
think cannot pause is it have to talk all the way is it until end
wah there's twenty more minutes to talk next subject
speaking about SAM uh
maybe if you open for english the franchise fee
I don't know you need to find out lah kan
samuel
that uh
pick up a teacher just do for english then if the teacher say okay you willing to come this time this time this time or not ah then if everything okay then okay lah kan
cause if they use two classes that means no place for us to sit around already cause the class
yours yours

you take take all
ah
and is uh people is enquiring

like that lah okay we okay uh we give a try for one month
but during the weeks ah during the weeks if we find it you are really not suitable
you don't want to waste your time we also don't want to waste our time
ah
we don't want to
kill the joy

eh then you pass by so fast eh
don't you think so like with COVID like wow where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling eh do you miss travelling
ya but if mm you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to uh
um like before COVID lah
new
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van wah love those time seh
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way lah you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van wah that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places lah
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya eh you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
eh but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience eh
oh my god
serious eh
okay okay okay
eh but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
mm
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match ah so my cousin and I didn't keep up
ah K
oh okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K lah at least you were sort of prepared for it lah to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
err melbourne was quite nice right eh or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it ah
like it was like an um
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
ah my god super super shiok
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
wow like that's an experience you won't get here seh
ya lah ya lah that's true lah
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also lah
ya more more expensive places err like
those I don't lame places lah like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
eh but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless what
that's true
eh but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know selangor pass selangor
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun eh but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that ah to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in lah like I need my dose of man
ah
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
oh ya never thought of that ah
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling lah
we drove that camper van right and then we got through err got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice what
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck ah to explore the ferry kan
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it lah
ya correct
ya correct
ya eh you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do lah but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh wow I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know ah oh it's just damn different ah or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had err more like
ya but if I had to pick
amorino K amorino is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and messina for the range
ya I think
ya because but wow messina has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything ah
gelato messina ah hands down ya
ah what what do you call it mm what was it like yuzu and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya mm
eh and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce wah best seh
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts seh
ya
mm
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
oh ya that's eh so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
uh I think it's the donut itself ah
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like wow oozing out ah
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something wow
wow like mind blowing seh
ya that was interesting ah ya
eh what what was that like curry curry eh
ah thai green curry eh
I I remember I remember there was something like um
ah plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice lah
oh to like caramelized the whole thing ah is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
oh K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually um in dragon's den as in
ah okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant prata over there lah
ya but ya lah I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there lah
mm
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like um things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember ah
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess ah I guess
ya
of course lah we had to what
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there ah even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot ah
and because those factory outlets kan have everything under one roof tau
bicester kan bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
oh and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain kan yes yes yes
eh it's a once in a lifetime chance seh we never know if we are going to pass by that place again lor
trying to recall lah
err
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty eh
fifty sing ah
ah okay eh what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then um
ya I just remember that that thingy ah what is it called ah
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to lah eh but the beaches there were nice eh
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
mm we really miss the nature ah
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya eh but malaysia nature not bad leh actually
ya
mm
no lah you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay lah I mean like okay langkawi has nice beaches
okay lah it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can ah while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have uh know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
oh
eh but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare ah
huh
so basically you were trying to catch your train err trying to catch your flight you mean
serious

uh
the
email right

it's not yet lah I think sooner probably I think maybe waiting for teachers
no they asking about you but okay lah
you all go and make your own plans lah we make plans
and after that we still need dessert and we still need coffee is they got so many things to talk about
you lah
what's yours
must be the crumbs lah don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I I expect you to go to the one at bugis the bigger one
ah that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
oo that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
eh
you have to wait equipment first ah
oo I thought they pay for you
who
huh you know you have a friend but you don't know who
oo
oo
you saw him or he told you are
oo
what you mean they have different different team eh
err
okay lah think can you can make it lah
ya lah
lah whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first lah while waiting for something that you used to do
lah
later the zoom
you do alone eh I I don't need to join you okay
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
the first to teach err tasha
get the malay students to love
malay
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
so that's why I think it's a great loss err and she's there I think according to tasha it's like what she's only there for three years
so tasha was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one lah
uh
tasha is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
tasha is the first batch she teach three years lah
three years eh five years
ya initially tasha doesn't like her what
but in the end
a'ah see
her class what
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is nadia she pick and choose
it will affect her this what I notice ah
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around lah
because I think
tasha tasha also what
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
which now you don't expect her to dance lah she's got no interest already
nadia my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that oo tag rugby
oo touch rugby tag rugby
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego ah the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active lah she is like she is active since young so
she's daring lah she she has the confidence
can lah let her try lah
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store lah tasha tasha hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs lah
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set what knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay lah
it belongs to tasha or belongs to her
then it should be able to lah and tasha use
should be lah it's kids size what
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
eh she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
err going bishan on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff
going bedok saturday eh
I know that's why she said come on saturday because she's not going to jurong so everybody's there
sunday is a brothers in law second marriage
eh
they detect eh this saturday wow it's handy
so fast

nineteen
today is nineteen see
I'm not working I still can get the dates right
I buy something lah
later you get tasha to I think we have nuggets hashbrown finish
fries finish
nuggets only then maybe if you want desperate lah
the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch ah
the whole box
try try not to give so much ah they're coughing
haris haris haris coughing
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you lah see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast lah
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway lah but she haven't message me
peck seah P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start err preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time lah the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind ah if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition what
amirah's err siblings they have tuition
ah
I thought amirah go for err oo visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
uh but math class
my only worry is nadia's math I mean ya now she's average ah but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is tasha cannot help much also with maths
at least science
err english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind lah
at least if we start her early because we started tasha like only in P five
right started tasha with five
hmm
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as tasha
ya she did
okay lah
together

don't know lah ah I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
sixteen march eh

okay lah spend money in singapore lah staycation now government give ah hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel lah I think you have to book to those but five platform only
the places that you want to go err places of interest or staycation
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass ah and then from there then you can use lah you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
okay lah they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore lah but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one lah so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period ah
eh
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo jurong bird park sentosa I don't want lah so all these places went already ah so I need to go something different ah maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night ah maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels lah you want to go those like hotel ah of course you need to come out still same price lah not much difference ah anyway

ah so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing lah
huh
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah lah example ah one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
be quite too expensive or what
no
huh
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
huh I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then uh hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up what then what's the point of
huh
bullshit
huh
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive what right so why is the other way round
what the
really happen
until now ah
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
oh that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better what
funny ah
why ah like that
anyway
ya
ah ah
ah and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars oh my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe ah maybe whoever pick up that story ah and then share share share share ah
I do not know ah shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is johor one is woodlands so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet ah whoever pick up that story ah go viral ah
no lah he I think yes he no eh
this year ya correct correct because right right right
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual err wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel kan for him
ask his wife to come singapore ah bring in
he is going back to johor
so he's
then after that he's
oh he is going back johor now
then
no pay leave two months lah singapore no pay leave two months ah
ah then after that bring in the wife come singapore
huh
oh ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia johor you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation lah
but singapore
the the the cases zero what community wise why go there still still need to
subsidise lah
I mean if if if now err the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go johor knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
funny lah they all anyway
it's okay lah at least happy for him lah at least you know see his wife
mm
investment lah it's good investment lah
ah
ah
ah
the two weeks
that one two weeks two weeks you stay worse
you never join the apps ah they got apps like zumba lah exercise lah yoga
ah then
I also do other things also at the same time I also helping my my
friend doing this err food
so now we are
for what
okay
ah
ah okay lah
ah
ah I see okay lah
ah so call like a whole set lah
ah
okay okay okay
so he did that also lah
but now because of this COVID thing lah
so for me nowadays you you see my new family cusina
oh ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing ah because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation eh whereby if let's say you go to
thai vietnamese
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
ah is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and err gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place lah be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put err err err
different taste local of a filipino taste lah so yes we did that already so alhamdulillah there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
home made ah
hopefully lah
a'ah
ah
correct
ah
ah
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully lah ah be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet lah because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first uh uh
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it err
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert lah then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
okay lah good lah I was thinking
correct
true
ya lah
so ya lah so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully lah hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit lah
so I I I I will add you don't worry I will add your I know who is this toklang right should I accept should I not this is a scam later somebody I also do not know then after that add already ah this one ah could you give me money this one transfer here oi so many nowadays so that why I worried since you say that is your account I will accept and I will add you
ah that's why I was thinking alfi already got the account what so this one is this one is err new account the other account get hack or what I also do not know but
I will accept that don't worry then I will add you to a dot J underscore kusina or kitchen kusina kitchen
ya
from the house itself lah so probably now also weekend right so nobody wakes up early what
right
then the order
okay lah but then
from ten to maybe two lah today
then
aduh
uh I thought somebody want to come out summon what
ya lah can one
then after this you straightaway go
do do grab already ah I mean do do deliveroo already ah
ah
ah
ya true true
and ah for me today oh today I think I go back later I still need to I just another order coming today banana bread with chocolate melts
that means the banana bread you cut that banana bread inside there is chocolate melts
whoever order this one because no I I do I mean friends or whoever wants to order from me right I mean there are
food I mean standard lah default default like I do this okay that means for example banana cake or I do strawberry cheesecake cups with blueberry cheesecake cups
so these are the standard item standard food but if let's say you want to have something extra inside like example banana cake is just banana cake so someone ordered
ashraf can I ordered banana cake with chocolate melts inside
can
the other guy wants the chicken which is
super spicy different from these three they want something like spicy spiciness how lah this spicy okay lah can lah I can do for you so it's
can be done lah not say cannot be done it can be done like muffin also we do the same what we have blueberry
we have err blueberry muffin banana walnut muffin
uh chocolates muffins so even to have something different can lah we customised to
your tastes lah ah ah so ya we do that lah alhamdulillah lah so today
there's order later five so still have time to go back
and then do cooking ya so we we try to do during I mean
uh we we can't take too much order yet because of
both of us working and then err you know so we
try to take those like during the weekend in advance lah so at least we we can prepare in advance the food the ingredient ya plan plan out what are the things that we need to prepare lah
uh so
I think they came down from from slope correct because err I think behind us is all those private houses right I think there's those err
trail lah so I think there is ya ya ya there is a trail out there so
ah
eh
don't reject too much people know later bukit timah why bukit timah ah so many rejection oh something after night ah something spooky so I don't not want to go up it's it's not spooky lah it's just that the feeling ah there's a feeling like
so dark what all those expats ah
all the
huh
orh those banyan banyan banyan tree those one is the like hair hanging out from the leaf
ah
I don't know a lot of histories out there lah so a lot of people like rider like all those I see bicycle know going up to do cycling saturday sunday a lot cycling places ah but very quiet lah
ah
can lah can lah okay okay okay eh nice nice catching up ah with you ya okay okay maybe next time we meet up again lah talk again K okay okay ciao ciao bro okay okay thanks thanks take care take care okay bye bye

okay
so
hi
uh this is madir and this is my speaking partner zaini
um zaini say something
hi okay so let's look at the prompts um
ah
how are you today
okay
okay so let's
ah
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay lah that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
uh the
oh the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but uh it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow lah but
I suppose um ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind um
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect um you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult lah and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
uh
ha okay
ya
uh huh
uh huh
huh okay
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house ah
huh
ya ya what do think of the house ah
mmhmm
keep talking ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean for me ya lah I mean it's I do feel
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to kan like I mean like I've always been living in yishun
and then now moving to tampines so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me lah ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
mm
ya
ya lah
ya
uh okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions lah it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
uh huh
uh first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know uh really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand lah
and then the second
would be obviously
oh but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
hmm
mm
like would be health
um you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
uh and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
um
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only lah but the buttons ge ge which is good lah
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
hmm
iran
yang paling digemari
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like mm ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that one was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
um we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
mm where they were that was really really very nice and then um
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went tehran
we didn't have a guide like what we had uh in isfahan and yazd
eh no no no we didn't have yazd it's shiraz sorry ya
but
ya lah we didn't have a guide lah
would have been nice lah if we had a guide ah but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
huh
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to bordeaux so many times
oh ya
mm
cranny
mmhmm
uh biarritz
no yes we did we went to biarritz we went to cannes
yes
then from bordeaux we went ya we went to uh dune du pilat
and then we went to biarritz
ya and then we went to arcachon ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
uh huh
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course lah it has to be attractive in my way lah
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
hmm and you know the person's kind of vibe ah not not not personality or character lah because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well ah
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go deep
yes ya
yes
eh no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
soalan pertama fahamkan anda
no
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
mmhmm okay
why
uh huh
ah okay
uh huh
uh
um
design
uh
um
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
uh would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question um
okay
uh
uh
uh talented
I have no idea what talented means uh is in in in malay um
uh
ya tom holland
mmhmm
ah
uh huh
actually
uh huh
okay um
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right um how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
um
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could um not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample um opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
um
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
um
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know uh make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree uh unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done wah
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
ah oh
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like uh rustic to me
okay
actually kan
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
eh thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly ah
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
um
uh
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place
just
you know the wall
actually I was thinking ah like dining area
or just this wall
just this wall
the store wall
okay lah
okay lah just leave it plain lah then I can put paintings
no lah I honestly I I don't like lah I mean like
not not the wall lah

mm
huh
seven days
your your syllabus eh
ah two year okay lah alhamdulillah
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
how the worst
but is it reported to the authorities or not

don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
um I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand ah most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together ah
oh berry van eh
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya lah so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then lah my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya um and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
ah despite my aunts' protestations
and ya lah so he jump ah he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply lah kan you got there
and once you are done ya lah I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand um
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match ah so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
err
eh did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
ah was that the first time I felt snow
err
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun lah
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine eh
ya
K lah how chocolate is the best lah
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
ah apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
woo shiok ah
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food ah kan
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
err
ya
um you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
um you can even decide on the spot that hey I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way um
what they do is they drive
to penang
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border oh you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
krabi or fly to phuket
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay lah I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience lah of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship lah kan
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no lah I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm lah
ah
oh ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas ah
um there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers ah that's why
ah meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from ah
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
mm ya
and the best donuts in the world
eh do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis lah the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
um
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique um overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay lah I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world lah
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya oh and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains eh
did they grill that one grill kan
I think it was grilled and then they put um brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that ah
ya that one
eh there was something that I thought about um oh oh oh oh oh oh um london um
the devil brownies ah
ya that was a random find ah no we went to that
that weekend market
um I wouldn't say it's a random find lah because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
ah correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there err these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons ah so these dragons are
um so ya she pitch her brownies to them ah
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
err she used that as part of her advertisement lah
ah but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
ah noodle oodle um that's just
soup ah
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos ah so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
ah the price the price is way cheaper than nandos ah
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab ah
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
ah yes
eh the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name ah a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice ah
ya what else ah
what else was nice that we have
oh buffet that that buffet was power
eh that was a nice chance upon ah
that was not in our initial plan lah because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
um ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay lah it's a saving grace lah
it's a saving grace because I think
um those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles ah
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian lah at least oh that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
kan
ya cheaper lah ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands err on prada
understand ah it's still thousands eh
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay lah
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major lah the and the two australia
ah
oh
err
slide down the slope ya
best ah
fifty
mm
oh
ya
the beaches err jog my memory again where did we go
oh sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay lah I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
um
oh oh ya ya ya
ah
but it's hot ah
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have err
two thousand let me recall ah when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
um we went to travel around the areas lah so we went to spain um
specifically we went to madrid lah
so err I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
mm ya
um I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one um
so when we reach belgium
um we thought that the bus station uh at that belgium to the airport was quite near lah
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely ah
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
um
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour lah but sixty kilometres away ya kan so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there ah
this was the start lah almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated lah we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind ah he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind err I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros lah basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation kan
and then by the time we reach there he
uh maybe three quarters ah
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got lah and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed lah maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey ah
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight lah but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and uh I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you lah
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid lah ah but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
err I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think ah
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
ah so dah happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
oh I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each ah
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it ah
ya
power ah
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ah like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
ah yup
true
who came up to us
say assamualaikum and started to err to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said oh actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working ah so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then um you know went back went to spain to work lah
ya working overseas is something
okay lah not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months ah of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close ah but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome ah to the point that I felt that hey
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both ah
okay so um when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
um the or the muslim students association they were quite
um vibrant and there are very active lah
so um I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them lah
because when I were went there also um
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short ah

um
ah so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
uh huh
so other than
when you
ah yes so is so now when you see for yourself eh actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
ah I enjoy eating it which is something good lah kan hopefully
you can cook ah more things lah
ah exercise more ah exercise more in the imagination lah in reality I won't exercise
ah yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
eh this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya lah ten years ago still can play lah but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play ah maybe
ah if I play football with
ah I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become lah
doubt so lah I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it lah don't want to waste my energy ah
during the malaysia cup ah
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over lah first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
ah whom is like
and the passion is just not there lah I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities ah
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
ah football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame kan then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
ah in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
ah I can just ah imagine myself to be ronaldo or messi
on the screen
kan if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers kan
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things ah um
uh huh
yes
ya so that is the different lah people change
kan so maybe certain things will be left behind lah
ah
ah
ah
ah
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time lah kan cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
ah impossible ah kan ah
okay um
yes
ah behind kan then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
ah just nice for his ah
or his or her development
in the future lah even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
ah ah
yes correct
ah
um
ah
ya lah
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
ah
ah but in terms of travelling
ah malaysia kan
ah ah maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia ah
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
ah um
ah favourite place ah favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay lah our singapore dollar is strong lah then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe kan
but it's a really complete
uh shopping lah
for the clothes only lah
ah
ah
ah
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay kan but of course there is there different lah when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new kan but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is ah is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also lah kan
uh but
yes ah
ah ya lah you will set the goal when you go ah
ah ah
ah I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part lah kan
I mean
ya lah I think certain things you are more
ah
comfortable in handling and
ah certain things I am more comfortable in handling lah I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
ah planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
ya lah ah when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
ah then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
ah
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay lah
ah
we are realistic lah kan what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over lah I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small lah but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it kan so that is the difference
ah ah
ah ya
I think for the jakarta one
when we reach
there we were like eh
first thing is the airport lah
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
err shopping centres err in the eighties kan
so okay lah that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
uh
ah
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
ah something being kept for so long
it's not rotten ah it's like the carpet never wash for so long
ah lah
quite enjoyable lah in jakarta the
different way of life
ah
yes
yes our wedding
ah our wedding planner ah

just for the sake of
ah getting err
cheaper cheaper price ah kan

we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore

basic necessities are there in terms of the the cleanliness of what you call it you know the cleanliness
ah we have a driver yes
a'ah
a'ah
yes ah
kuta beach ah
it it is the way they set up the kuta beach
is like trying to follow gold coast ah so it's like this one is gold coast
ah in indonesia lah gold coast bali
ah the way they set up but of course a bit different lah first the
the cleanliness of the beach
a'ah
ah ya motorcycle ah ah mm
a'ah
into the sea ah ya ah
yes ah
the water is not so
so blue lah in compared to gold coast
ah gold coast the water is blue but now got sharks
mm mm
a'ah
a'ah mm

ah mm
we took almost ah half a day

a'ah
yes
ah that's the first trip ah
that is the first time I met
raja and ah ah I think for you first time meet lina ah for me first time I meet both
ah can click kan a'ah
ah
ah mmhmm
ah
malaysia ah
a'ah
yes ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
older lah ah older
but the penang one could have been better cause if not raining
four families cut down to three ended up to two kan ah
ah
if there is a travel restriction
ministry of foreign affairs will be alert
and they will say
ah advise people not to go there ah a'ah
yes
I enjoy the food down there
ah
home of P ramlee
penang yes
ah ah
ah
ah like very interested to talk to to us eh ah
ah
ah yes that one is the the tower
ah ah ah eh they say what
they emphasise as the biggest
the biggest curve
in southeast asia
ah it's the biggest
ah
ah scared of heights ah
ah
but if I yes
ah
ah that time the new attraction they haven't finish doing yet ah the new attraction they
you can be you can I think you can do flying fox a short
flying fox lah then outside the building
that one they haven't finish yet ah I think if that one already have I think you can forget it about raja going on it lah ah
that one is the bukit bendera
ah ah yes
ah][ah um)(um
ah ah ah um
ah ah ya
but it was very bad remember that time even then malaysian chief
the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van kan we can see the certain places which was
ah damaged lah due to the due to the flood
ah then one thing about penang ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building kan which is ah a bit
but
conserve for the sake of ah conserving ah sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them lah cause they did conserve their ah
upside down museum ah um
singapore rediscovery vouchers ah
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal ah then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so lah other countries we cannot control kan
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it lah eh
at least meet up so we won't be so
ah no new cases ah
a'ah
ah ah shopping centre
ya lah ah
kan ah disposable shoes disposable clothes then
okay so other than travel
ah in year twenty twenty one lah kan lah what would be
your wish your hope in twenty twenty one
mm
ah primary two hopefully he will do better than in primary one
ah
mmhmm mmhmm yes
family members ah ah
so other than that for me is err ah
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
ah maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated lah trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority lah and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue oh then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
ah
a'ah
ah
eh lah
a'ah
mm
ah
ah yes
ah
ah
ah yes
ah cousin ah
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best lah
I I submit document I submit application
ah
ah
the thing is is like that
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother lah kan
have to go through a lot of places lah
the future
you have to go through a certain
authorised by us to do the ah assessment so go through check up again
so um um
ah ah
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done kan
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then ah
I think now is
ah
involved ah uh huh
ah do the best that he can be ah
enjoy enjoy what
ah make try to make his life ah
meaningful lah that is what
ah
ah
ah ah
a'ah
a'ah
um um um
um um um ah
um um a'ah
eat lah ah
a'ah
poly ah
uh ah
a'ah
a'ah

wow mine is louder
K can
K ready
okay let's start
ah yes
ya lah we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya lah
ya so I think what we can do we don't go uh we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual lah we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in ah
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay lah uh we can take the the voucher ah you want to buy the voucher ah meaning we have to go uh the
err
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course ah
no lah the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before what just like the night safari
the four items ah the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
err
think eleven plus ah
oh uh wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge ah seven plus to nine
two you uh ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this one right
uh we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going what you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go lah
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also lah can
the three of them
but if affaf don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two lah
then it's two two each
Subway
mm ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough lah don't know ya
have to
is the camera uh waterproof
don't have ah
can
her studies finish already what her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
err
affif I think he doesn't want to go down
eh what
twentieth right
the following week lah after christmas
can eh no cannot
yes uh uh
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have ah not open yet ah okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups lah so the kids
all the children
add up uh
it's just nice
force lah
monday
that's why first person to check is aisyah
but if you I I don't know whether
err
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say lah you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
uh ya lah there is a few suggestion lah one is
um we split into two groups
so one group is maybe uh
ya
go to the one that is more lah kan
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there lah
so affif affaf shafie three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind lah because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya lah
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many uh eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line ah and it's too um
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
ah
amin I mean we all have been coming over
we ah mahir because the other time his family come over amin come over amin the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how ah
uh
ya lah uh we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest amin would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
uh at one time at one go
and then err
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay lah then after that
of course lah
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
ah apply
just that maybe amin uh only
the two older eh umar also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if umar is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
mm
right okay so what else ah do you want to talk about um
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya lah
very difficult
ya cannot one
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone what we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options lah so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay lah at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that one
no the problem is
all others in singapore lah unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to what
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
um the problem with all other uh uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's uh and her lecturer one whom she took the last course kan
then she the lecturer actually say um
that
a topic module not on in these two uni lah
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write ah ah correct
so she's uh worried about the that part lah that's why
uh huh ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya lah
they actually have it leh the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants ah
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
err
mm more working people are opting for that course more working people tau meaning people who are
let's say they uh they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us lah she uh or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student ah so she will be like considered as an adult already lah
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say uh
err income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
ah but actually that one not much lah
of course lah because she is ah
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
uh
ya lah
like that lah
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have uh all these other
unis ah which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
oh my god that's why I was
ya lah because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating lah
ya so that one actually I thought uh I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya lah
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things lah so and she went in they were all telling her oh you know uh this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like affaf are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop uh
K so
we need another
ya we need another uh
round of her checking lah ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya lah
that's what he wants to do
so
ya lah she
lah
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based lah so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics lah right that's physics right
so more about physics
ah so you learn how to make
the uh you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya lah you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
um
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application uh by this person
who wants to uh uh okay because I put up uh a post
ah resale
ya okay so two ah one is about the
um recruitment
uh I put
teacher coach uh at SAM lah
so so far
uh
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she uh she apply but we are maths kan so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
ah that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because uh we already signed up what it's for free at that point in time lah
uh when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say uh this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
uh about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
ah
switch her lah
ya
ya lah paying the teacher only
correct lah
so okay lah so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
um a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
oh my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run ah let it run ah
so the partnership confirm don't want ah so I will message to say don't want ah
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya lah the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
ah
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right ah
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue lah from there kan
okay so
progress report I told ira to do that already
ah the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to ira right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of ira you said to ira directly
I was there so I think it's okay lah let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out lah
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give uh first week july then we didn't give
so this one at least we give lah everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya lor
but then
buy over then he buy over lah
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
uh for uh the person who takes over is a full time
owner
tau so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved lah
uh in
ya sort of like that lah ya correct
but I was thinking actually no lah uh yang was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut lah so I think he can
ya lah he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said lah a bit
you know I said uh uh in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot ah then I say during and all ya ya ya
uh I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only ah I can understand a bit but
uh chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say oh because
uh nearby our place uh it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so uh a lot of uh
uh
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
ah
then then uh because of that
um we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
oh okay okay but now got Google translate what
can just uh tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear lah
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say oh but the children can speak english what so the children can explain I say yes
um we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had uh chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy lah
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just oh okay
ah ah
ah that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct lah ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be uh with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
uh uh he's a graduate
ah
so he was working
uh but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
oh okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe lah
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like oh okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better uh candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
ah so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
err do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well uh and and starts in his course lah so he was saying
he understand children uh who have difficulty in maths lah he can he can relate so he knows uh
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya lah
ya lah so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said lah give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit lah sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method
is more suited for a big classroom you in front of the class
ya
ya
ya K lah can we will
tell that to the
to the boy tomorrow
ah
okay lah so at least we have
so if let's say he okay

okay start
okay just
the slides all need to complete by by tomorrow lah I do not know whether have
enough time to complete by by tonight lah

how it goes from one one slide to the other and then the information must tally or it must link
ya but
ya lah then when I
mm
err okay lah
mm

for the help lah
mm
ya yup
not too familiar lah but okay
uh
okay
mm ya lah
okay so oh but what what he wants but why but why he wants so
oh okay
oh okay
mm
ya lah
not really
mm
oh okay
ah
I see
not really ah
so far was sam willows jer ah sam willows I I hear
and then after that
that's it lah
maybe err
sheikh haikel lah
maybe sheikh haikel music and maybe some
actually not really ah singapore band not singapore don't have
much
the malay group
ya
overseas the jam lah but those those err there's a few there's few groups those few groups that they did perform in singapore there is usually about one or two song but
not really that famous you know I have a few few friends that they they make
something along that line lah so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight lah
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job lah
so they are not that famous lah
but
err but ya lah I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
mmhmm
ya lah the
but it was mostly malay songs lah malay songs
mm ya lah she's more more of a
like theatre
like those you know voice not not really a band kind
ya
ah fazil
nuradi is it nuradi
mm
huh who
uh not too sure
talent train ah
mm
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay lah but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
err the jokes are more for singapore centric lah not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that eh maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
mm
mmhmm
ya lah I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya and then they no lah they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya lah but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months what
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
the talent show singapore idol
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh the voice ah sometimes like the voice lah
ya ah
ya
no lah the it's a draw what it's a draw
mm
ya lah I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again ah where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also what
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe tay is from my alma mater eh she was from yuan ching secondary
no she was way way way much my senior lah but
it's like the school very proud of her lah
yes of course
yuan ching
she wouldn't err declare
err she you know fanfare ah because yuan ching is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what ah then then she'll flaunt it
yuan ching
yuan ching ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
amin
but now COVID don't have already lah
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already lah
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no lah most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
eh ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression lah I mean
they they have to retire what once they they hit their sixties
have the energy lah
professorship
ya lah I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial ah
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch lah
ah
ah ah
even my brother is millennial
my brother naz
so naz is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation lah
no she she got uh she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot lah but
but if she can if she can you know err ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya lah but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation lah I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made err
make a profit lah but the thing is if she
ya lah about one point one million lah but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
mm
how much she bought it
but her one is at simei right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand uh
thirteen years ago
mm
oh
oh okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand lah
huh
so just just
uh amber road
ah
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal lah because err
oh so new lah
well that's a risk
development
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya lah
but her place second floor
what one point
oh
her main bedroom
oh cause so it's quite big lah
ya okay but
uh huh
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
dasha when she can save more money right
mmhmm
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person what
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
mm
mm ah
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more what if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored lah then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means err in the embassy one is paying for her living space eh if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay lah maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya lah but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury uh apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense what
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people lah
say about thousand plus ah ya maybe ah
okay
if six person ya lah if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya lah make sense lah
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy lah one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy err is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya lah I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo lah so that
they are being sheltered lah
fixed condo
ah
ah
ya lah ya lah
mm mm ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they uh being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but err when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference ah cause
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes err what drives what drives people
mm
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
err flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
mmhmm
how much
ya that's quite a lot
oh eh so he's the degree lah
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
uh huh
oh okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
eton what's a eton
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore lah
oh
depend on the area lah depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese leh
he's err he knows err he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese err they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area lah maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence ah
mm
huh russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
uh huh
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
oh malaysian malaysia hospital lah
oh okay and then then okay lah
ah
oh why ah
wasted kan
medicine also medicine what
oh
oh okay
eh oh err rundy rundy
rundy rundy
uh ireland or scotland ah
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand ah
four hundred thousand
mm
ya
mm
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait ah can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
mm
I think the highest I heard is jer lah
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback ah
uh
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge ah
uh huh
ah ah
uh huh
I think ya lah because the the guys are not
no no the the
err secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
ah because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which ah no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences ah
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan
cairo
al-azhar lah
then
mmhmm
oh really
okay then
okay
how come it's like that ah
okay then how about
oh
if it's not recognize then because she she don't want to take
and then the the mother wants her to take right
but now after COVID after COVID she
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's actually quite
quite sad lah
cause the amount because there's some
ya I mean that's quite
unfair lah but
the amount of effort and they put
but in the end err she should've finish already right
uh why no good
egyptian arab spring arab
ya lah I mean
mm but
it's kind of sad lah that that wani that control all those things and then
let's say if if she's not recognise cannot get a good salary job then it's also quite
quite a pity lah but luckily the sister did land with parkway east which is quite good lah that you know
huh really
okay
oh I don't know I'm not part of the facebook
ah
ah ya ya correct
uh huh
okay

no but then how does she knows about the dialect she how
ya but she cannot she cannot take
mm
uh huh ashtray ah
wait then okay nevermind lah
mm
okay
so you just want to let her
ya lah
most probably no lah I think
I think depends on
what's her appetite is lah
eh
well nevermind let her let her develop see which one she inclined to maybe she likes more sciences
depends lah in in the future we never knows because a lot of things also can can change one
but
how good is her
her maths err results
ya lah but her results shows that
I mean she's okay I mean not bad
but I think her malay is is better lah her malay is is picking up
ah
ah
ya but that one only when the all the ah
mm ya

err
ya
kan
in order ah so uh
like
keep up with the
academic lah
I ah
um
ya
how how how do I
how do I do this question and like
what what what concept that I don't understand ah just ask what concept I don't understand
uh formula ah
mm err
ya
mmhmm
some bluetooth speaker
err
the bluetooth speaker requires a
power source and
a device that has bluetooth
so

and the
the you can play any anything like music or video video audio
and and the and the
bluetooth speaker will will

code a scenario
that that the that the teacher given
then err must present
then
and then
and it must be the project must be err presented in
and the deadline lah
ya
no as as in like
err
and it like program ah like
they give you a a certain scenario where like
that like you have to
like the output must be
must be what they expect lah like example they give you a a
example they give you a table like a statistic they uh you have to use your your knowledge of
you have to use your knowledge of err programming that you have learnt during class and then you have to you have to in the input you have to quote in what you've learnt and then at the output right you it must be the the same as what they expect in the question in the scenario
err
ya
mm mm
mm

they didn't
a prototype about
about a certain problem like for example
uh uh you have
you have problem with your earpiece like
like
you you have to wear earpiece where you
where your earpiece err wire always always like

mm
mm mm
mm mm

mm
mm
I think shallow first ah
because
because like
um
I have never
I always like
stay near the shore and then I don't go
uh further because I scared that
that's
that's why I I I don't go
very very far from the shore

very far when when my cousin brought brought me
carried me and then
and me to the furthest part
uh furthest part that I've that I've went
dia
uh wait
like
he carried ya carried
uh

uh
like my I don't know lah my my heart
my heart is too weak
for
for me
like I like I I'm scared like
like I'm gonna drown or something
mm mm
uh uh
mm
ya
slowly gradually yes go
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya ya my fear is also height lah because
there was this
uh
sky walk in
uh I
for me there was a
there was a sky walk in camp
uh uh camp in in
when I was primary four there was a camp and then I have to participate in this uh
sky walk and then and then I took the longest time to finish the course because
cause it was really scary for me and then it was
really high
uh huh
mmhmm
mm
I
no I was I was
okay nice
thank you bye bye

my side recording
five four three two one
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these leh I don't think this err all the researchers I think it's okay lah to all these to talk about all these things ah I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
a'ah
mm
mm
mm
uh uh god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks err assuming one game a week lah
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per ah for the whole tournament kan then we take just ten percent that's uh between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour lah outside lah now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out lah but whatever it is at least eh the whole tournament um one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
uh I drop it in discord
ya so
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
um I just didn't know
you know the this league not worth it seriously
ah
ah
en
mm
ya
ah
mm
mm
a'ah
a'ah
ah ah
mm
mmhmm
ah exactly exactly ya
mm
ah
ah
mm
mm
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point lah is that social media aspect lah so
but um the social media aspect of a one off thing eh
err
ah ya
ya
ah
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and ah we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio eh how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not ah
mm mm
hmm hmm hmm maybe maybe who knows maybe
mm
mm mm
mm
I
ah okay all the tournaments then
you know so
ya so
mm
mmhmm
mm
err five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know err so err or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that ah we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool eh wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off tau this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
mm
mm
ya correct
uh huh
ya okay
uh huh
ya
mm
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say eh we do everything for every
let's say every saturday lah eh every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get err thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have um four four prize winners
each of the prize winners err okay and then at least err total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright um
or we could just put it every every week err the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number lah K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
okay a'ah and then like this ah we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool lah basically lah alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say eh thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
ya
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that lah so let me get up my word pad my notepad ah so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
oh six eight
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually ah we can't do that maybe top eight ah top eight get five percent lah
yes
ah
ya get a wise five uh eh
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
uh huh
a'ah
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent ah
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great lah okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
K
um
ya
eh of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is lah whatever amount
there will really get people to like eh siala if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at eh I only pay five dollar registration fee tau I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
a'ah correct
so that's it we need to have at least
um
um
okay but that's why okay you um then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
mm mm
mm true also true also difficult ah
mm
sixty four possible
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
en
mm
so this idea eh is basically if I were to go to N
en
err but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them kan they're all out for it
his words lah
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
let me
ah
let me try and see if I can find err
err what's that called lah
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
err basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations ah
it's a it's a carbon copy
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then err this err will have err the our
what I'm afraid of eh is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about lah like
err like um even when I I told her the idea look ah why not err we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these tau she want us to be on our own
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event tau
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african lah
that's the number one thing ah
yes
ah
ah
mm
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor lah
a
ah
ah
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible um you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all lah you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
err potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
um
ya ya correct
a
uh huh
a
you will have your own you know shout out lah you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising ah a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events eh is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they err how to say that the
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer lah in a way lah
it's the same as advertisement ah so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
mm but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head eh I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay err so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us lah okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
mm
yup mm mm mm
so
ha ha
a'ah sia
alamak
alamak
okay
okay
ya
okay
um
there's another
ah correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports lah
one play E sports
pure err pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
mm
ya the singapore premier league a week ago err three point eight K views
mm
err what's that called
okay E singa cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
err E singa cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs ah
for the one V one E singa cup
one V one E singa cup
oh they split it into
the whole league
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands ah early thousands
you know so ya
oh shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
ah
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel err you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
ya that would that would really help
because eh if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just err aiman giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then err what's that called ah ya and then like this ah people will be alerted
ya
exactly
ah correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because ah I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
ah
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
a
ya
um
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
you know and all we want eh it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
or whatever we can uh we can get lah we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
ah ya so
mm
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who sekaiichi is ah they just look at pure viewership numbers ah we can talk about them eh we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
ah
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because um and you know really likes to work together with me lah basically lah
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA lah so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there lah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm ah
okay so
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
who do they have

yes
what was just now your meet up

just that singapore don't have that

but you didn't really wear it right
how much did you buy it for
eh how can you buy second hand

why I was asking ilya then when I
he refuse to do it because he says is a holiday
no lah didn't sort
I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset what like last time also holiday is like finish up the
um
assessment book that kind but the thing is right um
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like um
uh
oh like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like hey I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like huh maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
okay okay and uh
that's usual lah cause ilan was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you what
timetable kan
like like she can even ask me like when I said
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
eh err one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me err is it err minus or plus
ya ya ya that kind of thing
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff lah
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her ah
is like
ya lah the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he
I felt that he wrote it slightly differently lah formally but
to me
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson
okay
huh
huh got such thing ah
ya
the only time I went there is the scholarship lah but
it's so far
um
ah ya did you go for it

and
you sit in front
and you block people's view
ah that's true that's true they all caught up and then
um
so jialat ah I don't know ah I don't know but I always see you in malay class what
malay class I sit slightly far
eh do you know who's nuryanti
nuryanti do you know
yanti ah the one express of the A uh
forgot the name of this guy what
you do not ah
oh oh ya
ya
err the first eldest is boy lah then the rest is all girls
in my school
recently he say she gave birth
I had know number five or um same age as me I don't know number five or number four ah
so it's like hush hush I totally didn't know she was pregnant lah
then like eh are you okay
it's a boy
then she was like
and then she
ya lah
mm then um
then uh then after that she was like
no no no Facebook I am not
ya I was like what
cause she didn't think she will have another one ah
was like eh really you know just like two weeks ago that kind I just giveaway a lot
mm ya
bukit panjang
it's not between me and my family it's between it's the both of them what it's their it's their property
it's up to her err she made plans with the other agent
you know right because changi has a team then he the rental he give so I was like actually he sells
but she already give to I don't want bad blood lah
that she wants to such told the rental agent
ya but
you know when
mm
what has changed
mm
the calculations whether it's better
yup
I don't know I don't know what is
oh really but when is it going to ah
no plans to move what do they expect to
then the only way is to rent lah
because they cannot you cannot buy in time what it's gonna be end of the year
I don't know man
ya did he mention like
ya another two more minutes
fast
ya please please and
ilya first
just now when did err why did uh your friend calling me
mm
confidential stuff
confidential stuff
mm

oh so this one is um actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding kan
tru
um but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
oh ya lah that one I think normal lah since my time many years ago also same also lah the thing ya so I think uh ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for lor at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least lah
oh because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
mm I think I think in this case ah I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental lah but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya gemod lah gemod is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know uh his side ah
hundred fifty ya seh hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise lah it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate lah that is another alternative ah other alternative then your side then ah then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech oh wah like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
uh bottom line you both must tel
err got two choice if want to combine the
then err you and hairin you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his uh no need then you leh you just you just invite lah whoever that is important between your lis
err then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think um at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all lah ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually um pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push ah you no need to type ah you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes ah food ah food dishe
you will you will see like ah how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
uh tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of eh um
uh what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place lah then after that uh if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
uh then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
ah so then from there oh then you all like oh okay lah then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
ah so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline lah so that even though you got five months uh to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say khatib uh when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like uh the cabinet or whatever because I believe uh you got to check that one lah renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask err K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this lah there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that ah so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it lah that is one part of it ya so ya lah so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care kan
my only thing is that okay if he's uh you all have to like let's say workout lah the thing lah workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it uh on i
oh I think uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years lah or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking err is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay kan then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that ah
uh take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming lah so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but err we have to burden one of the side lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat lah kan
okay so err if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then uh so you spend lavishly ah your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion uh of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
oh ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide lah
ah what they want lah ah because I thin
err mix up what is it like like you think that oh what I want to have oh I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it lah
in other in one I read about in err on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift ah how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow lah no need lah I pay now loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
ah but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the oh your partner ah really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either um
like I said lah is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
uh get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like err like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya lah she wants the opinio
ah there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like err the person uh then where the family said firmly talk oh it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that uh kind of situations o
err kills the that particular portion lah but in this younger generation in your generation err things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get flat eh they must buy a condo or private propert
ah high ceiling income but then err there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know ah and then they finally got it ah then but there's a word then the reaso
err a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple lah ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no lah to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already ah
like very stress then me leh then ho
uh you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception um but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and ah both ways lah both parties lah so uh people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
ah then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then um you can't convince your parents lik

mm okay oh okay okay
ya okay

but that will be strange
mm
peranakan day ah so I think ya I have to go there early
mm
okay so that part
ya I have to ask dewi to do research lah then from there
ya lah and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding mah
okay
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
mm
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause err lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
mm okay
ya
whether to see okay
mm we can go up and see ah
mm
really ah you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel oh we thought of booking hotel for you all so

okay

is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
oh then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again ah
then everything finished at twelve thirty
eh wait ah
I remember is a eleven to three ah ya
okay
ah I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
err
that is the main main core concept
oh I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
she don't care
yes
ah that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about err one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty ah then whole lunch ah then in between before the one thirty starts right err we have the walk in lah then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans lah some activity lah so for about ya
katong and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
ah
okay

then come back ah
got a lot of things to do kan
within say three days you are in one country ah wah you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast kan
uh no distraction but also kan
you know then you want to look for somebody you call their hotel number kan and then you must remember which room they are in kan
now ah I cannot imagine ah
how you all last time ah work without all these ah
you know then when the first of the
uh when internet came along and then you are supposed to uh surf and
do some research kan then you must call up

now they are smart they know what to to target
of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
then you know lah I'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
ah good for you ah
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you kan
but I don't understand ah this parents kan
ah there must be other horror stories you see kan
ah
ah
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me lah eh you know is quite disturbing lah no you go and see especially pre COVID when families can go out kan then you see eh father mother two kids maybe ah maybe got maid lah eh doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like eh
right so what
said oh basically you can't be bothered lah you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
kan despite the fact that you had two fights that day
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay lah nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
mm mm ya
mm
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something I always remind
afternoon I check in what
but I will just check in okay everything okay you know came back K do homework or not are you know check check check right then when you come home is the same lah you know A you know tomorrow got what ah got not you know got this now whatever
it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say lah you know you cannot okay for two hours I cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no lah nothing to do with that
nothing
right cause I was an adjunct I was an adjunct lecturer then I saw the kind of err students that we have these days
even the good ones honestly ah
when you
err by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning ah is the maid
that is their their parental figure
you are looking at the laptop kan and what not ya and although parents now K lah belatedly realised hey you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
I saw so many
mm
mm mm
bit longer than that lah
ya mm
ah
ah
maybe there are other common interests but definitely traveling is one of them lah ah
ah
wah
wah
london and capitals
nowadays lah rarely snow and it when it snow it's not that kind of mountain type snow it's more what I call slushy
ah dirty
it's just that too much sugar no and then
very quickly your shoes eh specially we like to wear sneakers when we on holiday kan walking around
very fast very quickly your
shoes eh become very wet and then cold
mm
how long were you all there
mm mm
mm
uh madame tussauds
uh hogwarts ah
Disneyland ah eh
mm
the mannequin piece
correct ah ah
can see from your profile ah picture your picture profile
eh
ah
ah ah
ah ah recent photo
mm
mm
mm
ah
ah
ah
okay
ah
ah
wah
wah
ah
ah
alamak
wah
double or nothing
ah
wah
oh
wah
ya ah
ah ah ah ah
ah
ah
that's what they want to film ah you know
ah correct
wah
ya lah you and plus one then you just pay for the kids ah
wah wah
wah
ah ah ah
stadium lah
oh
training ground
ah
ah
it happened ah
of course it's a chance of a lifetime kan
ah
ya lah eh but you got the shoe box what
mm
mm mm
wah
mm
ah too bad lah too bad ah
ya
good eh ah
uh cause I was
uh in university kan ah
ah ah ah ah I wasn't in london so you know
for my university uh it's already you know out of london so I just go up to manchester lah if I go to london I have to go down to london
to them one of I mean you all look the same you know you know all this uh uh ya
English people so I'll just borrow someone's uh membership
card
and then watch the weekend game or something lah you know and my time don't forget because this is uh nineteen ninety eh
there's no man U wasn't big name
you know
ya it was like you know man city you know um
liverpool everton newcastle um all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian ah kan you know they track track kan
secondly thirdly kan
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
so that was uh always a lot of fun lah you know when I was also a student ah
then fast forward when you mention paris kan I actually uh live there two thousand four two thousand eight
not the duty free but the premium outlet
ah because that one is one stop
oh
euro Disney you see
ah
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet lah
ah dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
mm
mm mm
mm I live err I lived in err
err the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
err
quarter lah they call it ah so I'm literally halfway between champs elysees the arc of triomphe to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night kan
circling circling
so I lived in the really the central part ah
oh so easy for me pasal I just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite uh good
mm ah that's the gare du nord mm mm mm
the museum ah ah
ah
ah
ya lah mm the maghreb areas lah mm morocco algeria you know those kind of places
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
they they call it bateaux mouches the flyboat
ah ah
burn down ah
so you saw when it was still
oh
no it's actually eh really really
ah
ah sebab itu lah
wow you know it's really inspiring you see
ya
mm
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris ah look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
ah then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place lah you know so it's quite good to go
ah
mm
relax relax you know so quite fun lah
you know uh
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen ah I suspect will probably
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know lah
ah
paradigm paradigm mm
uh paradigm about two years about two years ah
mm
ya ya ah
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this lah pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks kan so
ah even for your maid you know today anyway lah eh these days
ah
but generally lah my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
that that's more it lah you know
err not not easy lah to go in kan that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
see the developments but the changes kan since my time there and it's been what you know uh more than twenty years kan almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
ah ah okay good we are one hour already
ah we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now

okay so the topics that we will be talking today ah it's um firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
for me ah I like science lah so maybe ten years in the future kan I would want to have
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and ah whatever there is lah so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also uh ten years time probably um I would like to
uh I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
focus on my uh
my computing whatsoever lah
yes
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe uh so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so mm
uh you were in your future house
and then um maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
mm
mind is stimulated ah
uh more to like action thriller
uh okay for for me uh I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you uh in-hand situations about uh about issues that could surface in the future lah uh technology areas or
something to think about
ya and and make you like oh it helps me to
solve problems easily and uh see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode eh
the reason why she was trapped is because um
uh her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting lah how they plan to uh get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then ah sometimes he can ah turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked lah cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end uh some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so uh he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and uh there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape lah so it was quite surprising interesting ah how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that eh hmm
if you can become an actor
uh what
hmm if you can become an actor eh and like any actor eh do you prefer uh do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
mm
I think I will
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is ah not getting cheaper these days
so I think uh focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases ah correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
I think
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be um how can mental health be um what's that addressed
and how can be um
how can we uh better improve our mental health area general
uh projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
very rigorous very very broad and very
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
uh rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given ah should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity ah
uh off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system ah like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
um
um how many one point two grams of uh phosphorus is needed to make uh I don't know cyanide or something
you can think of how to uh not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
okay so uh moving on maybe let's talk about
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever ah where would you want to go
and why
ya
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
oh when you were a little child
work studies stress ah
we play
mm
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
uh memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
um shape you and how you are today
ah
probably mm
I I think I would want to go to
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby uh in the european universe or the western part of the world
ah there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but uh there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
um ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and ah people were killed and people were died from um
um unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
uh the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know sina ah al jazali
uh mariam
abu sayde or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam lah I think it's very interesting to see
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
you ah
so apart from like
mm going back in time
um what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to uh have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to um to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal lah you particularly the elderly man take
the third one
ah
uh I think first lah I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
uh I wish
uh I wish that uh world hunger can be stopped lah cause
and they went in first world country
uh no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from uh camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad lah so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope ah nobody would go hungry lah in this world
and ah the second wish would be ah
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause uh we don't have the technology
because even from um the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
eh three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so um I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out um others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish uh actually uh I think I
I wish to have my own family one day inshallah
maybe next five ten years or so
really helps me to
uh have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me lah I really like to learn
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but um just hope to you know
um get married one day
okay so mm
so maybe uh cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
I eat right
I think uh I think
is not really essential lah but apparently
uh you want your friend or anything
how can I contribute better to the society
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
uh if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be uh be taught to the world
but um having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life lah
yup
respect
won't look down on you lah
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's um
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you lah that uh having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
flash
speed ah speed
inshallah
uh huh
I I like to teleport ah
ya
mmhmm
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
mmhmm
you know is is very easily easy lah I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like oh ah when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like um we have uh we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry um some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to um playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind lah that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
err is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation lah
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think uh uh this thing
trait between and humans probably uh they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have um
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
uh some uh some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
uh for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something lah something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
um especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be um probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
uh like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it lah
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting ah to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from um human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many um so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
very interesting
uh huh

it's a small group lah not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then um the place also okay lah not so busy last time used to be very busy but now um because of the COVID thing so companies send their
ah their staff
a participant they only allocate uh fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like err two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
oh I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the err
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is um they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges lah
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
um the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge ah one que
and one and then myself doing um
but surprisingly all the participant came for
ah
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
mmhmm
ah she ah panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause uh every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and um
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different lah this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid lah I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister lah but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really lah
timid is different from people who is fierce shah timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that uh these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but err she turned to me and tell me of like um
mm mm
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you um
cute lah but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no um
uh huh
uh huh
you didn't
mm
mm ya
mm
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
mm
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much ah maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
um
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
oo
uh sooner or later she she will forgot how to err right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the uh leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad lah mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
um
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
um
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put err into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got um cousin lah she could say ah eight boys ah the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be err medical attention given to her ah anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then err third she got um caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver mm they have
err nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know um half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday err maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so lah because she's already bedridden
um don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this um
that's that's what my opinion is lah
ya I know
mm
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this err dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya lah I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
oh eh you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation lah
err
mmhmm
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our money ah nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem lah people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right err your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card err see see and then err this this lady said hey you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is err err giving some uh help fund because I really apply then is it oh you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true mm how to accommodate right
um
um
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious lah I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite um err
complex lah I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
um I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
um I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at err until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't uh take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that uh you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
ah sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
ah contribute no that's what I think lah
I I mean right now this is
uh right now right now right now at this situation that I um
at present ah most of my err friends
mm
oh you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
um ya
um how you want to err how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that oh it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
um
um ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really ah really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand lah
um that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
ah
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say lah don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability lah
the
um mm um
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have err your energy level is our only that point of time eh is that much
and then you have feeling ah that ah you are human that you know that uh sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
err emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
mm
forever ya forever you be
ya
um ya true true
ya true
mm ya
breakdown
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
um um
somehow you were saying that family knows best lah
okay err family know best in terms of tackling one err let's say the mother lah because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming err since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
trial and error also
um ya true
um
so because chicken
oh complain and complain
mm oo mm mm
oo
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
um
mm ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do uh a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global err
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows
ya correct ya true okay that's about all thank you

one
oh nevermind lah
oh no lah I was just looking at the jurassic mile
um
I think track in changi airport
today or some some some time maybe I I dah
err is it sedap mania or something quite cheap right if I'm not wrong
err
have have they got those suggest sliced beef
ya
a'ah
ya
so
ya
hafizah
most likely ah
oh he he came back he had something on is it just now
oh
so um
oh ya we can do that also oh
but lucky got sinopec lah
anyway
dining in the garden ang mo kio ah
okay
oh
oh
okay lah
oh
oh jinjja eh
jewel
a'ah
changi village then after that
jinjja chicken like like I think it was like a few months back
then ah the queue was like really very long at jewel that time jinjja chicken lah I don't know why was it so long also I think I went there on
twelve chicken pieces for twelve dollars how big is the
how big is it
ya
wah cheap eh
a'ah seh

ya ya ya
satay soup base
huh really
oh
oh
oh
oh
err
so
so far
in the future
so
uh
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits lah
so what do you think how about you
huh serious
ya lah ya lah
ah
alcohol
things that
are not allowed lah in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead lah with it
segregate your assets lah so I think one good err platform to that we can use is
I as far as I know this is the
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
uh
um and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
uh forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
oh okay so like
err ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge lah then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside lah of of using
wahed invest
um
how to say eh
what err things you have to face lah if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up lah with this all these service charge lah when these banks
new way
true
do it the halal way then it's the best lah
ah correct
a'ah deep
ya correct lah I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
okay lah ya
jalan kayu ah
I okay
ya correct
oh
ya that's why
I mean good lah good I mean next time next time we go we should try lah

two so according to ministry of health uh we cannot have face to face interaction with um
the patients lah the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
so ya lah that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was um they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
ugh so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good um
so I mean there are different things that we
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined um
uh how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
you think so
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
oh that's very soon
ah so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff um and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families um with their expenses
next year lah next year when we can
so
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
um they bring in
ya
so
mm
mm mm
mm
okay okay okay now I understand
ah
mm
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
mm
mm ya okay
mm
ah
ah ya ya ya ya
oh okay
for the adoption drive
okay okay okay ya
ya
okay ya
okay
okay
mm

like for everything
mm
has a clinic
okay
mm mm
mm
so only only donations from from people from the public
wow
ah okay ya
mm
like uh
property development uh
mm
mm mm
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
that they know
all these uh animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
mm
where are the pythons
no I don't know
mm
ya ya
no it's your skin
uh the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
hello this is art ah by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a um a a young and
really up and coming artist and
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
the lorries ya so there's
huh
uh
ah
oh okay
mm
mm okay
mm
mm
oh
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
oh I didn't know that
oh
who puts up these these signs
oh say
mm
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore uh even
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while um ya
it's just the regular birds the minahs the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
yes
mm mm
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens kan not like before
hmm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
like different kinds of otters
okay
what is that what fan club
this is this sounds too
they're so cute they really are very cute
the ones that went to serangoon road
uh ya
okay
mm
sausage sausage
mm
I didn't know about that
is do they like
ah okay
how do they
serangoon
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
oh okay
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
mm
snakes of course
um we had our chickens and
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
mm mm mm mm
okay that's new to me
mm mm
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves kan
ah
mm
mm
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
mm
ah
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something

eh good man a lot things seh like ah
differently mm
mm
yes and your perspective of things also change
the last time was like what is this now like wah
you become wah excites you you know

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing lah and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
anything lah ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
uh huh
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
mm actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
mmhmm
ya
mm
okay
mm
okay then
so
if
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
okay right
yio chu kang all the way
okay
how much are you paying
mmhmm
hundred and seventy seven
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
oh
ya
mm
okay
there's active what
ya
ya
no not pilates lah aerobics
no not aerobics cardio
because
twelve classes
ya group class so uh ya lah so had three class and then because of COVID
ya
okay
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya lah just go for the active one is cheaper lah
ya
mm
mm
ya
I think
ya
I think there is should
but jalan besar maybe
ya have you gone for any active you never gone for you have never gone for an active classes
mmhmm
oh the one at jalan besar swimming pool
uh huh
okay
also very far
mmhmm
mmhmm

so you are improving lah
then are you still going for classes now
mmhmm
okay
okay okay
mmhmm
okay then
err
hmm
what
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm
so
mandi rice mm
yesterday
come you you try to smoke it but
I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything
ya and that's what I said what the smokiness
ya the smokiness was only on the skin
uh
ya
uh ya lah
mm
okay lah I mean
it's a normal
I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right
ya
mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer
when you make simple ghee rice
with like chicken curry and papadum
is either a hit or miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work
ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh
the biggest one
it's very filling
ya
mm
okay
then tomorrow what are you making
reheat the mandi rice
with ghee rice
okay you should teach you should teach me uh how to make ghee rice

mmhmm
ya

mm
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring um rice we can bring prep rice cooker
uh huh
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can uh I think you just bring to the room and
ya
or stew
ya no lah it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more what
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back what
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say what monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months what it's just one semester six months
oh eh not six months lah three months of school
so
no school uh just come back uh three months later
ya
she's working in what
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
mm so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies lah
so ya she already graduated what she she no no and then
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working lah and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that lah to make money
ya
ya kan just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland ah
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature what
it's more it's less
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries what
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
uh but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
uh huh
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you eh school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
no I don't want go ah
we don't have relatives there
I don't know I think it's something related to

okay I'm in
ya
ya
ya ya
how many people
wow
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
mmhmm
I think
they are
ya
ya
ya it's not basically is minuscule
I don't know
that's good man
that's good
ya I think so
so what next week starts ah
no
mm
ya ya ya ya
uh your skills your skill set and your experience kan
ya
the phase three ya
should be end jan
ah
you mean this this christmas coming now
okay
ya uh
okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya
mm
mm
would you be able to do that
ya
different things to do ah
ya
too tired
eh
feed her feed her
mm
mm
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
kan
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
err and then
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
ya no lah fosterer no
what
ya uh yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic ah they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say oh the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say eh your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay lor
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the uh but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
government
ah G O V
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish lah cannot be
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way lah you know ah in fact I was just talking about it to uh to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing kan
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean kan it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish lah what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
no they don't both okay
I mean this this this look at
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in pasir ris why because pasir ris you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no pasir ris farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to tengah now they are all in tengah now the animal welfare groups so they are developing pasir ris that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible uh to all residents who are going to panic
ah
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
oh wow
ah
oh they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is um is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again uh so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute kan
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya aww
is it oh so sweet
ya
aww bless her aww ya
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment lah
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you kena fine lah or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
uh okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home kan
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear lah some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough lah you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering lah I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering lah
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it uh we we tell people to be responsible feeders
they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no lah maybe not here lah but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
which is good lah to remind people you know kind of like that kan
ah
oh my goodness
they are copy cats
ya lah that's called district cats lah they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
mm
ya
ah
ah ya
eh
mm
because so much traffic eh
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm ya
but it's quite safe what this this tree
traffic
uh ya
ah
okay
ya
ah
ya
back to their refuge lah
people who work there know where these fellas go uh their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way oh then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
uh so funny and it's true right they would go almost every uh almost everyday
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where ah the drains ah does it go to I don't know uh so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but uh it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
uh so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules uh I guess you know the the otter felt safe lah
oh
you know there are a few families ah apparently
otter
there is a fan club ah
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
so they have the okay only the otter fan club lah
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know oh this is the kallang clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
this is their territory oh then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not kallang so that is the one so they have different families lah all clans
maybe another clan huh
ah ah so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
I don't think they look for other clans
um when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say kallang clan is like is like this is their territory
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks ah this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
I guess among themselves lah I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook aiyo so sad ah I think that was one was near uh
uh one of the um
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news lah okay so what I remember in the news
um
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove um they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far um the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts lah
one of their hangouts you know ah
ya ya ya
wah the otters right
cute right
ya uh
eh cute
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
ya
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no uh unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like uh in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say oh this the the the kallang clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like wow bloody hell how do they know I guess they know lah they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
you know not the caretaking type lah but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the ulars maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay lah let's put it this way lah shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction tau
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no lah they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
ah then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release lah
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again

so hello I'm I'm went from the toilet ah sorry ah for the wait
so like
ya what what were you doing ah meanwhile
ya ya ya ya oh ya it's sedap mania oh cheap ah really got what flavors over there I feel like going there again tonight leh
oh
bestnya
oh ya adam I think most likely ah
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
ya
ya so
oh oh
oh ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive lah
thailand
um ya so
I see I see
ah ya
ah
ya
adam needs more convincing to do lah
ya
err anyway
K
hmm
oh ya hor eh but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says err um
have you heard of ah what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there lor check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces wah shiok sia
actually we can two person share one what one person six piece six dollars okay sia right
ya so
satay sauce soup base I was like wah that's kind of cool then maybe we can
mm mm
oh
me ya
I I also don't know lah I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares tau so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya um
um
mm
I see I see
but how much ah the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
mm
ya ya
new um way
so
so
right kan
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity lah because like you know um
eh not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward lah for
that's why I think err
ya possibly because um even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
um maybe there's one thing we can consider lah
so ya
ya so
ya
so um
mm
okay um
I okay
I will try my very best to convince him to go
ya
there also the vibes like very nice you know
mee sua
ya I mean
ya worst come to worst me you adam
ya
ya
ya but the cheapest is two dollar per fifteen minutes
ya
ya
okay um
ya so
ah ya lah
um
so um
okay so we can review about I don't know
business ideas
huh
ya
ya
I don't know lah
oh oh your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
oh okay okay
oh
oh
oh
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine ah
I I'm wondering uh honestly curious
oh interesting eh psychology
wah
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify kan
ya so maybe lah it's the it's the same person lah loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
oh mother's gossip
uh maybe we should help lah we should help please tell
so um it's important lah to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized lah in
ah ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday lah
ah sentosa is it
that's how ah we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
so um sentosa maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar ah
you know we can just hang around at sentosa sentosa I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts lor
ah yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort serapong can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say lah they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
oh ya ya how much is it ah
I'm not too sure I really don't
oh ya we can do that also uh I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
err um can lah I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
ya as in eh as in the the timing also lah
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
can also lah because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
err let me see eh err
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
I I don't quite understand
so many rides lah but I think it'll be different
madame tussauds
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
twenty err twenty token
okay um
hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
there is uh another one ah gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
ya I think it's okay ten token worth it one hour seh one hour we can it's a very long time lah not bad seh
ya don't have their have eco adventure but I don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and sentosa and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
ya lah we can oh got mega adventure park um
ya so we ten ten so we get to take err two different attractions lah which I think a bit quite nice eh some more plus cable car then after that
ya eh what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
aiya I guess not too sure but okay lah we can check there out we can check that out some more I mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so I mean we we can see lah what else we want but I think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then I think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in sentosa just by the segway
ya so okay lah so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
err
it is the nearest station is tiong baru
and I am like wow not bad not bad not bad interesting
oh eleven to fifteen december
so ya segway so we segway for one hour
basic ah seh
ya original price eighty nine dollars
or one mega jump then
err actually we can do the also lah the is ten token
you know it's not bad ah usual price twenty two dollars
eh actually this one better if you want we should go for the sea aquarium tour ten token then the other ten we go mega bounce lor
ya more better than one hour jer
yup yup
ya bike got a lot of things lah then maybe you know sit somewhere carry marrybrown if you wanna
or marrybrown or or or we can just go ce la vi eat aspirasi mah

um and so far it's been well um it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring lah
um it's among the home-based sellers lah
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
have their
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
ah ah
customers ah
yes
delivery is
um by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya ah so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight lah hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
um
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
ah I have school I have um freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
ya
go ah because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change lah because I like to bake also
um brownies or cookies something like that
branding
tahbegs tahbegs
ya it's tahbegs is from tahu and begedil but we make it very hipster
so it's tahbegs
ya T H B E G S
oh ya um I also own a small business selling bawals
eh it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be eh next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
um better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
ah because um me and my partner lah
ya we we
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
twenty one
that young
oh
ah
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
that's the best you can sleep
oh okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
oh mm ah
mm mm
wow okay
uh uh
mm mm
I you like wrapped
oh okay okay okay
uh uh
uh uh
oh my god
they didn't pay you
oh ya ya ya
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh I see
um
what am I doing at nineteen
um I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
um
there was this
and then um I was very camera shy last time
so I'm like meh like I I don't even bother lah but then my partner saw like eh you should try lah you just try then orh
I said no I don't want err I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the um the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
ah he applied to two ah company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
ah it was an unpaid job
for
um until I was maybe
um nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
um
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like um the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
err when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me lah like oh you need to start
um charging these people because you are having a lot of um
and alhamdulillah it also went well
ah
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
um sell their products ah
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
uh and it didn't work ah
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because ah her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales lah so I was like okay um actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they um they really spread the word and tag you know
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
other companies ya
mmhmm
usually um before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay lah the context ah the context of the post ah we
ya the description we always like um send it
ah on our post
uh it's our post because we are like um ya
usually is like that
ah no that that's the thing that's why I don't um I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like um they told me lah like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
um is very difficult
um and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle lah but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school um there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson um end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night lah something like that
ya it's like it's very bad lah is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up uh my own company ah
um
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
alamak we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
mm
because all of this um of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
um creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well lah and
uh uh
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face lah when I'm opening this um Kamash
um
yes
and
out first what ah ah
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
ah we manufacture ourself
ah no uh we liaise with a factory in jakarta
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
mm
no lah I mean like obviously uh when you grow up
eh
ah my god okay it needs to switch
naturally um
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then ah
some personal reasons lah for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
those type of
incident
car crash eh plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee what
and
ya lah exactly then I was like okay sure
so ah basically ah
so I'm like okay lah since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
um ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor orh an acting
orh okay ah clown doctor
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
oh okay
uh
I can fix my own teeth
mm
mm
wow
ya
oh my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
mmhmm
mm
mm I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
eh the first ya your first show is it
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like wah
well quite nice lor
so
ya
but it was good though
mm
oh I see
oh
mmhmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mm
ya that's that's the thing
um usually people are afraid to set a price
um
we calculate our expenses ah and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see lah um like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like oh we can sell it from this price to this price no uh no lower than that
if it's lower than that um means
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
mm mm
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not chai I don't like chai
oh really
oh I see
ah ah
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
oh my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
oh okay you thinking far
yes
uh huh
oh okay okay okay
I don't know ah I feel like
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
oh ya

wow such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in what and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
and then like I was training at
and then
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's um
so ya
um how to say ah
they hold their respect lah towards their opponent
like are ready to like ah I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman

ya
mm
hmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
but to them I say oh okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
