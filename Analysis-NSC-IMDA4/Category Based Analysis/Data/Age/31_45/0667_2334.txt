okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
<malay>siapa</malay> [lah]
[oh] was it with his girlfriend also
serious [oh] is it because of his surprise birthday party (uh)
so what have you decided
[eh] how do you get her number [ah] I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
!wah! your friend is so going to feel betrayed [sia]
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
where there's me then <malay>baru ada</malay>
so [dah] decide
(hmm) [dah] <malay>macam</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay> project
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
(hmm) <malay>tak suka</malay>
[orh]
but you think he okay or not
serious [ah]
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I <malay>suka</malay> especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza [lah]
(mm)
tourist stuff <malay>dekat</malay> #Sentosa#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever [lah]
wait but you [dah] <malay>beli belum dia punya</malay> ticket
<malay>cari</malay> online [ah] I think <malay>ada yang ada</malay> twenty five per cent off [eh]
[oh]
okay
[oh] forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
[oh] that's good deal man
[eh] can you share the link with me
it's not so much the beach [lah] because you all are going to <malay>macam tempat tempat</malay> the attraction right
(mm)
that's at Marina Bay <malay>punya tempat</malay>
you know the one <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> Marina Barrage <malay>itu hari</malay> [oh] because you took #Jihan# <malay>punya</malay> car (um)
before you <malay>sampai</malay> Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
<malay>ada</malay> air-con <malay>tak</malay>
!alah!
!alah! are you going <malay>malam</malay> or <malay>pagi</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
[oh] and fly kite
[oh]
can you please buy a good kite
[oh] ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right <malay>tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> your own is
[oh] <malay>tak de</malay> tentage [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau nak</malay> tentage you can take mine
I don't know
[oh] but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
[orh] ya [lah] I mean is at one corner [lah] if that's what you want <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak orang tak kacau</malay> then okay [lah]
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter [lah] that had shade
ours was quite open <malay>dia</malay> exposed [ah] so
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
(uh) given the circumstances I think that's not bad [lah] but I think I saw some of them <malay>duduk dekat</malay> nearer to the lift area that one <malay>tak kena panas sangat</malay>
what time you intend to go [ah] that's the point
(mm)
actually that day
<malay>kalau bawa</malay>
(mm)
but <malay>pernah tak</malay>
ya <malay>kalau tak pernah</malay> then better don't
#Seah Im# <malay>kat luar</malay> [lah] park <malay>kat luar</malay>
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him <malay>jangan bawa</malay> <malay>motosikal</malay> because if he doesn't bring his bike then <malay>dia rasa macam</malay>
<malay>asal</malay> [eh] normally we ya
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know !fuh!
but <malay>muka</malay> girlfriend <malay>dia muka</malay> poker face <malay>tak</malay> is it she can [ah]
okay actually to me [lah] is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like #Razi# did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places [ah] then what happen [ah]
[oh] he will [ah] okay okay (um) because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
[oh] okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
following each other's plan can but <malay>kalau</malay> the partner like me like that last minute say don't want [ah] I want today I got I got cramp [ah] I decide not to go to #Sentosa# then <malay>habis</malay>
gone
but ya that's very nice [lah] of the girlfriend
(mm)
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
because marina barrage <malay>dia punya</malay> <malay>jauh</malay> [tau]
Marina Bay (uh) Marina Marina Bay [lah] [kan]
Barrage if you got no car you go #Sentosa#
because because #Sentosa# <malay>tak ada kereta senang</malay> that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
[oh] because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay [lah]
[oh] okay then Marina Barrage makes sense [lah]
yes yes yes
(mm)
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have #meriahness# if there is
I mean !aiya! for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
I seriously think that's a good idea too because #Sentosa# <malay>nak keluar pun leceh</malay>
ya ya actually it's true [lah] I I mean no I personally don't like #Sentosa#
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for #Sentosa#
<malay>apa</malay>
earlier [lah]
[oh] it's a weekend [ah]
[ah]
okay
[oh] ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
[orh]
cable car then <malay>yang</malay> Carlsberg <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>yang pusing pusing</malay> the thing that <malay>pusing</malay>
then <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>yang lima</malay>
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before [lah] in Singapore
I went I don't think I've been to the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> Singapore
Hong Kong I went to #Bangkok# <malay>tak salah</malay> [eh] with my husband once
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
[ah] okay
but ya you share with me [ah] I also want to see [eh] since my staycation [dah] <malay>kena</malay> cancel [kan] so
[ah]
ya then you make him <malay>jalan</malay> also
but I'm pretty sure <malay>dia penat</malay> from going for <malay>kelas mengaji</malay> okay that's wrong but
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
<malay>dia kat mana dia dekat</malay> <malay> bukan #Tampines#
the birthday boy is gonna be from
#Tampines#
not the other side of the Singapore right
[ah]
because <malay>kalau daripada</malay> #Tampines# actually it's a bit more difficult [lah] <malay>dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang</malay> [kan]
[ah] okay
I see [oh] it's not like she go and <malay>jumpa</malay> him somewhere and then they
wait where she stay again
near my house
[ah] near my friend's place okay okay okay
yeah <malay>ni macam</malay> papa [lah]
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
[oh] my god
anyway motor is convenient [ah]
but I think
[oh] really
so early [ah] it's indoor [what]
[oh] last entry <malay>dia bukan tutup</malay> last entry
<malay>bukan tutup</malay> so that means (uh) last
last entrance normally <malay>tutup</malay> one hour later [ah]
[oh] you (mm) okay [lah] I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay [lah]
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
(uh) I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow [lah] !huh!
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because <malay>susah</malay> you really have to <malay>macam tak de</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> secrets out
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people [lah] so I always leave it to other people
[oh] ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like [ah]
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better [ah]
food
<malay>berapa orang</malay> [sia]
for eleven that's <malay>mahal</malay> [leh]
okay all growing boys
ya but to me (mm) okay [lah] for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
[oh] okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
(mm) then what she say
[oh] my god
(uh) then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
(uh) #mee# tom yum (mm) one of them
(um) <malay>nasi goreng</malay> tom yum
<malay>kat mana</malay>
you have to see you know whether you have to make [oh] but because it's a hawker centre <malay>tak yah buat</malay> reservation [ah]
no because now
[ah]
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
<malay>habis</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>kalau</malay>
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
<malay>korang bawa makanan tak gi sana</malay>
potluck [ah] <malay>macam</malay> picnic style [ah]
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason [lah] [eh] let's say
ya if satay by the bay let's say <malay>penuh nak</malay> #mams# [kan] then you find in that area <malay>apa lagi kedai makan [ah]</malay>
(um)
<malay>cuma</malay> now we are not at #Sentosa# if you at #Sentosa# then <malay>ada banyak</malay> options [ah]
yes
<malay>dekat</malay> Vivo <malay>banyak apa makanan</malay>
no [oh] my god <malay>dorang ni</malay>
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time [what]
<malay>nasib</malay> #Zaki# <malay>beli berapa banyak</malay> water bottle <malay>dia beli</malay> I think about
<malay>enam tujuh ada</malay> mineral water
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme [ah]
because now the weather like <malay>sekejap panas sekejap sejuk</malay>
<malay>sekejap panas</malay> then the next thing <malay>hujan</malay>
[oh] it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
[oh] <malay>dia kulit tebal</malay> [lah]
for what
are you serious
ya [lah]
so that you can focus on your work [ah]
<malay>korang tiga orang aje</malay> [eh]
you don't have any other friends [meh]

<malay>penyanyi tu siapa</malay>
#Shad# <malay>sama sama</malay> group [kan]
[oh] you got further subset of your
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah <malay>dia macam</malay> one committee and then within the committee <malay>ada macam</malay> sub sub group [ah]
(mm)
I know I know you know I know I know already [lah]
[a'ah]
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap [ah]
ya [lah]
[orh]

and the same person I don't like too okay
!wah! I should make friends with this friend of yours [lah]
I can so <malay>dengan dia</malay>

ya ya ya ya ya ya I can see the long hair guy right <malay>dia punya muka macam</malay>
if I don't like you [ah] it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay [lah] no loss to him

[oh] confirm [ah]
it's confirmed
(mm)

!alamak!
(uh huh)
yeah you told me that
ya ya ya you told me also [lah] it hit on the wrong timing you say if it's next month maybe <malay>boleh</malay> consider [lah]
(mm)
now
it's okay
it's okay
[orh]
[orh]
you told me right is that the one
right the indian muslim one and the that one right ya
then <malay>kau sorang</malay> serious [ah]
okay [lah]
(hmm) (hmm)
I don't know I don't I don't miss in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
[oh] Marissa #Shu# you never go before [ah]
I think if you go with #Shu# also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
[oh]
ya [lah]
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say [ah]
[oh] but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant [lah] but okay [lah] I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
(mm)
but they make you feel included [lah]
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that #Shiqah# #Ad# #Razi# group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean #Aidil# they all but I rarely get to meet him [lah] but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends [sia] [oh] and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
[ah]
ya that one we got no other [eh] unless you want to bring the the <malay>bapa</malay> and the <malay>anak</malay> and the
but I think two person is much more better [leh] I feel [lah]
don't know [lah] I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
!aiya! but they going week weekend [ah]
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
that time [ah] I see my friend <malay>pergi</malay>
like (err) <malay>kosong</malay> the whole you know where the
the one that they always do (uh) free dance <malay>dia macam</malay> dance on the road <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> the road [ah]
that one <malay>dia pergi kosong</malay> [lah]
[oh] ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me <malay>dia orang kena buang kerja</malay>
I don't know how you can recognise such faces [seh]
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
[ah] no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary [ah]
try [ah]
cannot [ah]
don't know I don't know you pay me also <malay>belum tentu</malay> I <malay>naik</malay>
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
like you know the restaurant <malay>yang</malay> no the restaurant <malay>yang ada kereta kereta tu</malay> [lah] the vintage car
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
cannot cannot be I <malay>tak kerja</malay> right I think <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja kot</malay>
I went there share I went with who [ah] I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
was it was it <malay>berapa bulan</malay> [ah]
early part [eh]
[oh] I <malay>belum pakai tudung</malay> so that means yeah ya ya I <malay>belum pakai tudung</malay> so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
[oh] crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
first trimester is supposed to be like (uh) they say what <malay>belum melekat</malay> yet
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay [what]
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared [sia]
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
the flower one [dah] <malay>habis</malay>
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
<malay>rezeki</malay> don't <malay>tolak</malay>
yes
<malay>rezeki</malay> [dah] <malay>ketuk kat pintu</malay> knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
[orh] <malay>dia tak kaku dia tak</malay> awkward [lah]
how
wait <malay>dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah</malay>
what
[oh] my god okay
[oh]
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
[oh] so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
<malay>lurus bendul</malay> [lah] that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
opinion
not <malay>lurus bendul</malay> I think <malay>dia tak</malay> nonsense [ah]
(uh) <malay>lurus</malay>
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
and that's the reason why <malay>dia kena</malay> avoid <malay>orang orang yang macam</malay> hypocrite
because if he doesn't hide
[ah] he will say
a bit [meh]
a bit [meh] <malay>panas baran</malay>
no no this this is what that <malay>darah muda</malay>
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be #Aidil# [lah] up till now
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know [dah] <malay>besar anak mak</malay>
actually actually is true [eh]
once <malay>dia masuk</malay> primary school [ah]
and then his mum will be left
!aww!
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
[oh] I don't tell her so that (uh) she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who [ah]
[ah] I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
you bloom into a <malay>minah</malay> or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
path you wanna take [ah] I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
yeah I took a nerd path come on then <malay>balik lambat</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay <malay>balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan</malay>
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
<malay>bila</malay> [sia] the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I remember
I <malay>jumpa kat</malay> #Tampines# mart
you know the McDonald's <malay>punya</malay> carpark <malay>masuk</malay> right ya ya ya ya
#Kartini# will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come <malay>jalan</malay>
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then [ah] whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already [lah] this one
not like <malay>macam</malay> accident every day also like that that one not accident already
then (uh) I remember [lah] the one in my secondary school is this
(um) very strict indian discipline guy you know
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he <malay>sengaja</malay> he never
we were like
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he <malay>tutup</malay>
then we run to the main gate <malay>masuk</malay>
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
[oh] ya we we I tell you we are nerds [what] we can spend in library from nine [eh] nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
(um) was I like that for secondary school

I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater !huh!

debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level [ah]
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
(uh) <malay>apa dorang panggil</malay>
[ah]
[ah] because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
(uh) yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
[oh] sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
(uh) arts (uh) sports and
(uh) I don't know geek [lah] I would categorise (uh) debate as geek [lah] I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood [lah] it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek [lah] okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool [lah] debater [oh] I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I represented
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why [eh] I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game (um) minefield
so basically <malay>kat batu dorang buat macam</malay> it's something like chess [ah] <malay>dorang buat ni</malay> yeah
[eh] that one is I tell you [ah]
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject [lah]
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch [oh]
like how curious a a kid is [oh] why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the [oh] so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I [oh] the only reason why I went for that course was because [ah] [ah] ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
(uh) who (err) so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late (uh) we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up [lah] basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he didn't allow us to go in <malay>tutup</malay>
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
[ah]
[eh] come on [lah] I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
let's go <malay>cabut cabut</malay> come let's
<malay>cabut</malay> I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
the first guy said <malay>naik naik naik naik</malay> we went out
he [hor] we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say [eh] you know [ah]
actually the head prefect saw my face already [ah] just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl [ah]
<malay>maju</malay> [lah] she she's
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class [lah]
[eh] so and so so and so saw my face already know !wah! if he see that I disappear already [ah] sure he will mark me [one]
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school [lah] [sia]
(uh) ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time [lah] since [dah] <malay>kena</malay> marked also right we
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
I think second last day ya then we walk okay [ah] <malay>kena buat</malay> detention first time in my life [ah] <malay>kena</malay> detention know then I was like
!walao! [eh] this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention [lah]
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually (uh) supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself [lah]
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no [lah] of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
[oh]
[a'ah]
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
[oh] my god
[oh] but the discipline master doesn't know you personally [ah]
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so #pai kia# [ah]
all cannot make it [sia]
[ah]
!huh!
[eh] actually primary school classes are the worst to manage [ah]
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths [ah] okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health [lah] <malay>kesian budak ni</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila bila</malay>
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that [one] especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun [lah] they are innocent [ah] so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can [ah] if ya
