does turkey have beaches like this because it's right next to greece I'm assuming it has to
(mm)
ya so
turkey and greece are big and powerful cyprus is a bit of their little cousin now it's so small and turkey and greece are pulling it cause it has a lot of like is very famous for the farmland it has good natural resources (um) good location so like <malay>macam</malay> turkey greece <malay>macam</malay>

at first I thought like <malay>bedek</malay> [lah] <malay>ini macam</malay> global myth [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> then a lot of people was really cause there is no confirmation you you hear a lot of the story on the internet
I think segway is a very (err) lazy way like you can walk walk [ah] I mean unless you are like a a person who has difficulty with physical physical task if not just walk
no peacekeeper there these people the you can see
(err) cyprus [ah] the they are they are neighbours [what]

on weekdays a bit hard [lah]
(mmhmm)
#putri# [ah]
the son work from home
can <malay>semua boleh</malay> work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive [eh] and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's (err) very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them (uh) checklist (err) time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time [lah]
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
[ah] <malay>nampak lama sangat</malay>
what is your opinion on #aldemir#
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion [ah]
cause turkey turkey has always prided itself on being a a circular state like they are they are muslim majority but they are also like very very proud they are very proud of their progressiveness like (err) women don't need to wear the the <malay>tudung</malay> and ya [lah] I mean it's good but
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very (err) it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king #faisal# the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that [eh] <malay>dia ini macam macam mahu</malay> but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up
of what
what's on [oh] they watching or what
by who
the government
<malay>macam</malay> brotherhood [lah]
they're pragmatic [lah] ya ya
[oh] he got to K so he he got <malay>tahan</malay> because he take itself [lah] you that's the border the demarcation then you of course he gonna get in trouble they cross the thing you got the
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot [eh] honestly
ya obviously you gonna you gonna get
don't don't eff around man in in other people countries it's not right [lah] you
he's not gonna get in
