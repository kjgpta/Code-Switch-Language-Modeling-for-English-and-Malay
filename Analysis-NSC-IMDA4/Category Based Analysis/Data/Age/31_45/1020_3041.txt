(mmhmm) (hmm)
it's very interesting (um) norway
has the most luxurious [oh] my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage (um) milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know (um) apparently they spend one point two
a hundred and twenty thousand I think (um) to work on the prisoners like (um) norway <malay>punya</malay> government (um) <malay>dorang macam</malay> (um)
<malay>dorang macam betul-betul</malay> (um)
<malay>bekerja keras</malay> towards
<malay>apa dia macam</malay> [ah] believe in (um) changing people instead of punishment like being at prison itself it's already a punishment but (err) so they don't believe in like you know (err) behind bars and everything ya
(um) <malay>macam</malay>
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then (err) that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals (um) but (err)
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like (um) like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
(um) of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though (um) ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much [ah]
ya (mm) [kan] <malay>macam susah sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab orang singapura ni dorang macam banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam buat ni salah buat tu salah</malay> [ah] <malay>kasi banyak duit salah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak kasi duit salah apa dorang nak</malay> [ah]

(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya true
ya I actually binged watched that it's so interesting they only cover one asian country which is philippines philippines one is so bad it's so so bad do you know that like when you are captured like you are [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) somebody found like saw you at the the crime and they like bring you in I don't know what you call that they detain you
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
<malay>rabak gila aku macam aku macam</malay> woke you know <malay>macam</malay> shock so <malay>macam</malay> shock I'm so shook I'm so shook by the what like
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying (um)
(err) the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
it's just (ugh) I don't know it's just !wow! it's just mindblown if you want [oh] was it vulgar ya I was thinking like maybe you can share these things <malay>dekat</malay> students but you know maybe is to be too
vulgar ya maybe can (um) ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
(err) prisons that are <malay>macam</malay>
different
because like (err) norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same [ah] philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya

<malay>mahal gila aku macam ada orang nak beli</malay> and <malay>dia cakap bangsa-bangsa dia</malay> [ah] <malay>beli yang macam kita tak sangat</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>mahal</malay>
(um) <malay>paling murah aku tengok anting-anting dia jual ninety</malay>
[ah] <malay>sembilan puluh lapan dolar</malay>
[ah]

in her in her ya ya but [ah] <malay>aku ada jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kat macam</malay> this (err) <malay>kat</malay> creative markets [ah] they are selling quite cheap affordable but of course you have to like you know do the
do the mechanics for ourselves [ah] to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged (um) someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her [lah] then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing [ah] if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn [what]
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya (mm) it's stainless steel

(mmhmm)
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday [lah] ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with [lah]
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like (uh) if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
like I told him I mean I could just engage her now and then if next year it doesn't falls what she says like it will confirm because she she already confirm with the underwriting say like confirm confirm can can ya because she gave me the assurance so I mean I can just buy it and then like <malay>aku</malay> if doesn't then I will just terminate and just go to adam it's easy for me you know just like (um)
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment
ya so adam was supposed to
get back to me on that but he's not
no no no I
