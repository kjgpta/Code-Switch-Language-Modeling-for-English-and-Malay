(mm)
he don't know how to find job is it
!huh!
[oh]
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
(mm)
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment [eh] where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
!wah! I'll be great and that [sia] andre sure [sia] will be good at that
he always he always !huh!
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
!wah! snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
(mmhmm) I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
!huh!
<malay>buat lagi buat lagi macam mana kau tidur dalam lubang</malay>
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I also cannot like <malay>panas</malay> [sial] only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay [lah] he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay <malay>katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun</malay> [kan] but I cannot like the bed very comfortable [lah] then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I <malay>turun bawah</malay> already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast <malay>dah ada</malay>
he doesn't I mean he will cook [lah] once in a while but lately we've been buying (err) he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from [sia] he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed <malay>mandi</malay> take out his clothes and stuff and all that [lah] so
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
then he was okay he he still can <malay>layan</malay> okay ten thirty <malay>aku tak bangun kadang-kadang</malay> I will wake up early I'll wake up at eight but then [ah] because I wake up too early right then I tell myself okay [lah] my alarm ten thirty (uh) no my alarm at nine thirty so I can still sleep I still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep [lah] bloody hell then when I wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then I see my message he already
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him [lah] whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
[oh] so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick [ah] just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
ya see so so it's not that there is nothing to do it's because <malay>kau orang pemalas</malay>
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know [ah] it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like [oh] he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making [eh] like it's pointless like I told andre because (uh) last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle [lah] so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me [lah] but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices [what] anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be [sia] so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise [ah]
(mm)
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
#syed# better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar [what] and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself [lah] like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose [lah] but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve [sia]
I wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he <malay>makan</malay> lunch already he go back to office
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like [oh] (um)
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
(mm) same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there [lah]
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already [what] tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
with andre I'm thinking whether I should get him a <malay>batik</malay> shirt [ah] to match me but <malay>kedai mana ada jual sekarang</malay>
on a saturday
but it sure is
<malay>pukul berapa dia orang buka dia orang buka tak</malay> saturday
<malay>pukul berapa dia orang buka</malay> because if
upper #joo chiat#
arab street <malay>punya mahal</malay> #doh#
cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or #tangs# I think and then I was thinking okay by the time <malay>kita habis</malay> we will probably be eating dinner
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one [what] so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
and then we will go to town so I won't have time to go and bring him there then I was thinking <malay>kalau dia orang buka pagi</malay> then I can go and buy first
and then <malay>harap-harap</malay> [ah] <malay>dia boleh muat</malay>
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
because I don't think he got I don't think he got I don't think he got <malay>baju</malay> that will match that colour <malay>dia ada baju yang boleh</malay> match <malay>ni</malay>
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts [ah] but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see [ah] I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
he will eat [lah] he will eat he he he likes food in general babe <malay>dia tak</malay> picky when it comes to <malay>makan dia tak</malay> picky like even when you spicy like deepavali <malay>aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk</malay>
then he eat but it was really spicy for you [ah]
he eat but he's still white
so like white people [kan] standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
[oh] my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one [what] I mean if you are near the area then ya [lah] if not it'll be very troublesome for you [what]
!wow! I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope [ah] out of curiosity
when is #syed's# birthday
january what
[oh] my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini [lah] but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs [what] your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
do it do it do it <malay>babi</malay>
!wah!
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them [one] know in like the last message I got was that [ah] [oh] it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
(hmm)
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
!aiyo!
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out
ya I must like spare my <malay>baju-baju</malay> or what I mean I have some of like my my things there but I don't have my clothes there I have my workout stuff I have my my boxing gloves are there
my some of my underwear is there
like I already have a toothbrush there and he already bought a shampoo for me that's there so like that one all <malay>tak payah fikir</malay> [lah] but other than that he's bald what he want to wash
