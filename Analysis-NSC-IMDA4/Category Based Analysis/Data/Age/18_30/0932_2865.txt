ya
(mm)
is it I love wearing the mask [eh]
it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like [oh] hi welcome to <malay>apa apa apa</malay> you know then
do [ah] then after that then I will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask [what] then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah]
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
you don't want to <malay>tegur</malay> like that then you just like !alamak! <malay>dia ni lagi</malay> then
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them
ya ya
tegur
[oh] [oh] ya ya ya ya ya ya <malay>betul tak tak sombong</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti dia cakap sombong</malay> then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like

then I want to find another industry to work at
<malay>dah tua</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> tiring [ah] events
then also
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya still searching [lah] that's why I I end up
about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
my friend <malay>dia nak jadi</malay> temperature screener [kan] <malay>dekat kedai tu</malay> [kan]
then <malay>dia orang kata mesti ada</malay> diploma then I'm like
<malay>susah sangat ke</malay> temperature screener you know like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>tak</malay> makes sense [ah] I think <malay>dia orang macam sengaja nak</malay>
<malay>buat susah</malay> you know then they complain like you know [oh] nobody want to apply <malay>padahal</malay>
I don't know [ah] what's going on also

<malay>kerja apa</malay> (uh) teaching
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> but I got (um) <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] tuition experience and like you know
I do events so I can quote unquote handle classroom <malay>gitu</malay>
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you [lah] but ya
(mm) (mm) then
(mm)
(mm) ya usually they they like (um) and they like they prefer
registered people [ah] usually
but like
ya I
what
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax [ah]
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (uh)
ya then now also like <malay>nak</malay> classroom but then because you have to adhere to the COVID regulations then like <malay>macam</malay>
every hour <malay>kena</malay> sanitise <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] like (ugh)
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope [ah]
then <malay>macam malas gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but this one <malay>dia</malay> toxic [ah] the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the management [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ngada-ngada</malay> [ah] I don't know how to say
[ah]
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
then like the first three days the management <malay>tak datang</malay> so I'm like okay [ah] this job like not bad [ah] I quite enjoying myself like still not very
like <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] can manage [lah] you know not so
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
(um) <malay>tengok</malay> how I work [lah] you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then <malay>dia orang</malay>
like they just like mood totally go down [seh] I don't know [ah] then
ya she damn <malay>cari pasal</malay> [ah] like with me like <malay>semua benda yang</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> which I think is like
not even her problem <malay>dia macam tak</malay> okay

because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training [tau]
then she say to me like (um) what [ah]

then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
if I know everything why I training right like <malay>bodoh</malay> [pe] <malay>perempuan ni</malay>
ya
<malay>apa</malay>
ya ya
ya
she said twice [eh] in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting [what]
so (uh) she complain to the boss in chinese
(uh) then then I know what he what they she roughly mean [ah] I don't get like everything but I <malay>boleh faham sikit-sikit</malay> [ah]
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
<malay>aku baru</malay> then <malay>aku tak tahu apa-apa</malay> you know things like that then I'm like
fine whatever just
keep quiet [ah] then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
or is it the next day or something like that then she like <malay>tegur</malay> me [ah] she was like
then she was like okay I'm going to test you then I'm like [eh] <malay>kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa</malay> then <malay>kau orang nak</malay> test <malay>aku</malay>
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed [lah] because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing [lah] basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I (uh) obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do [lah] because
I know how to do [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I managed to pass the test [lah] then she was like okay actually (um) I think you can
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then
(uh) you don't know anything so I (uh) that time I'm just like <malay>malas</malay> [seh] <malay>nak datang balik</malay>
ya so that one gone [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>biar dia cari orang lain</malay>
you want <malay>kira</malay> work from home [ah] I don't want [seh]
(err)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] you mean [ah] are you like developers or
not really
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
!wah! that's interesting [ah] I was contemplating learning that
ya because (um)
upper course ya
that's cool [ah]
because I got media arts
(um) diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
but then now I I see like <malay>macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua</malay> I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay [lah] I guess
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
I don't know [eh]
my friends <malay>semua macam</malay> introvert <malay>dengan</malay> homebody <malay>juga</malay> so it was quite fun [lah] for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
you ask them to <malay>jumpa</malay> right like like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually I don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then I suffocated in a sense that
(um)
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
too wild too long in that's why I'm like <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like I'm the eldest [kan]
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
but then my parents <malay>dia orang macam nak</malay> my sis my younger sister to marry first
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] I think my relationship longer but my relationship (uh) I'm also attached to a non-muslim
so
ya it makes things more complicated [ah] I guess then my sister she <malay>macam</malay>
she attached <malay>dengan</malay> muslim guy so that's already one
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like F&B jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know [eh]
<malay>macam sekarang</malay> right I was thinking like is it
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
marriage is just like <malay>macam</malay>
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
[eh] but then you know what so scary [leh] like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) recently [kan] I <malay>baca kat</malay>
facebook [ah] now now got a lot of free time [what] so more time to browse facebook <malay>gitu semua</malay>
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
!wah! then [ah] so if cause to me right <malay>macam kalau kita</malay> relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
need lawyer need to sign things all <malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
(mm)
is it
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also I don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
I mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] I don't know whether
not like I got married before [lah] but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous [what]
<malay>apa</malay>
sorry what
(uh) <malay>tak</malay> I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know <malay>rajin-rajin</malay> in the kitchen then <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] (um) #izzati# finally can get married <malay>gitu</malay> you know but then I'm just like
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much <malay>kalau tahu</malay> I just
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun [lah] but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] I feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) I think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
<malay>apa ni</malay>
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
like #chiongster# also [lah] <malay>kerja banyak</malay> and things like that then my parents also not happy [ah] because like
supposedly twenty five <malay>kita kena dah</malay> married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off [lah]
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy [lah] then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay [lah] like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family [kan] but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] then what !huh!
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
<malay>kita pun ada cakap</malay> [ah] like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far I've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
then she say it's like hell [lah] because the mother in-law <malay>macam</malay>
like have a lot of expectations of her <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
(mm)
but sometimes <malay>kecoh</malay> is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of <malay>kecoh</malay>
ya ya
because like
I feel
[oh] okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she <malay>cakap dia tak nak</malay> [ah] she <malay>nak cari rumah sendiri juga</malay>
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
like you know <malay>hari raya</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> like <malay>rumah kat</malay> #jurong# then <malay>mesti ada kucing punya</malay> I don't know [ah] I don't know how to say ya
ya
I never say [ah] <malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> [eh]
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of #jurong#
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
[oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #pasir ris# then I [oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #changi# okay then <malay>pergi</malay> #jurong# [ah] I
!wah! that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
(mmhmm)
yes it's true
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya that's right
(mm)
(hmm) do you like that or not
okay
(mm)
[oh]
those are touch and run away kind ya
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [seh]
the what you do
<malay>apa</malay>
what the
[ah] ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
<malay>apa</malay>
watch group !wah! your parents also very ons [eh]
[ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm) interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
[oh] but recently my sister <malay>kena</malay> then I was like what the hell
ya but I don't think I can be like you [lah]
like the last three times (uh) people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
(uh)
more like like I think too well of myself
a bit overconfident [lah] <malay>dia orang kata</malay>
ya
so so it's like I'm like !oi! (uh) why you follow me like you know <malay>padahal</malay> I'm just a
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it [ah] like what you say [ah]
sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> will follow from a distance which I can still like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [lah] you know then
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
there was one guy who even like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan] then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
[ah] ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door [ah]
and actually because I want to lean [ah] because I <malay>malas</malay>
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya !oops! I cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so I'm just like [oh] I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
recently [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I want to move to the west side because
most of the not most of the jobs that I want [lah] but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang mo kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
ya so it's like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
I mean not easier [lah] it will be
life you know like sometimes the the <malay>kerja</malay> is like so far away from your <malay>rumah</malay> then it's like (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> ya
so ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't (uh) what
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
I cannot [lah] I I just for me I feel I get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
ya [lah] cause in #ang mo kio# like <malay>macam</malay> nobody ever sleeps
so it's damn irritating
then sometimes like three [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon</malay> then <malay>dia orang ketawa</malay> like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
I don't know [ah] I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID [lah] so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
<malay>apa</malay>
my plan
[a'ah]
but I think he don't want [lah]
because he also still studying then he want to like (uh) like what you say [lah] <malay>macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu</malay>
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
<malay>sebab dia nak jadi</malay> teacher so now he studying the subject
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
because he wants to work at <malay>punya</malay> kind of school
then I'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't <malay>kerja</malay> you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
say before that he is <malay>macam</malay>
like when he got school [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay>
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
(uh) but then that semester break it I think is is <malay>macam</malay> charity
that's why just like normal expenditure [kan] it's not like saving for a house <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes I wish I just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
[ah] <malay>cina</malay> [lah]
