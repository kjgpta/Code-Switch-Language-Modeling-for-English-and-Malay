my two guy friends one of them
(uh) no the the guy the one in the girlfriend
called with us [ah] but he himself is not there
ya <malay>yang</malay> birthday surprise
so the three of us
video called without him for the surprise
(uh) yeah
ya [lah]
<malay>tak salah</malay> [pe]
it's a surprise it's called a surprise
so (uh) we we got plan A and plan B
I mean I mean
I mean like [dah] [dah] <malay>berbual sampai</malay> one one plus
of course have to come up with a solid plan right
no plan A (uh) plan A we go we go #Sentosa#
the beach [lah]
so he and his girlfriend [dah] <malay>kat situ</malay> then me and my other guy friend
come as a surprise
yes I think it'll be fine
why [ah]
why [sia]
so weird
no so go #Sentosa# (uh) we come with a cake and some light snack I think like Pezzo [eh]
then ya
then (uh) we get this combo
you know that now they are promoting tourist stuff for Singaporeans right
yeah so there's packages that you can visit different places
yeah so we we are we are going we are going for this package which which is like (uh) forty two dollars
or go
(uh) the wax museum
Tussauds
ya I think it's that one
(uh) the wax museum some Marvel
<malay>belum</malay>
some Marvel
[dah] that's one for one you know means we can split into two [lah]
ya so split into two (uh)
one for one so two [lah]
yes
yeah
then (uh) that that wax museum (uh)
some Marvel Marvel <malay>punya</malay> like
(uh) what else I forgot [lah] what else <malay>ada kat dia punya</malay> package yesterday I I read together with them then ya [lah]
(uh) later [ah] but basically
basically (uh) those are our activities [lah] for the day
yeah then
after that (uh) they want to eat at satay by the bay is it
I've never been there my entire life
yeah
(uh)
no I know where it is I know
I know where it is but I've never been there to eat
no it's like a hawker centre
but very
the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
(mm)
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
(uh) plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set (uh) we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage (uh)
we set up like a small
you know like my birthday that time <malay>macam</malay>
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
is a company <malay>yang buat</malay>
so this one we do our own [ah] like small picnic mat some food very <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay>
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage [meh] I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
that day <malay>punya</malay> is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
ya
because there were other people [lah] that's the best we could find actually
obviously [lah] everyone will aim for that spot got shade [what]
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus [ah] this is our plan B
so the the the <malay>macam</malay> deciding factor is
(um)
if the birthday boy <malay>bawa</malay> motor <malay>ke tak</malay>
and my guy friend <malay>ni yang</malay> the non-birthday guy
<malay>dapat kereta ke tak</malay> he can drive [what] okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend [ah] [eh] like
you you ask him [lah] go out for once <malay>tak yah bawa</malay> motor then I say but
but I say that will be very suspicious
because ya he then I say you use [lah] the excuse <malay>kalau pergi</malay> #Sentosa# like
parking <malay>mahal</malay> then he say but can park at the #Seah# #Seah Im# [eh] he always park there
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya [lah] like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
<malay>boleh</malay> pass [ah]
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
because he did say he did say that (uh) she did <malay>macam bilang dia</malay>
(uh) on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
[eh] or is it more than two I don't know [lah] but
long enough [lah]
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor [ah] then I said okay then another if if let's say
my other guy friend cannot get a car <malay>kereta bapa dia</malay>
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot [ah]
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
what's the plan [ah] <malay>sudah lupa</malay>
[ah] actually if you ask me frankly I prefer <malay>kalau pergi</malay> Marina Barrage
because [dah] <malay>dekat dengan kedai makan</malay>
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
just just so that <malay>macam tak</malay> waste time on the road I feel [lah]
but
from the other guy he feels that [kan] <malay>macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua</malay> if he <malay>tak bawa</malay> motor
then I'm like he cannot [lah]
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
I I lazy [lah] go through all that <malay>apa</malay> monorail [eh]
but but
okay I'm okay no okay [oh] wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late [oh] yes I remember the deciding factor
okay if we go #Sentosa# we must start like <malay>lepas zohor</malay> [lah] that kind
ya but then he has class <malay>ngaji</malay> so
yeah
weekday cannot [lah] he [what]
then
ya so need to wait he finish <malay>ngaji</malay> by the time like two already then <malay>nak</malay> travel all the way to #Sentosa# three plus
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
<malay>kita kita nya</malay> more like museum attraction kind
it's not really
I know got #Shah Rukh Khan#
you've been with me at Hong Kong
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
what I say just now
no then like [oh] yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
the girlfriend say [ah] sometimes he like <malay>penat</malay> from so he
say he don't want to go for class [ah] he skip that week's class
then I'm like <malay>kalau</malay> he <malay>penat</malay> like you know
yeah
then I but I told her [lah] (uh) whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class [lah] it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
he [dah] <malay>biasa buat</malay>
if he
<malay>siapa</malay>
#Tampines# [ah]
I think [ah]
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back #Tampines# he don't like to go back that house
no [lah] but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near #Tampines# hub there
so
no
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay (uh) <malay>apa</malay> you wouldn't believe it we wanna go #Tampines# hub also <malay>naik</malay> motor
even though it's like <malay>dekat gila</malay>
near #Tampines# hub
no <malay>lapan ratus lebih</malay>
yeah
yeah but ya [lah] he he likes
to <malay>naik</malay> motor [lah] so cannot stop him
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
so if if he still <malay>macam</malay> go for <malay>ngaji</malay> then most likely is Marina Barrage [ah] cause
<malay>macam</malay> we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
<malay>dia</malay> by six sudah <malay>tutup</malay> I think
attraction in #Sentosa#
yeah
six last [eh] entry [eh] something like that
ya [lah] which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
(err) it's very he
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be <malay>biar</malay> [lah]
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay [jer]
yeah
I give my opinions but you know (uh) eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend [lah] cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
you know the <malay>kedai makan dekat sebelah</malay>
I've never eaten there right so I ask him <malay>agak agak berapa</malay> [ah] <malay>kena bayar</malay> like how much is the
food [lah] estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock [ah] I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
<malay>korang korang makan apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dorang beli banyak</malay> [ah] all guys
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them [ah]
I was telling them (uh) I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
then she's like [eh] then I then I told her [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
worse come to worst <malay>aku beli air</malay> [jer] [ah]
then she was like <malay>kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air</malay> [jer]
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah I mean if there's simple food like <malay>nasi goreng mi goreng</malay> I'll buy [lah]
yeah
[eh] but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
(uh) they sell their specialty is what [ah]
[ah] like this type [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shell out [eh] I feel
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing [lah] okay
yeah <malay>macam</malay> I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask (uh) <malay>mana kau nak makan</malay> [ah]
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay [lah] just go with the flow if cannot then cannot [lah]
we can just like
<malay>bawa</malay>
but like
very light food [lah]
cannot eat cannot eat I okay [jer]
(um)
(hmm)
(uh) [eh] (mm)
that that that that's a
that's a good
point [ah] I will tell them <malay>takut</malay> like <malay>penuh</malay>
(uh) I did say if we go #Sentosa# <malay>tak ya gi</malay> Marina Barrage Vivocity area <malay>ada</malay> [pe] then he was like <malay>tak nak nak makan</malay> restaurant #atas# <malay>sikit</malay>
then I'm like
Vivo (uh) that's what I thought (hmm) then <malay>dorang kata apa nak makan apa</malay> Mac then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan [lah]
(um)
then we talk about like other things [lah]
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
<malay>kenal</malay> us [lah] cause she knows like
yeah
that's what she say [ah]
ya and she's not like <malay>malu malu dengan kita</malay>
she she was the one she was the one who said [eh] <malay>korang nak jumpa</malay> for dinner <malay>tak</malay> a few days ago then I was like
<malay>nak</malay> discuss about this [lah]
yeah then I was like <malay>masa tu</malay> I busy
I do a lot of things so
I'm like (uh) I think FaceTime better [ah] but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
#Arshad#
(uh) we were in the same class <malay>tapi kita ada</malay> different clique
[ah] subset [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
one big group
<malay>abeh ada</malay> smaller group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah [lah] you know
those people
no those people [lah]
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
<malay>hari raya</malay> [ah] (hmm)
[oh] the thing is (uh) out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
the the guy <malay>tak suka</malay> the same person I don't like
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
the other guy also don't like <malay>tapi dia pandai bermuka</malay>
yeah yeah
so sometimes <malay>raya</malay> also he never come then I a bit sad [lah] cause like I mean like I close with them [what] then only me and the other guy <malay>ada</malay>
then
ya no loss then he say it's okay (uh) I will go to your house for <malay>raya</malay> with the other guy [lah] just the three of us I'm like okay
ya then ya [lah]
so but then we
ya I think <malay>hari raya</malay> is the only time that whole big group meet
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
#Arshad# say in the group (uh) <malay>apa apa kau kalau tak pergi</malay> then <malay>kita tak nak pergi</malay> [ah]
then I'm like no [ah] don't let me be the deciding factor [ah]
just go anyway I also <malay>bajet</malay> [lah] I spend
<malay>ni nak keluar</malay> for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
(mm) ya true so
I also <malay>macam</malay> don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
now now I'm just like okay go ahead [lah]
it's okay
I said that then then the the other girls they !alah! (uh) <malay>apa</malay> you never go then <malay>macam</malay> boring [ah]
then I say [lah] anyway
<malay>kalau pergi lima orang</malay> then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
(uh) I mean !huh! I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy [lah] but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with #Humaira# and marissa
no <malay>tak pernah pergi</malay>
yeah I realised that (uh) I enjoy going out with
<malay>macam</malay> company just another person
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
<malay>tapi</malay> three three people is still not bad
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends [lah] I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also [what]
ya you see like like #Ria#
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
(mm)
it's okay [lah]

sunday
yeah
yeah I know [ah]
I told you what dorang <malay>kena</malay> <malay>kena buang kerja</malay>
so sad [leh] is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell [what]
no it's because I went there prominent [lah]
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
(err) towards the end towards the end ya [lah] third year
okay [lah] (uh)
I sorry [ah] but ya [lah] that's the difference between you and me [lah] I enjoy [pe]
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me

I remember you were pregnant [lah] last time when you go with me
crazy
I know

it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part [lah]
this is just before you went <malay>umrah</malay>
it's just before you went <malay>umrah</malay>
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride [lah] so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop [what]
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
#Aisha# <malay>aku takut</malay> #Aisha# <malay>aku takut</malay>
ya I told her that then she's like <malay>tak betul</malay> [lah]
(uh)
I got somemore drawing to do
[oh] ya I haven't reply <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
cannot <malay>tangguh</malay> anymore
what was her email [ah]
need to find her email
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] anyway
<malay>semalam</malay> [oh] after we talk about the birthday thing we talk about like other things also [lah]
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about (uh) how
we were saying [lah] we know we know the process of how he met her right
then she a bit <malay>malu</malay> [ah] and then she was like <malay>korang</malay> [tau] [eh] we we know everything
they (uh) he saw her in school but he wants to <malay>kenal kenal</malay> with her right
so found her Instagram
and then
you know you know the line that guy like (uh) <malay>apa</malay> guys like to use or like they [ah] basically he said (uh) <malay>dia</malay> the girl that [eh] <malay>hari tu</malay> I saw you at
<malay>apa macam</malay> like [oh] bazaar #Geylang# <malay>masa tu bulan puasa</malay>
that day I saw you at bazaar <malay>ramadhan</malay> because he saw the stories [lah]
<malay>padahal</malay> he wasn't even there he wasn't even there I saw you at bazaar <malay>ramadhan</malay> (uh) wanted to <malay>tegur</malay> but you look
<malay>macam busy</malay>
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line [lah] I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
why what makes you why why do you think he <malay>lurus bendul</malay>
ya he knows what he wants [ah] that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya (err) also because he knows himself better [lah] learnt from mistakes
last time he used to be a bit <malay>panas baran</malay> if he don't like someone
he will take action
!huh!
I think a bit [lah] he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it [lah]
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling [lah]
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
so that he's not afraid to <malay>macam</malay> confide to you anytime right
(mm)
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what [eh] what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you (uh) it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage [ah]
yeah but you already bloomed [dah]

[oh] my god I didn't know you were such a geek
you know you know when it was me in school when there's a surprise test
then I just look at my friends did you did you study no okay
then just do the test [lah]
I don't I mean
I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story

they never see [ah] I remember my friend
(uh) doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
(uh) are you okay then I'm like off the damn (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
off the damn switch [lah] why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] it's a bit it's just like
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
yeah so <malay>dia punya</malay> like plastic
the sharp edges

so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
it's just a drill <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> he would expect something to go wrong on another machine not a drill
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly
