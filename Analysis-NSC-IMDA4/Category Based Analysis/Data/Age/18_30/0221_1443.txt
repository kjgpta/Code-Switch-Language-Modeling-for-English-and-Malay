then you taste the rotten part of mango and then
your appetite is just lost
but other than that (um)
(uh) this is why we have to (um) always keep our mangoes fresh
and keeps our mango (um)
(um) keep our mangoes fresh and then keep like (um) you know inside the fridge what to let it cool so that it won't rotten that fast
and (um)
other than that (uh)
(uh) ya it's [ah] after you like what he said like (um)
