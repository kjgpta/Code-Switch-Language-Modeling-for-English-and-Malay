(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)

bad parents also but I think overall is okay like
what I want I wouldn't complain anything about it [lah] everything is everything is #gucci#
ya ya
so what you're planning to do for your full time now
(mm) (mm) (mm)
course you <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah]
(mm) <malay>habis</malay>
what kind of careers can you like get from this course though
freelance is it
[oh] cool okay
which
[ah] which company
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) [oh] ya but during your course of study got intern or not [ah]
so (mm)
is that related to your course though
[ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
your cup of tea
(mm)
[ah] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) [oh] the standards is not very high there
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
words (mmhmm)
(mm)
doing (mmhmm)
but I feel like singapore these kind of things is not very exposed like media things going on so like a bit hard [lah] for you right
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) understand understand
ya as for myself also like after I graduate there was no graduation and then wanted to find a full time job also like very <malay>susah</malay> nowadays very very <malay>susah</malay> to find now [ah]
full time jobs and then as you were saying regarding like not what you want but more to survival yes
ya take whatever there is (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
culinary
ya <malay>masak masak</malay>
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(uh huh)
ya it's true (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya that's true <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
[ah] but from this situation also like a lot of thing was affected like we can't even like travel anymore or like go to concerts and stuff like that and I don't even know when will we
ya partly [oh] my god ya I feel like it affected us especially us youngsters [ah] <malay>budak budak sekarang</malay>
fun things like what
(mm) ya
(mm) [oh] ya all these are all affected
even our <malay>hari raya</malay> visiting is like affected ya
(mm)
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but also depends on each person [lah] because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that [one] can affect us like a lot
(err) yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
like I feel I feel like as we age [ah] and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
and then like we appreciate our alone time more instead of like going out constantly I mean going out with friends (uh) <malay>macam</malay> time to time okay [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) ya I understand
(mm) (hmm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way [lah] but it's just slow
(mm) (mm) (mm) [oh] my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
(mm)
(mm) our blessings
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right (mm) (mm) (mm)
a change [lah]
progress
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
close minded [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue [ah] about all these matters but then come to come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional [lah] due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that [one] is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
(mm) (mm)
thinking
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that [one] actually like kind of assured me
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)

for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things [lah] like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas [ah]
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you [ah] so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay [lah] so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it [what]
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
(mm)
the floorball is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
get through with it
(uh huh) [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] math was the only one you failed
but
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear [sia]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it [lah] if not it's like really tiring for you
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] floorball
that is going to affect your grade more [sia]
exams
[oh] my god O-level
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a (um)
really
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
really
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before [lah] in singapore [ah] like a popular way
weird why
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
[ah] [oh] ya
[oh] ya we had the camp
!huh!
really
this the first time I ever heard someone say I look like a <malay>minah</malay>
vibes [ah]
(mm) (mm)
but I think we achieved quite
a lot [lah] from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember [sia]
[oh] the <malay>dinding</malay> [eh]
(mm) ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head [ah] but I think executing part [ah]
that [one] is not for me [ah]
that's true
(mm)
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw [lah]
why [ah]
[oh] [oh] why though [ah]
why [ah]
[oh] [ah] ya ya ya
ya [sia] !haiya!
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
tertiary is what secondary [ah]
[oh] primary secondary or poly [ah]
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school I was like really young so I didn't have any like
quite a good memory of it <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] then after that like but then
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was #aite# but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me [lah]
so I would choose the primary school [lah] cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from #ahmad ibrahim# at #yishun#
and my mum was a <malay>cikgu</malay> there she was a teacher there also
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in #ahmad ibrahim# for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that (uh) I moved to #serangoon# so I had to transfer myself so I went to #pei hwa# at #sengkang#
so that was when I had like
so [eh] no #pei hwa# was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at #sengkang#
so that was where [oh] wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at #ahmad ibrahim# right I joined
(err) skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there [ah] and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that [one] and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport [lah]
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping [eh] so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow [lah]
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper [ah] that [one]
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went [ah]
[ah] I think so
I think so but I really forget [sia] I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that (err) okay that's all then my primary school was
(err) skipping [lah] then after that I went to anchorgreen #sengkang#
and then that's at #sengkang# and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
[ah]
[ah] no we have three types of dances all
[ah] we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing [lah] so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones [one] I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
<malay>tak tak</malay> dance no
(uh) I enjoy dancing but I mean just for fun [lor] I mean sometimes I just like you know <malay>jumpa kawan</malay> dance that's all and like ya that's it
[ah] ya [lah] those [lah] ya just for fun
!huh! really I feel so shy <malay>malu</malay>
really
from what like
just like interest (uh huh)
personally I feel free styling is like
hard [sia] for me
(mm) (mm)
because it's up to you also [what] right ya
okay
[ah]
(err) for me I don't know [eh] I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand [eh] this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
[ah]
(uh) I think I don't know [ah] I mean if like one person do on her own [ah] I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people that kind then it's okay [ah]
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban [lah] like
I don't understand the nice to it [lah] hip hop that's like that's like nice [ah] I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
[oh] I even joined a kayaking (uh) competition
and ya in
#polys# [ah] I mean organised it
but it was secondary school (err) but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite (err) like an achievement for us [ah]
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our
like you know it's not our kayaking it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that (err) then we got
kayaking and stuff [oh] there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
is normally with
so sometimes when do things we'll also do things [ah] like those like
(err) camps and shit and stuff is normally with [eh] so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay [lah] cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
(err) secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very good
teachers [ah] I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like [meh] so I don't
ya so I didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
culinary (um) <malay>belajar</malay> I mean okay [lah] actually I joined this course because like there was a part where they talked about barista
then I like [ah] ice cream ice cream coffee coffee <malay>gitu</malay> then after that
[oh] ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course [lah]
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful [lah] the the environment the the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but [meh] not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school [lah]
poly like not really [eh] maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me [lah] ya
(mm) actually I did [ah] but I feel like my
I feel like my not good enough
but you want to go poly <malay>nak pergi</malay> poly [eh] uni sorry
(mm) there's no design [meh]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay (mm) okay okay okay okay
I didn't know (uh) (uh) media is like so enhanced like so many things
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
(mm)
[oh] like you the posters and stuff [lah]
[ah]
[oh] [oh] cool cool cool
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is up to you
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
then you should like work for like those (mm) shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing [what] no [meh]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) then you should open a YouTube channel
why
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya I also just realised that [sia]
culinary was really just because of the coffee part [lah] really
actually [ah] if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know [eh] honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my I design the poster also right
I don't know [sia]
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places [lah] [hor]
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide [ah]
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now [ah] they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says [eh] like (err) experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like (uh) signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the the uni [one] honestly
so I don't know [lah] so I don't when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
!wow!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like (err) capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) ya that's true
