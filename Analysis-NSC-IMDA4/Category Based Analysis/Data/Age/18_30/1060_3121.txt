okay (um)
you know I was wondering right
would you rather good looks or a fit body because I see like everybody
everybody especially now because we got like coming up soon
everybody are like they want to train and what not
I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
honestly I feel like good looks is <malay>macam</malay>
genetic [ah] like <malay>kalau</malay> your parents
are good looking then
you <malay>macam</malay>
you lucky [ah]
cause you because
I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
you will get you will
good looks <malay>bukan benda yang</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> work for but fit body is
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
<malay>dia tak boleh dapat</malay> any other way
(um)
okay [lah] (err) I mean
make sense [oh] going off of that
(err)
I <malay>pun nak tanya</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
because you were saying like [oh] live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
cause (err) I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay <malay>kalau tak salah</malay>
then like
<malay>dia orang</malay>
(err)
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like (um)
note notes [lah] about (err) extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
because <malay>macam</malay>
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I (err)
I <malay>baru baru-baru ni</malay> I <malay>main apa tu</malay>
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
<malay>abeh</malay>
I I <malay>main</malay> [kan] then I noticed [ah]
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang nak pergi nak nak</malay> fly back <malay>dari</malay> like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>kalau kita orang</malay> (err)
<malay>kalau</malay>
(um)
<malay>kalau manusia nak</malay>
<malay>kalau manusia</malay> were to be extinct right
then I <malay>rasa</malay>
the the the
most likely way would be <malay>dari</malay> viruses <malay>macam</malay> COVID [lah] that kind cause we are so
we're so interconnected [lah] it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
<malay>macam dunia ni dah macam gitu tapi</malay>
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good [lah]
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
you never ever really hear about them <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>tak ada banyak orang yang pergi</malay> africa
if we <malay>tapi kalau</malay>
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up (um)
going to africa to like visit <malay>ke apa</malay>
then
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places <malay>tapi</malay> like if you also see right
africa <malay>pun dia orang punya</malay> COVID cases not very high
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
so <malay>kita orang tak
<malay>tak</malay> prepared [lah] <malay>kira</malay>
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
I <malay>faham</malay> I <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>tu tu</malay> okay <malay>tu kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> population <malay>turun</malay> [kan]
in my in my opinion [ah]
the world gets better in a sense <malay>pasal</malay>
the the one problem that we're facing now is <malay>terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup</malay> (err) <malay>tak cukup</malay> resources <malay>macam</malay> you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
(err) too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things [lah] but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
so in a way unless like if yes our <malay>kita orang punya</malay> population <malay>turun</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay> like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct <malay>pasal</malay> there will come a point where
we will be like [eh]
<malay>dah cukup</malay> like now we finally have enough
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion [ah] I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
(err)
enough with that deep stuff
[ah] this one is
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> (err)
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh dapat tiga</malay> skill
<malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>apa-apa</malay> skill [lah] you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> skill <malay>yang mungkin</malay> you <malay>pilih</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah]
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
so <malay>kira</malay> like you you can you play soccer so <malay>kira</malay> maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
that's what I mean
any kind of skill [lah] like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
okay
I feel like
you <malay>punya</malay>
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
(err) let me go by one to three (err) first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is (um)
<malay>apa</malay> third one <malay>tadi</malay>
okay [lah] I feel like that <malay>yang yang</malay> the last one is
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
you you <malay>tak boleh</malay> manage stress <malay>you</malay> are done
ya
in in my in my opinion [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for [lah] especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
because I run like competitively so I <malay>rasa macam ada orang yang</malay>
(err)
<malay>yang yang yang</malay> very
very pumped up very excited
<malay>nak nak pergi dia orang suka</malay> competition <malay>macam gini</malay> and all that stuff
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> I [kan] <malay>suka</malay> competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part [lah]
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you [dah] <malay>kerja dah dah dah dah</malay> train [dah] work very hard for it
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need [lah] to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything [lah] that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like !wah! all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
!wah! actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya [lah] I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally [lah] I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> physical [jer] <malay>tapi</malay>
also <malay>dari segi</malay> mental
<malay>boleh tolong</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan]
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
so <malay>kalau kira</malay> I <malay>tengah buat</malay>
(err) example [lah] during (err) exam during exam period <malay>kira kita orang</malay> stressed <malay>dari</malay> like <malay>buat</malay> maths mathematics <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari</malay> and all that stuff <malay>ni benda yang</malay> I <malay>rasa orang lain tak faham</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam dia orang kira</malay> [oh]
<malay>main</malay> sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but <malay>dia orang tak faham yang</malay> like for people like us people <malay>yang selalu buat</malay> sports and all that
it's like our safe place [ah] like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
cause <malay>macam</malay> you do math then you are like !wah!
!wah! <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
then you will like !wah! then you even more stress you you feel even more like <malay>lebih teruk</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> like
<malay>dari dari pendapat saya</malay>
I <malay>macam</malay>
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was (err) stress management number two would be to be very good at
(err) running
then number three I feel would be
(um)
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I can okay there are times when I can read situation <malay>betul betul tapi</malay>
I just feel like
!aiya!
don't bother [lah] just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and like most sometimes it can be bad [lah] like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
you know so <malay>kira</malay> you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
so I <malay>rasa</malay> like that's one thing that I can work on [lah] and that's something that I should work on
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more [oh] yes
<malay>apakah sesuatu yang</malay> you
you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak yang</malay> you wish that would be free
anything like anything in the world
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge <malay>dari segi wang tapi juga macam</malay> you don't have to work for it
you know
like it just comes <malay>macam gitu</malay>
you wish for it and it comes that kind
(mm) okay that's true
okay [lah] then we keep it to <malay>benda</malay> physical [lah] like <malay>macam yang benda</malay> monetary [ah] monetary
<malay>dari segi wang</malay>
anything
free <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>kita sendiri</malay>
(uh)
(hmm)
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
because in my opinion <malay>macam</malay>
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
and <malay>macam</malay> you will feel very purposeless
like <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
<malay>kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>tak kerja tak</malay> like training <malay>macam kita orang</malay>
<malay>dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> then like I have had
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang</malay> feel very purposeless <malay>tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis</malay> exam [kan] <malay>abeh dia orang</malay>
<malay>tak payah belajar</malay> and all that stuff
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like !wah! I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
okay [lah] you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems <malay>macam</malay> world hunger and all that stuff you know
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose [lah]
in that sense
so it would really
it will help not only myself but it would help <malay>orang lain</malay>
ya
so
that's for me
then (err)
(mm) [oh] ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
<malay>satu hari macam</malay> in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it [lah] but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool [lah] in my opinion
ya ya
[oh] building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both [lah] so
can be any
I mean you know mine [lah] mine would probably be batman [lah]
ya just because he's <malay>dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang</malay>
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him <malay>macam</malay> different
<malay>macam</malay> he will not stop until
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
<malay>dia tak dia tak bunuh orang dia tak buat benda yang macam</malay>
that he that <malay>dia dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> deems as
(um) not good [lah] so basically whatever he does is really <malay>untuk kebaikan orang lain</malay> that kind and he will like do anything for his family
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
the the the common <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>baca</malay> comics [kan] the common like theme throughout <malay>semua yang semua</malay>
(err) comic comic batman
is that
<malay>dia</malay> very rarely <malay>dia</malay> make mistakes
because <malay>dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja dia betul-betul</malay> make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when <malay>dia pun</malay>
(err)
<malay>apa tu dia pun</malay> makes mistake [lah] because he's human [what] so
in my opinion it will be batman [lah]
ya ya (mm)
[oh] carrying on with that because you know how batman <malay>selalu macam</malay>
they are labelled as
<malay>kadang-kadang</malay> in like comic <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>baca</malay>
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>orang lain</malay>
put on you
can be good can be bad you you just say [lah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah]
I mean [oh] so basically it is that concept of with great ya [lah] like you said [lah] with great power comes great responsibility in a sense [lah] I mean in this sense it'll be
a label <malay>tapi macam</malay>
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff [lah] that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school [lah] like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
it is an idea <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> okay so
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones [lah]
that that label that [oh] he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like <malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] you know
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
I don't know [lah] I I do like you I <malay>macam</malay> plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence <malay>kira</malay> then you
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
you know you get what I mean <malay>kira</malay>
ya [lah]
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are <malay>kira</malay> unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like [eh] how come you today like a bit slow [eh] how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like [ah]
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
<malay>kira</malay> it can be good [lah]
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya (mm)
(mm)
given your current life [kan] like <malay>kerja</malay> cause <malay>kita orang baru habis</malay> (err) exam
<malay>tapi</malay> like if let's say like five six years from now
what would your ideal day in life be
<malay>lepas lepas</malay> <malay>lepas</malay> uni <malay>bila dah</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> [ah]
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
to be fair I also <malay>macam</malay> I I feel the same way as you
the difference is like like in terms of
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say <malay>kalau</malay>
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
people you <malay>nak kasih dia orang apa yang</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak ada</malay>
then
like
I I <malay>pun nak macam gitu tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
training people
so like being a coach cause <malay>sekarang</malay> like I I already sort of do that [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
(err)
I go back to school then like I help some of my I <malay>tolong</malay> coach I
to like (err) <malay>ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu</malay> [lah]
then I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
<malay>lagipun</malay>
like if you are talking about ideal day
it will probably be <malay>pagi</malay>
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
they especially <malay>kalau lari</malay> [kan] so like morning will probably be an easy run
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff [lah] we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
<malay>tengah hari</malay> probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably <malay>macam benda</malay> technical and all that stuff which I can also do [lah] in that sense which would be better because in a sense <malay>kalau</malay> you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people [lah] but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like [eh] setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that [lah] this is of course like you said assuming <malay>yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam</malay> (err) my life [lah] that kind
ya
I don't know I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> ideal life is very training centric
but ya
is is is
it's fun [lah]
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it [lah] you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete [lah] that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand [lah] that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from
