(um) so how is school these days
ya true
so my school starts actually for now it's like (um) <malay>tengah</malay> holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october
october nineteen <malay>tu pun</malay> now is just only like semester one [jer] <malay>belum</malay> semester two then like it's still like year one so
<malay>macam</malay> I feel like year one <malay>ni lama gila</malay>
you know
(um)
then
ya my friends also like <malay>nak ajak</malay> hang out also my friend you know sarah
she <malay>ada</malay> club so she sarah and #nasrul# <malay>ni</malay> (uh) both of them is club is school of applied science <malay>punya</malay>
[ah] is more like your own course <malay>habis</malay> is more of like leadership <malay>punya</malay> kind of
then (um) <malay>tak salah</malay>
sarah also [oh]
sarah have like (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> event [ah] for their (um) for their so she's the one that like <malay>macam</malay> like overall in charge
so <malay>ada ada</malay> (um) <malay>ada ada</malay> groups <malay>yang kena buat</malay> event <malay>tu</malay> one is her group <malay>kena pilih</malay> another one is another group <malay>tapi nashrul punya</malay> group like (um) <malay>tak kena</malay> chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week <malay>baru</malay> like we
me and #nashrul# all meet [ah]
cause sarah also busy with her
but
I also have my own <malay>tapi tak apa lagi</malay> <malay>pasal malas</malay>
ya <malay>pasal malas</malay>
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but (um) now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
<malay>kita kena pergi sekolah balik</malay>
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so (um)
when your exam start bro
honestly I respect those people <malay>yang macam dia orang sudah</malay> like for two years
and then doing the same thing that <malay>budak</malay> poly <malay>buat</malay> then having to go through the same thing like for another three years <malay>kat</malay> poly it's just so tiring and exhausting [ah] that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> they choose to just work
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
<malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
for me like for example [eh]
poly [kan] <malay>macam</malay> also is like poly so like I feel like <malay>macam ni</malay> poly example I take it as [eh] having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
(um) I would consider [ah] because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
it's not like <malay>macam</malay> easy you know like for those people who really like (um)
<malay>buat</malay> the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
exhausting [ah] like what I see that's why I really
salute those people who <malay>macam</malay> have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to (um) poly ya
then for me also like my results it's (um) released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also [eh] will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like (um) because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
phase is just (um) submitting your diploma ranking course [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah [kan] <malay>dia dapat</malay> interview so <malay>dia</malay> pass interview and then she already get her what [ah] her results that like she can go in like like her place for
(um) pharmaceutical science <malay>memang sudah</malay> chop chop for her so macam</malay> okay [lah] she <malay>sudah selamat</malay> she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because <malay>dia memang</malay> can already it's like
so <malay>macam kalau</malay> interview <malay>sudah</malay> pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all [lah]
but for me because my interview <malay>tak dapat</malay>
so like
now focus solely on which is (uh) <malay>kita orang</malay> <malay>pasal kita orang tak ada</malay> exam also so they look
over (um) they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day <malay>macam</malay> for us [kan] <malay>ada orang</malay> like
(um) <malay>sekolah dia orang satu hari</malay> is like is combination of subjects but for me is like <malay>kalau</malay> math is
maths [jer] for that day so like after that day they will like grade us [oh] how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want [lah] of course my expectation is higher
then after that <malay>kalau</malay> there's a mixture of A and B is <malay>banyak</malay> and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like (um) three to four
<malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>kalau macam</malay> C <malay>banyak gitu</malay> then maybe around two point five to three point five <malay>gitu</malay> then (um)
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
like <malay>baru berapa</malay> compared to my other two friend I think they did more better [lah] in a sense
then
so like
(um)
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech <malay>memang nak</malay> try <malay>dapat</malay> biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like <malay>mati-mati nak</malay> biomedical science [jer] like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
it's okay
but the thing he <malay>tak</malay> put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense [lah] cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them [oh] what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure (um) and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise [kan] and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me [lah] then my daily grade from
biology also <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> A
A <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard [lah] cause it's the (um) they focus (um) on biology the most
like it's important subject [lah]
so ya (um)
then
so like this semester <malay>tak ada</malay> exam so I next semester <malay>ada</malay> exam
for sure but (um) for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable [lah]
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay <malay>pasal</malay> assignment <malay>dia pun</malay> is
<malay>tak banyak</malay> like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day [kan] like through read virtually like other then after that (um)
teacher will give us like (uh) practice questions to do
<malay>habis ada</malay> quiz <malay>juga</malay> that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
[eh] eleven five nine
then the practice question is like <malay>biasa macam</malay> homework <malay>gitu</malay>
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time (um)
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to (um) type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
mostly <malay>banyak</malay> presentation but it's good [lah]
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm (um) when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages <malay>pasal</malay> like I think you will feel like
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before (um) [eh] like when you presenting and all
then (um) for me [kan] like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
<malay>kalau</malay> I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu [kan] is just like my weakness like
whatever I say [kan] confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya (um)
ya
and then
also ya
then <malay>pasal</malay> presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [lah] but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates <malay>yang</malay>
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
ours
is different [seh] we like on that day [kan] the presentation on that day you have to [ah] prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation <malay>punya tu</malay>
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break [lah] [kan]
ya
(mm)
and it was (uh) two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
sometimes I'm like !wow! <malay>kita dah</malay> eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near (um) uniforms so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old [lah] then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> actually it's normal <malay>macam biasa</malay> like !wow! it's just normal [lah] honestly
ya
(mm)
and it's okay cause <malay>macam tak ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we don't really take that into my mind <malay>macam</malay> [oh] like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like <malay>keluar</malay> dates with you know I think
I don't really mind [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I have a boyfriend or not as long as <malay>macam</malay> that is like (um) <malay>kawan dekat</malay> you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me <malay>pasal</malay> later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
(mm) no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
[eh] but for her [kan] NAFA
NAFA is like [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
really
[oh]
[eh] !wow! I didn't know that
[oh] my god that's so much friends
seriously
like different people also like different [lah] honestly like (um) the things that they're prioritising and it's all like <malay>semua ada masing-masing</malay> [lah] <malay>hanya</malay>
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of worries like [oh] <malay>pasal duit</malay> and all that of course you want your family to be <malay>macam</malay> stable [lah] like in every (um) ya in everything you know
ya
it's very hard [lah] like I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> family <malay>tak cannot like <malay>tak tak ada</malay> like stability and all that [kan] I feel like [ah] one day confirm will fall apart <malay>punya</malay>
for sure
and some more I also like the type of person <malay>yang tak</malay> message <malay>orang</malay>
like !wow! <malay>kalau dah malas dia punya malas</malay> is <malay>malas tak aku boleh</malay> like
for one week straight <malay>tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa</malay> cause like I'm that type of person [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !wah! like heartbreak this heartbreak <malay>gila babi</malay> you know like that kind
but then like !wah! like <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
I'm proud of myself like !wow!
but even though like there are times <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam nak ada orang</malay> like to be by your side like a boyfriend [lah] okay <malay>kirakan</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
<malay>kita boleh</malay> get over it [lah] there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
ya same
same [lah] as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see (um) every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
(um) gone
so like sometimes <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] <malay>ada</malay> family gathering [kan] it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something [ah] even my sister like
like (uh) video call her friends during [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm having a dinner so I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay [lah] <malay>kalau ada kawan tu</malay> okay but then like <malay>kalau</malay> it's time to like for your family you focus on your family [jer] <malay>tak mahu</malay> get mixed [lah] like video call with friends like
other time you can do [what] like <malay>kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang</malay> like <malay>jumpa kawan habis kat rumah</malay> also like <malay>kawan</malay> then like when are you going to like you know (um)
(mm) spend time with your family not really ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family [kan] is like
!wow! I'm lucky to be in such a family kind <malay>punya</malay> vibes cause different family different [ah] <malay>ada</malay> family like focus (um)
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future <malay>kalau nak ada family</malay> I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then <malay>kalau</malay> like my <malay>anak-anak macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>ke</malay> girlfriend <malay>ke aku macam nak bagi</malay> advice <malay>sikit</malay>
