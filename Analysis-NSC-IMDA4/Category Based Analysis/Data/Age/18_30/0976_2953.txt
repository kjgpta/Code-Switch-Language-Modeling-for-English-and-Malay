okay (uh) <malay>kau nak</malay> start
okay (uh) my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing (uh) marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
(err) okay first
<malay>aku</malay> join poly through which is the polytechnic foundation programme so from N levels supposed <malay>aku gi</malay>
(uh) higher NITEC but then I found out that (uh)
I got a chance to go [ah] because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly (err) through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
<malay>ada ada minat</malay> [ah] so <malay>aku tak ada</malay> problem
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay>
like why why are you not (uh) interested
(mm)
(uh)
what else
okay (uh) so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay [lah]
ya
for me is (uh)
<malay>aku tengah</malay> doing #muay thai#
(uh)
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
<malay>dari silat</malay> then go squash
apparently now is #muay thai#
which I find (uh) more interesting than the others [ah] in terms of
(err) social connection and all that
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> is just
it's not my thing [ah] <malay>dikir barat</malay>
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because (uh)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> stage fright
then maybe because of that <malay>abeh dikir barat</malay> as I see is quite interesting [ah] like to watch not to do it yourself you get ya so
I guess now #muay thai# is going well so far
(uh) training quite intense so ya
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay>
that's the difference [ah] <malay>aku sebab</malay>
(err) that is <malay>macam</malay>
competition (uh)
not not a performance kind of competition [lah]
<malay>macam tu aku</malay> fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>sepak takraw</malay> [pe] so
that that competition <malay>macam orang tengok</malay> is normal
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
(mmhmm)
okay secondary school life okay actually because (err)
<malay>aku</malay> since young (uh) <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
not really sociable [lah] <malay>aku</malay> is a introvert ya
so
since primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> introvert so
but primary school [lah] <malay>aku</malay> still had this <malay>macam</malay> close friends so <malay>aku</malay> still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
still join <malay>takraw</malay> which is good and made a lot of friends there
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it [ah] and I go through it ya you go
(mm)
[ah]
so
is naughty [eh]
(uh)
okay that's the tough part <malay>sebab aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really got problem thus <malay>aku</malay> student counsellor so so <malay>aku tak boleh macam</malay> mess up [lah] so basically but the student council part also <malay>aku</malay> it wasn't
my choice [ah] because (err) sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
and then (err) <malay>dorang kira</malay> [kan]
<malay>sebab aku</malay> really from a
secondary school that is known to be
(uh) for like naughty kids [ah] and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
<malay>aku</malay> considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor [lah] in sec two ya
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>tak nak sebab aku</malay> just just <malay>malas</malay> [ah] then so (uh) the funny thing is
<malay>aku</malay> didn't even go for the interview even though I had to [lah]
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the (uh) the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
<malay>dorang dorang naik dekat</malay> (uh) assembly hall <malay>panggil aku dorang tanya</malay> (err)
why you never go for the interview and all that
okay <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say [oh] you got duty today then I'm like what
he's like [oh] ya ya you're a student counsellor [what] ya ya so I
wasn't expected [ah] but then I was just like
okay [lah] never mind I just I just take the role [lah] do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like (err)
naughty stuff that I did at least
[ah]
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya <malay>nanti ada orang hantar aku</malay>
go to sick bay <malay>nanti aku cakap</malay> stomachache and all that
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
guilty <malay>tak sangat</malay> right ya then
other then that (uh) not much [ah]
but to be honest <malay>aku rasa dorang tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi dorang</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
<malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] can just go just go
ya like I think right after N level [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> first job <malay>aku</malay> was (uh) burger king which <malay>aku</malay> finds
still retail the the best (uh) job that I did [lah] as experience because okay I started
(err) in twenty seventeen which is (err) N level twenty seventeen after N levels (uh)
I join (uh) because a lot of my classmates work there also
so <malay>aku</malay> just join and then they quickly like train me
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun [lah] for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent [ah] because usually
(err) we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
(mm)
[oh]
a lot
(mm)
(mm)
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also [ah] and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
(mm)
so
after staff day <malay>takde lagi</malay>
(err) actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then (err) so compared to retail
(err) in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then (uh) imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like (err) how how can I help you then they like [oh] no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes [ah] then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king [lah]
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did (err)
photo booth (err)
kind of job
kind of [lah] because <malay>dorang macam</malay> (err) <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
(uh) business <malay>kecil</malay> so (uh)
<malay>macam</malay> referral [kan] so <malay>aku kerja</malay>
and then
the pay was quite good [ah] like three hours
I think <malay>aku dapat</malay> thirty forty
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
<malay>kau kerja</malay> is a different environment
so <malay>kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam</malay> some [ah] [a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> just at some park or some event
which was fun [ah] I got experience a lot
(uh) ya
that's all for the job experience [ah]
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute [eh]
it was terrible but (uh)
<malay>jadi</malay>
[eh] <malay>apa dah kerja</malay>
<malay>sekolah</malay>
(err) I think part of
the job experience also is why we
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about <malay>sebab aku lagi</malay> prefer hands on
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) business and all that
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yup
so next year <malay>kita dua gi</malay> internship
ya
yup
shore
you quite excited [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> shore
(mm)
(uh) <malay>aku</malay>
so <malay>aku gi belayar</malay> second sem
which is exciting [ah] <malay>untuk aku sebab aku pun</malay> join <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> sailing the part
so six months sailing
exciting <malay>tapi</malay>
scary <malay>juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam</malay>
just one month of it how how can I cope [lah]
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of (uh) career
for me
<malay>sebab aku pun</malay> planning (uh)
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore (err)
<malay>aku</malay> start family and all that so ya
exciting [ah]
<malay>aku rasa kau</malay>
even though internship <malay>kau dapat</malay> shore [kan]
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> there's still a chance <malay>untuk kau</malay> sail in the future you know <malay>macam kalau kau</malay> still carry on with this career then <malay>aku rasa</malay> why not <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> diploma <malay>kau ada</malay> experience
so think is okay [lah]
<malay>takyah</malay> disappointed <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> stuck at shore
yes <malay>sebab untuk aku</malay> (err)
<malay>aku</malay> rather sacrifice
<malay>aku punya</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> (uh)
to have a stable living [ah] for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family [lah]
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine <malay>macam</malay>
nine to five job [kan]
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
[ah] exactly <malay>jadi untuk aku macam</malay> it's worth it [lah] <malay>kau</malay> go for six months
then got free for like like three months <malay>gitu</malay> three or more then
to be really you with your family [ah] and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
(mmhmm)
yup
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>aku</malay> reach <malay>macam tiga puluh empat puluh</malay> is
you can pull down [ah] ya you can come back to shore maybe (err) continue as lecturer I you relax [ah] ya
even workshop <malay>takpe</malay> [sia] fun so
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah]
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh)
honestly following the trend [kan] <malay>aku rasa aku</malay>
we'll probably be posted to firefighting <malay>tapi</malay> personally <malay>aku nak</malay> army
ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just
<malay>aku ada</malay> interest in the armed forces <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> the army navy <malay>ataupun</malay> air force [ah]
so (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> firefighting <malay>pun untuk aku</malay> okay
<malay>tapi aku</malay> really <malay>tak nak</malay>
police
<malay>sebab macam bukan bukan wayang</malay>
(um) <malay>macam dari dari kecil</malay>
<malay>aku main bola bawah blok ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>atau aku gi</malay> skate <malay>ke apa nanti dorang datang</malay> screen <malay>abeh</malay>
(uh) it was a
ya and then since young <malay>aku</malay> had that (uh)
image of them <malay>macam dorang</malay> just
<malay>datang sini</malay> screen screen <malay>macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah</malay>
(err) <malay>aku pergi</malay> seven eleven <malay>beli</malay> maggi <malay>apa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang</malay> screen check check EZ-link <malay>semua aku</malay> don't find it
<malay>macam</malay> practical [lah] <malay>macam kau</malay> just <malay>kacau aku</malay> [kan] at this point [ah] so I never really had the interest for police
ya
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag <malay>aku</malay>
and it was like
[oh] what what yes
maybe <malay>dorang</malay> check <malay>rokok ke apa abeh aku</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just found it like like weird [lah] to be honest like until now also I still feel
(uh)
that sense of (err)
I I take it personally [ah] sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at <malay>nanti dorang tengok aku</malay>
[ah] [ah]
<malay>dorang tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang dorang panggil</malay> and <malay>dorang</malay> check bag <malay>aku macam</malay> just
why [ah]
but ya that's why <malay>aku tak nak</malay> police
then <malay>kau</malay>
ya
frogmen
(mm)
<malay>sama</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> air force
<malay>dorang pun ada lain punya</malay>
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> engineering <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>ada</malay> communications <malay>punya</malay> part
I because to be pilot also <malay>susah</malay>
so
<malay>kalau dorang</malay> offer <malay>kau untuk macam</malay> (uh) continue
posted to air force [eh] <malay>kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam</malay>
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I think <malay>boleh</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> the thing is I went for the
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
(mm) so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test [ah]
[ah] <malay>ada dorang macam</malay> test <malay>kau punya</malay>
mathematics [lor] they call it arithmetics
so <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
(err) at that point of time
(err) <malay>aku betul-betul nak</malay> so
months before that [kan] <malay>aku aku</malay> practice with this movie so <malay>aku aku tengok</malay> youtube video
<malay>aku</malay> take online test
unfortunately <malay>aku tak dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak bilang</malay> score
pay is
but that's the air force [ah] I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
(uh)
<malay>sebab dia ada aku rasa</malay> eight to ten different tests
so
(uh) <malay>ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah</malay>
but
honestly overall <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> did not bad
ya so <malay>tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
then hopefully just continue marine engineering [lah]
okay obviously <malay>kalau ada</malay>
the different opportunities
<malay>aku aku</malay> definitely would
ya consider
honestly <malay>kalau</malay>
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup (uh) I I don't mind any (uh) what you call that like areas [ah]
the job areas like engineering <malay>atau</malay> (uh) communications
<malay>kalau</malay> pilot [lah] who don't mind
(mm)
ya
ya
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> cockpit <malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> [ah]
so
ya
<malay>aku tengok macam</malay> national days <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti ada dia punya</malay> jet like cool [lah] <malay>untuk aku</malay>
but ya
what else
(mm)
what about copy [ah]
primary school life
spent there six years [eh] primary school
<malay>sama sama sama</malay> six years
which are compared to our different stages [lah]
so <malay>macam aku untuk aku</malay> primary school is when you develop your own (uh) character
ya
ya
<malay>sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku</malay> primary <malay>macam</malay> the most important
ya
(mm) yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending [ah]
[ah] the jump style
but ya primary school <malay>aku</malay> is (uh)
I think to through <malay>sepak takraw</malay> also
<malay>aku</malay>
(err) develop <malay>aku punya</malay> own personality
it's about (err) other than that
is <malay>aku</malay>
I'm a quite <malay>macam</malay> quiet person
<malay>jadi aku dalam</malay> class <malay>pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi bila aku</malay> join <malay>takraw baru aku macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>jumpa orang-orang ni semua</malay> and
I was quite good at it [ah] <malay>sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw</malay>
and then the coach was the one that <malay>macam kira</malay> recruit <malay>aku</malay>
through my brothers [ah] <malay>dia dia nampak aku dia cakap</malay> [eh] join [ah] join [ah] <malay>takraw</malay>
then then (uh) <malay>aku</malay> join and then
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
and then (err) it was funny [ah] <malay>sebab aku</malay> was
I was quite small in terms of size
(err) whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said [oh] you you sub the big one with the small one [ah]
but I I didn't mind [lah] because I know my potential and then from there (uh)
coach <malay>aku pun macam</malay> confident <malay>aku boleh main</malay>
so
by primary
I think by primary four <malay>aku</malay> managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four <malay>aku</malay> the captain at junior team and then primary five <malay>aku</malay> captain of senior team
ya so
ya ya that's why <malay>dari situ aku macam belajar macam</malay> this leadership roles
<malay>macam macam mana nak</malay> (uh)
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
<malay>sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sekolah</malay>
<malay>kalau aku tak buat</malay> homework <malay>pun dorang macam marah</malay>
so so ya
primary school was fun [lah] cause of <malay>takraw</malay> I mean
ya
#tekong#
(uh) depends
<malay>sebab kalau kalau</malay> (err)
okay usually striker is on your on the #tekong's# right
and then feeder is on the #tekong's# left
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> depending on #tekong# <malay>kalau dia</malay> left hand <malay>ke</malay> ya
(uh) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
usually striker and jumper for right leg
and then if the #tekong# is left legged then feeder <malay>nak kena belajar campak</malay>
ya
!wah! I think after almost ten years playing
(uh)
I mostly play either #tekong#
<malay>atau</malay> striker
<malay>tapi aku lagi suka</malay> striker
<malay>yang boleh bebas selang</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>takraw</malay> was fun [lah] <malay>tu tu pun macam mana aku macam</malay>
<malay>belajar</malay> [ah] the
the thrill of competition
<malay>macam lawan</malay>
<malay>sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk</malay> nationals
and then (uh)
gain my own confidence [lah]
primary [eh]
queenstown primary <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> queenstown secondary ya
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
<malay>asal dorang bagus</malay>
[oh] <malay>sebab aku rasa</malay>
okay <malay>aku</malay> remember primary five
(err) that was like the our best performance
for the senior team [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
against (err) since the first round <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> beat every school
(uh)
the west zone okay so <malay>kita</malay> east zone (err)
(uh) school <malay>ada</malay> east north (uh) west <malay>dengan</malay> south
<malay>jadi kita dari</malay> east zone
<malay>jadi kita</malay> meet all these different schools <malay>yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita</malay> beat them [ah]
(err) using basics <malay>kita tak ada macam</malay> fancy fancy <malay>semua tapi</malay> coach <malay>kita ajar macam betul-betul</malay> master your basics
(uh) and I also think that's important [lah] because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
<malay>kita</malay> beat all these schools from
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until (uh) finals
<malay>tak itu yang</malay>
(uh)
[oh]
east zone is #junyuan# primary
ya <malay>tapi aku</malay>
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
(uh) is #qihua# #qihua# primary
and
either #qihua# or #junyuan# [ah]
but
ya #junyuan# is the east zone
champions [ah] power house
but
surprisingly national that time primary five <malay>kita</malay> beat <malay>dorang juga</malay> #junyuan# ya so <malay>kita macam kita ada</malay> this momentum [ah] which starting <malay>sampai</malay> finals <malay>kita tak kalah</malay>
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like (err) even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like (uh)
personally I felt was possible [lah] but it it came down to my
my (uh) my team
that day first
first team
(uh) <malay>menang</malay> #qihua#
second team <malay>kalah</malay>
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> champions
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
so <malay>macam</malay> every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus <malay>ada nama ni semua</malay> but never #tampines# north primary school
that was so it was
I I lost [ah] it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
(uh) if
if (err) one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
(err) we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
[a'ah] [sia] <malay>aku nangis rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> really felt the responsibility [ah]
[eh] but ya
ya
<malay>sebab kita punya</malay> vice principal <malay>kat situ</malay>
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us [lah]
but the #tampines# north <malay>tak pernah</malay> achieve this kind of achievement
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
(uh)
it was a big accomplishment [lah]
but ya
okay
performance
wait delta league <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[oh] okay
okay
ya ya ya
think <malay>macam</malay>
is is a very big accomplishment [lah]
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay>
congratulate [lor]
<malay>abeh aku nampak</malay> that time <malay>kau</malay> post <malay>kat</malay> instagram <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang</malay> still <malay>cakap apa</malay> boys become last at least
which is demotivating [ah]
yup
yup
I think
<malay>dorang</malay> shouldn't <malay>macam</malay> just celebrate because you get at least fourth <malay>macam dorang</malay> should celebrate the change you know
[ah] that's why
no
!wah! <malay>takde</malay> love life [lah] okay <malay>tinggal macam</malay> four minutes
so
no
okay [lah] (uh) so
<malay>aku</malay> attached
ya together with someone
(uh)
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
<malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> through
(uh)
this overseas trip
<malay>dia pergi</malay> cambodia
(uh) it was a service learning trip [lah]
so
<malay>dia</malay>
okay so total sec two that time <malay>ada macam</malay>
seven class
so
she's from (err) two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
