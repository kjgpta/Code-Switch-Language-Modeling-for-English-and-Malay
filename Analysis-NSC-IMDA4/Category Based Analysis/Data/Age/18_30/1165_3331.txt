[oh] ya
ya ya ya I I also been watching Netflix [lah]
[oh] favourite [eh]
(um) there's a lot of #animes# I like to watch I I'm a anime fan [lah] so Netflix surprisingly <malay>dorang macam makin banyak</malay> anime <malay>dorang masuk-masukkan</malay> [kan] I was like !wah! quite quite amazed though <malay>sebab dulu</malay> Netflix there's not much anime
[oh] right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no [lah]
you still hype <malay>dia masih ada</malay> serious serious because right now (um) the movie just came out <malay>abeh macam</malay>
all all of us (uh) <malay>kita pergi tengok</malay> movie <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
there are some of our friends also <malay>dorang masih belum tengok</malay>
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
and also <malay>tak salah aku</malay> the season two <malay>pun belum keluar kalau kau belum</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau baru nak</malay> start the hype you still [ah] don't have to wait so long for the season two
but
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out <malay>sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu</malay> season two possibly <malay>dorang akan keluar</malay> like
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
ya Netflix it came out [ah] slow but it came out came out right april <malay>tak salah</malay> april twenty twenty that's when the hype <malay>betul-betul naik</malay> [ah] [sia] and <malay>apa</malay> everytime
like (uh) there's some <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that [ah] the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also (err) <malay>dia nya</malay> #manga# because normally #mangas# like <malay>macam</malay> for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach (uh) #naruto#
<malay>dorang punya</malay> like the amount of copies that they [kan]
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>tak salah aku</malay> one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay [lah] this is just a rough gauge all of them [ah] took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
<malay>untuk</malay> demon slayer for the #manga# <malay>aje</malay> [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> !wah! it's only four years [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> hundred and twenty million <malay>dah</malay>
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
with drums [ah] [ah] <malay>tapi pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] japanese [kan] <malay>kita melayu kita kita kompang</malay>
<malay>masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya</malay> [eh] <malay>asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
ya the like what they say [ah] <malay>apa</malay> actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how <malay>apa</malay> #gui# is [ah] as a person
but but
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia nya</malay> other than the anime
(um) <malay>apa</malay> soundtrack <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
because one thing about (uh) anything in general [ah] <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a show or something [kan]
it is more emotional <malay>kalau dia nya</malay> soundtrack is a very <malay>macam</malay> it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer <malay>sekarang</malay> the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa <malay>yang</malay> the opening
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
and <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
that it becomes like everyday object everyday [ah] actions are <malay>sampai</malay> they don't know [ah] they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but !wah! it's
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
for all the #animes# [ah] I watch <malay>semua ikut yang</malay> this <malay>dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang</malay>
<malay>macam aku rasa</malay> like one shot there's this thing called one shot #animes# <malay>dorang</malay> usually <malay>macam</malay> forty plus minutes <malay>abeh dah tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia macam</malay> a short a short film [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> but it the sometimes like
<malay>orang fikir</malay> like [oh] the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters [ah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> even like those thirty or ten minute films [kan] it leaves a very
(uh) everlasting mark in your in your memory <malay>macam tak boleh lupakan</malay> it's that good [ah] like the story storytelling even (uh) the soundtrack cause come on man [ah] without soundtrack anything will be boring [lah]
exactly cause that's why I I always [ah]
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
it's okay man it's okay <malay>aku nya</malay> A math <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bila entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> there's this kind of stigma [ah] whenever you go to school or like university [ah] in that case
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that <malay>macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh</malay>
[ah] I I shared this with my one of my friends [ah] <malay>dia pun tengah ambil</malay> university but I think is like I think ya so ya [ah] bro that [one] is just that's just one person [lah] don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
especially <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> coding <malay>atau</malay> math [kan] there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where <malay>macam</malay> [oh] wait what's going on I don't understand [sia] and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly <malay>atau atau</malay> secondary school [tau]
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like (mm) I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
(mm)
ya
<malay>sebab mak aku</malay> english teacher
(uh) ya ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
ya and also <malay>macam</malay> being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called (err) from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is !huh!
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood [lah] in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
<malay>macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ni</malay> like <malay>asal asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kecil hati</malay> exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like [eh] don't don't be so abrupt don't be so <malay>macam</malay> rude [ah] <malay>kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini</malay> [kan] the person who speak all those abrupt words or <malay>macam kasar</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] normal [lah] <malay>takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe]</malay> so I'll just continue with what I'm doing [ah]
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and and in okay [ah] in university especially
adapting and also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what's that word again (uh) you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my my school also cause (err) if I'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
<malay>abeh kalau</malay> your
<malay>dah macam</malay>
lesser than two point eight
then <malay>kau akan dapat</malay> suspension
suspension meaning
<malay>satu tahun kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau</malay> [ah] [eh] sorry
after one year then <malay>kau kena</malay> re-enroll
ya
(um) when you are in a academic warning <malay>punya ni</malay> [ah] ya
if you haven't get academic warning then <malay>asalkan</malay> your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save [lah]
[ah] ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay I
<malay>ada</malay> is that <malay>macam kau nya</malay> topic <malay>bukan</malay> topic <malay>apa</malay> module module is that module <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kau nak kena belajar pasal</malay> another language
like <malay>macam</malay> malay <malay>atau</malay> mandarin
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh] is it the same as <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau nak berbual melayu</malay>
<malay>ada benda kita nak kena</malay> reverse the structure of a of a word
!huh!
[oh]
ya
<malay>macam nak cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> english post office <malay>abeh melayu pejabat</malay> post <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay> reverse [ah] it's in that that way [ah] like <malay>buat orang macam</malay> confusing
but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
<malay>pejabat</malay> post
[oh] like <malay>apa</malay> dialects [ah] slang slang
(mm)
[oh] I
[ah]
(mm)
(um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>baru-baru punya</malay> module <malay>yang apa nak nak kena ajar</malay> like <malay>aku rasa</malay> for example like
(uh) in the market I guess one thing <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam banyak-banyak tukar</malay> is the job finding
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say (err) user experience [kan]
normally <malay>macam tak banyak kerja pasal</malay> user experience [mah] because it's not that known to be (uh) to be like a proper job <malay>orang fikir macam</malay> !alah! <malay>ni orang lain buat boleh buat</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> it's another job
on top of the job that <malay>orang tengah buat</malay> but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object <malay>macam kau pegang cawan</malay>
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right <malay>abeh kau imagine kalau</malay> they handle <malay>ada duri</malay> <malay>tak</malay> comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics (err) the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though <malay>macam</malay> it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
<malay>macam kau tengah</malay> bad mood <malay>abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa</malay>
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
like (err) happiness like for example <malay>kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja</malay>
<malay>dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] how am I gonna get to that level so <malay>kau kau</malay> (uh) <malay>bertungkus-lumus kau</malay> (uh) <malay>cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak</malay> and that process <malay>buat kau</malay> bad mood
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
some people <malay>dorang dah</malay> so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money <malay>walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih</malay>
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset <malay>macam</malay> [oh] since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
I I'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but I guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can [ah] achieve
like <malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] like he said in two years [eh]
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was (err) I okay [lah] when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
<malay>cam rezeki akan di diberikan</malay> like don't focus always on the <malay>rezeki</malay> focus on like
what make things work in in the last time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> retrospect [ah] but for now it's more like
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
which is why I appreciate like all those people <malay>yang</malay> even though it's just [ah] comic books or like anime [kan] it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya you have to take a break [ah]
that's why I feel
[ah] for this anime <malay>macam</malay> all these [one]
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
that's why like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] ya <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience [lah] the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
which is why I also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
!wow!
Marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
it's happening in in that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] alternate universe [lah] in a way [ah] ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is <malay>dorang</malay> they <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam</malay> the movie <malay>walaupun</malay> that movie <malay>ada banyak orang macam</malay> superpower [kan] <malay>tapi dorang buatkan</malay> character <malay>tu macam</malay> he goes through everyday life as per normal but (uh) they somehow <malay>macam</malay> in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though <malay>ada orang dorang tak ada</malay> [ah] superpower <malay>tapi</malay> a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something <malay>yang buatkan kau macam</malay> strongly
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
(uh huh) game of thrones [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
tell you about it like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam orang gemuk</malay> like they want to achieve being slim like have that [ah] that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like [eh] <malay>dah kurus</malay> [eh] [sia] <malay>baik [pe]</malay> but actually <malay>kau kau tak tahu</malay> like the process itself <malay>buatkan kau nak</malay> slim <malay>kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau dah kurus</malay> [kan]
you'll feel good [lah]
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal (uh) weight your optimal image <malay>tapi</malay> the
the thought of people <malay>macam dorang perasan</malay> like <malay>kau tengah berubah</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> you looking more slim or looking more [ah] toned your body looks so toned then <malay>kau</malay> you'll feel better and it helps to
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
<malay>tapi</malay> it's it's I guess this little happiness <malay>macam kalau nak</malay> go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness <malay>buat kau macam</malay> maintain your course cause <malay>ada orang</malay> let's say <malay>pasal yang</malay> language [one] <malay>aku pun tengah</malay> another language is called C sharp programming language
so that [one] (err) I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
for this different generations like <malay>sejak</malay> okay [ah] this past few hundred years [ah] there has been certain developments in (uh) certain parts of (uh) humanity like last time there's (uh) agriculture industrial evolution [kan] then there's (uh)
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay [lah] maybe
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if <malay>aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam</malay>
<malay>aku nak</malay> keep up to date to certain things <malay>jadi macam</malay> I'm not
(uh) losing in the race for finding jobs <malay>atau</malay> (uh) skill sets so
<malay>aku</malay> push myself [ah] I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes <malay>kalau kau buat benda sorang</malay> like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like [ah] if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya ya
especially if you okay [lah] probably <malay>yang buatkan kau malu</malay> is <malay>kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku</malay> assume that <malay>walaupun susah</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> I can just Google <malay>apa</malay> Google is there for me to help <malay>boleh</malay> search <malay>senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri</malay>
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
(uh) the the amid the Google search <malay>yang kau buat</malay>
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work <malay>kalau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau ikut</malay> [jer] it will definitely not work
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience <malay>macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam</malay> five <malay>dorang main ke</malay> I mean
for educational purpose
ya like okay <malay>kalau aku</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> aim for
<malay>apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar</malay> like <malay>tiga tahun empat tahun</malay> [ah] not not not not <malay>tak tahu belajar</malay> I mean <malay>tak tahu tak tahu buat</malay> math like <malay>aku bagi dorang</malay> game <malay>pasal</malay> math <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nya macam</malay> quizzes <malay>aku bagi</malay> chemistry
<malay>lari</malay> [kan] that's why (err) that target audience is the most important thing when <malay>kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam untuk kau</malay> [eh] best [sia] game <malay>ni ada</malay> chemistry <malay>tapi kau tak tahu</malay> actually your audience is <malay>yang orang yang nak belajar pasal</malay> math
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
like iron man okay <malay>ni ni ni betul-betul</malay> (uh) off track
[ah] ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart [lah] like he might be one of the inspiration where <malay>aku</malay> will continue programming because
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
scenario <malay>kalau orang betul-betul</malay> don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so <malay>aku rasa</malay> like programming is a
it's a good it's a
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth [sia]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
I mean they will have a controlled environment <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia nya apa tu</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam</malay> this sphere <malay>abeh kalau ada ikut macam</malay> earth <malay>punya udara</malay> inside that sphere <malay>aku rasa</malay> everything should be fine <malay>kalau orang kena tanam ke apa</malay> there might be a proper grave for them <malay>cuma</malay>
it's weird [lah] it it's weird [ah] cause <malay>tak pernah dengar orang</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>mana kubur kau bukan kau</malay> [ah] <malay>mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa</malay> [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> mars [ah] <malay>aku nak merawat</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> spaceship but that is a possible future also like <malay>kalau</malay> let's say when elon musk <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you have your own spaceship <malay>macam kereta sekarang</malay> but <malay>kau nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [ah] moon <malay>jap kau nak makan</malay> [ah] moon burger [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita gi makan sekarang</malay> K <malay>jap aku ambil</malay> spaceship <malay>aku</malay>
ya <malay>abeh kau</malay> [ah] fly [ah] okay [ah] <malay>ni</malay> set [ah] to moon then <malay>dia nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau cakap</malay> okay (uh) ten minutes ride okay
<malay>abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang</malay> Grab [pe] so <malay>kau</malay> call (uh) space Grab
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
unless <malay>bila</malay> mars <malay>dah ada</malay> a way to like
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya
maybe the thought of that like <malay>macam aku tahu aku tak mati</malay> so <malay>buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua</malay> you become complacent
then <malay>kau</malay> complacent then then there's no progress in life [lah] <malay>macam semua dah</malay> convenient <malay>untuk kau [pe]</malay> or <malay>aku boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku boleh tengok</malay> anime <malay>hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati</malay> [pe] so <malay>takyah belajar</malay> [ah] <malay>takyah belajar apa takyah mandi</malay> cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
I will still stay young [what] I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
makes humanity not to deserve to have a (um) <malay>apa</malay> eternal life
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
but not the things like <malay>macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni bagus</malay> [sia] okay <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> for example <malay>kalau</malay> michael jackson
<malay>dia buat buat lagu semua macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia tak mati</malay> it's still there [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] a legend it has it is a legend because
(err) people who die I don't know [ah] this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
so imagine if like [ah] the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] wrestling or any any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
the same goes for <malay>ni</malay> [ah] the the the football legend
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya ya
it's like it heightens your
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ada buat aku susah</malay> but
[ah] I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he (uh) that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film [eh] or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
[ah]
exactly
which is why I like anime
ya so okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> time [ah] <malay>ni tak banyak</malay> time sorry
stop [lah] am I at taiwan taiwan at times already [ah] okay [lah] hello [ah] actually [ah] K bye
