okay then (err) let's see if (err) they are they are married already then after that (um) they they are not stable
okay so it's like (err) <malay>kes macam</malay> (err) okay scenario [ah] it's like (err)
both of them after O-levels maybe they don't want to work anymore I mean they don't want to school anymore so they took part time job then they feel like (oo) got so so much opportunity in this part time jobs so they want to grow from those part time jobs
[ah] but they're not stable yet [ah] like they still ya like don't have any plans yet for the future but they know they want to get married
like papers in papers like at eighteen I want to get married now

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya he's the one that kind of thing [ah]
ya ya ya ya
true ya
ya
and you're already married anyway [kan]
[ah]
true
okay then it brings me to the next question
(uh) if let's say like (err) you you get into a relationship already [ah] then the guy is like I want to take it to the next level but you you're in a fresh relationship you know
what okay so
the the major question is like how long do you think is a good time until you should move on to the next step in life
ya time
[ah]
okay okay
(mm)
okay
play around you
<malay>macam apa</malay> (mm) <malay>macam nak</malay> date other chicks or what
(mm)
!huh!
they call it off for eight years' [oh]
eight years [oh] my the fact that you actually drop so easily [ah] the eight years
[ah]
[ah]
interesting ya
!aiya!
ease [sia]
I think I think by the fourth year [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> settle down [sia] <malay>aku dah macam</malay> damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me [ah] by the third or fourth year [ah] it will give me like a sense of <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] I like I want to to settle down tie a knot you know start the family planning you know like
start my future [lah] you know
<malay>baik</malay>
yes [sia]
(oo) !wah!
(mm)
true true okay [ah]
okay we are
next year is our third year [ah]
(mm)
<malay>boleh juga</malay>
[ah] that's the thing [lah] because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling <malay>abeh tak</malay> stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot <malay>kita masih takde</malay>
like <malay>tak</malay> ready because of money ya
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
true true
<malay>tapi</malay> honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like (err)
they don't want both of us to <malay>macam sekolah</malay> halfway <malay>sekolah</malay> halfway then after that (err) drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support [ah] to support each other or like (err)
that's basic adult things [ah] adult marriage things you know ya like [oh] we have to save money to buy house you know that kind of thing
so I think that's what both our parents are looking at [ah]
but ya [lah] like what you say [ah] it can be on papers you know so that is not a sin for us to be together
(mm)
(mm)
true
I to me I ya I see it from that point of you [ah] to me [ah] because honestly being this old
I don't want to commit anymore sins [eh] and it's not that (err) <malay>macam bukan aku yang tanggung</malay> fully [tau] is like my parents around who has to <malay>tanggung</malay> for my sins also so it's like !aiya! I don't know [lah] <malay>susah</malay> I don't mind getting married now
but it's just that like you know older generation thinking I guess I don't know
but ya what do you think
true
ya [sia] actually true and it's workaholics
<malay>macam</malay> I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
(err) friends yang <malay>macam</malay> [ah] don't want [ah] I I need money I need money like (err) <malay>aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup</malay> and I'm like but money is not everything [what] you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know [ah] <malay>macam entah</malay>
I mean people different (err) different mindset [lah] [ah]
(mm)
it's true [oh] my god that [one] that [one] is a major issue in singapore [sia] like money is such
money just plays a big part [eh] in singapore
<malay>macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] I mean
okay #ang moh# (err)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
true ya ya ya okay [lah] it is
actually (err) okay when I was in [kan] everything there was so slow
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal <malay>tak takde orang yang macam marah marah</malay> you know <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>semua orang nak</malay> boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport <malay>semua orang macam</malay> [oh] !alamak! <malay>aku kena masuk</malay>
like I have to get in if not cannot [sia] late for (err) late for work you know that kind of thing
[ah]
<malay>entah</malay> when I was still
[ah]
correct [eh] okay [lah] jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small <malay>ambil macam</malay> the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular <malay>apa</malay> the population [ah] yes is so dense and like there's this
a lot of people coming in [ah] and I I feel like it's not stopping you see true I think a lot of people ya
actually a lot of people want to (err) <malay>masuk</malay> singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and <malay>kita macam</malay> number one [tau] tip top [tau]
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that <malay>bila</malay> spain <malay>kena dia cepat cepat balik ke</malay> singapore
ya dead rich but the point is like
(err) very late very like (um) she said that
singapore's (err) healthcare is the best
<malay>macam kalau kau sakit ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> disease <malay>siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang</malay> singapore singapore can like handle it you know
because singapore puts there are healthcare like one of the priorities of the country so I feel like (err) singapore is number one [lah] for healthcare
ya like a lot of people come to singapore like I saw a lot of people okay there's this [ah]
web for (err) what's that called
donation like that okay and then like (err) a lot of children from asia kind of thing <malay>dorang macam</malay> (err)
they come to singapore to get treatments ya so like (err) this [one] is cancer so they quickly come to singapore to get a treatment for cancer this [one] got tumour so you come to singapore do all this
and then another [one] is ya no [lah] I mean it's not that they do it but a lot people want to come to singapore to get that treatments because it's reliable
then (um) I don't know [lah] a lot of people just come to singapore just for healthcare
ya
no [oh] my god you know healthcare is so bad [lah]
is so bad
[ah] [ah] [ah]
I okay come on [lah] singapore is
(err) accessible okay like
got clinic here hospital is nearby in every (err) town area and then that kind of thing [ah] correct but in if you live in the suburbs it's so hard to get to the hospital it's probably like one hour drive away
twenty minutes away thirty minute away that kind of thing
suburbs
suburbs is like farm area <malay>macam</malay> all the rural [ah] [ah] [ah] like rural area like people
who have a lot of land then they do like farming you know that kind of thing ya so it's those like with big plotted lands [lah] it's not necessarily like they are not rich
but it's just that they have a lot of land and they want to do a lot of things like farming you know that all that kind of thing that we cannot do in singapore [lah] basically
so ya there are okay [lah] as
they do have the land that's all that is the good thing about they have land to do a lot of things but then sometimes they don't take
ya they don't take advantage of what they've been given [lah]
so
!oof!
ya [hor]
I believe singapore because like singapore I usually like if any land any
<malay>betul</malay>
I remember <malay>dekat</malay> #punggol# <malay>macam</malay> everything must empty <malay>takde barang</malay> you know there was a a lot of land <malay>yang kita boleh pakai</malay>
and then <malay>kita macam</malay>
you know last time I (err) we go <malay>pancing</malay> [tau]
<malay>pancing dekat macam</malay> illegal places
[eh] <malay>aku pancing</malay> [lah]
<malay>dekat macam</malay>
(err) how to say [ah] <malay>macam hutan-hutan</malay> [oh] <malay>begitu kita pergi kita</malay> drive <malay>dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah</malay> random
serious <malay>tak</malay> joke <malay>ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni</malay> confirm <malay>dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik</malay> confirm <malay>tahu punya</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
so (err) I think <malay>kita pancing</malay> [ah] but then after that I think the government know about it [lah] so no choice right (err) they I think they close <malay>macam</malay> a lot of the places [ah] and then (err) <malay>kita</malay> the only place <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> is
#bedok# jetty #changi# you know ya
so I guess this I understand [lah] why the government is building all this
flats because population <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>makin besar</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [ah] foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then (err) <malay>apa</malay> singapore <malay>pun</malay> is a district for business [tau] <malay>kau tahu</malay> like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>si</malay> #kim jong-un# <malay>datang kat</malay> singapore <malay>dengan si</malay> donald <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang datang ke sini</malay> cause we are neutral
[ah] we are we are not an enemy to anybody
[ah] <malay>aku ingat aku ingat</malay> the <malay>apa banyak macam sibuk kat</malay> shangri-la <malay>tapi semua orang macam</malay> !ee! I want to see #liao# [ah] that kind of thing
to me it was like
[eh] singapore <malay>ambil kesempatan</malay> [eh] but it's good (err) <malay>apanya rasa</malay> publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya <malay>sebab</malay> !wah! <malay>terus semua orang macam</malay> !wah! <malay>tengok</malay> !oi! singapore <malay>lawanya</malay> shangri-la !wah! <malay>macam semua nak pergi</malay> [kan]
true ya
that's true that's right
<malay>tapi</malay> (err) I (err) <malay>aku rasa</malay> <malay>ramai orang ada</malay> misconception especially after rich crazy <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] that [one] that movie

so they have more people [lah] actually but it's just that it's very little like (uh) one each
but it's extra work
you know it's extra work
even at Timezone <malay>tu kali aku pergi</malay>
ya <malay>aku pergi</malay> Timezone
[eh] Timezone <malay>bes</malay> [seh] but anyway I went to Timezone also

that hundred dollars that you know when the ya I'm always up to date okay I
ya I'm always up to date okay I love Timezone and I got so many points
ya
but then
(uh) same [lah] like they just <malay>kesian aku tengok</malay> a lot of people do a lot work [seh] then <malay>macam</malay> to me it's extra work [ah]
ya speaking of that
did you see the one of the ministers suggests that singaporeans like they if they want they they can take second jobs [seh]
!aiyo! is not the east coast [lah] #laila# [ah]
<malay>macam mana</malay>
!oof! <malay>kenapa pula</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true
[ah] ya
#ish# !woo! !woo! !woo! chill
ya [sia]
ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but if okay [lah] let's say if (err)
even if we were to take this second job right how to okay for example we take you as an example no we take you as an example okay you work six days a week you know
where can you find time to slot in the second jobs [sia]

ya [lah]
(mm)
true and also if you could get you in trouble [seh]
right
(mm)
ya [sia] [eh] speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught <malay>lagi</malay> like
like
then you just getting yourself into trouble [seh]
but ya [lah] I I think you brought up a good point [seh] like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle <malay>yang tak</malay> take so much of your time [ah] then maybe can [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] home based [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
true
but then this second job doesn't have
right
ya
<malay>macam</malay> what
like there are I I guess got good and bad [lah] like to do this okay the good is ya more income [lah]
true
as in what
(mm)
(mm)
ya that is if you have a family
