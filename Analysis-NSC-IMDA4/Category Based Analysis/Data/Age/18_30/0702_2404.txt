about one month

<malay>duduk kat rumah</malay> and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
that's why I <malay>tadi</malay> I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
that is me in the office <malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> I will just like <malay>duduk depan depan</malay> then my laptop

effective ya
(mm) it's not at all also
<malay>ya ke</malay>
[oh] my god and the
and he he is used to that

[oh] then what your wifi around your houses [eh] around your houses around the house <malay>macam</malay> good [ah]
(mm)
and your room

like because your work from home <malay>pakai</malay> <malay>pakai pakai apa</malay> Microsoft or
or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out [meh] <malay>macam</malay> never lag or what
[orh]
(mm) okay so the experience is quite
okay [lah] for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
ya so now <malay>buat apa</malay>
back to school already right
[oh]
[oh] one more month !wow!
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
!wow! you got
two months of holiday [ah] not bad [ah] you
(mm)
[oh] you've been working part time <malay>kerja apa</malay> [eh] cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
(uh huh)
like what
why
but you are still working [what] okay [lah] <malay>tu</malay> means you [dah] survive <malay>sikit</malay>
spent too much on what
[oh] how much you earn [ah] that that that job
(mm)
hundred per
[oh]
ninety nine
per night
!wow!
okay
<malay>kerja apa</malay> why you never explain
[oh] pack <malay>apa</malay>
makeup stuff
then you work alone or what not alone right <malay>ada orang lain juga</malay> [kan]
[orh]
<malay>kerja kat mana kat</malay> warehouse [eh]
#Tampines#
!huh! then how you travel [seh]
<malay>ibu cik nya rumah</malay>
#Yishun# correct [orh] so you got straight bus there [lah]
technically [lah] a bit [lah]
<malay>lama</malay>
compared to staying at [ah] compared to where you are now until
(uh) at <malay>ibu cik</malay> house [lah] the difference right
(mm) okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience [what] you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
one week and then you cannot <malay>tahan</malay>
(uh)
it's just too fast paced [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
ya one day <malay>berapa</malay>
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K [lah]
(mm)
!wow! not bad [ah] you
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
(uh) the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the in the emtire human line
if you are at the first first person [ah] then <malay>paling senang</malay>
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up [what]
[ah] [kan] so if you are the first person it's the easiest job [ah] but quality check a bit hard [ah]
quality check and need to <malay>buat cepat cepat</malay> then that's crazy [ah]
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
<malay>macam</malay> from
(err) we start at about nine [kan] then we need to
pack for [eh] no we start at about [oh] <malay>macam lapan setengah</malay> then <malay>lapan setengah</malay> all the way until <malay>pukul dua belas</malay>
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the [ah] the rice is either you
(uh) scoop the <malay>kuah</malay> then after that you #kiap# the container then you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target [lah] but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
[ah] pack <malay>kat</malay> kitchen [ah] so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because <malay>panas</malay> [lah] then when you #kiap# the container then you also will #kiap# your finger [lah]
bla bla [lah] then lepas <malay>balik</malay>
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person [ah] so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
<malay>kat mana kat</malay>
the industrial area at #Woodlands# there [lah]
(mm) so they needed manpower (uh) so they asked manpower from my company so so ya [lor]
(mm)
yup my current company [lah] so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
I mean the the packing place <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>kerja</malay> is (um)
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them [lah] (mm)
(mm)
ya [lor] so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand [lah] what it means when you say fast paced
express <malay>gila</malay> [lah] especially when you do quality check how to quality check <malay>cepat cepat</malay> [seh]
so that's how tired you are then now <malay>kerja apa</malay> [seh] <malay>kerja malam</malay>
[oh]

nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can [lah]
no [ah] you will learn [one] usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
like few months ago <malay>sekarang baru dia dapat</malay>

(mm) !ee! I ask you first how's you and Andy
you've been closer right every time <malay>sekarang</malay> I always saw you and
you and Andy on InstaStory
that's why <malay>selalu macam</malay> spend time <malay>sama sama</malay>
<malay>dia pun</malay> holiday <malay>ke</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay okay
[oh]
that's why you guys spend time together
(mm)
ya that's why that's why <malay>macam selalu</malay> when I see your InstaStory <malay>macam</malay> [eh]
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
<malay>kenapa</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> [seh]
[oh] I mean
[oh] <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mata merah</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
like jealous <malay>ke</malay> like [oh] I have a boyfriend but you don't like (err)
[oh]
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy <malay>faham</malay> [lah] that's the thing
understand each other
meet <malay>tapi masih berbual</malay> [kan]
like on Whatsapp or at least <malay>berbual</malay> on the phone
good [lah] good [lah]
(mm)
not talk
(mm)
well good [lah] good [lah] at least
in in this relationship the two of you
<malay>kau orang dua faham</malay> each other the needs and the the wants
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
<malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
ya how long already [ah]
what
three years
not bad [ah] three years [ah] this is this the longest
(mm)
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay [lah] actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya [lah] because his side he don't make it he don't
show it <malay>dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan</malay> so
(uh) his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya (mm)
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like !hais! [eh] cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is <malay>macam</malay>
(err) me and him are dealing shitty stuff now [lah] so ya
together and individually so <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] let's say [ah] so [ah] cause <malay>sekarang dia</malay> [dah] right
do you know what he's working now
(mm) you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram [ah]
[oh]
[oh] that recent stories <malay>dia tak</malay> appear [lah] that kind of thing okay okay
cause [ah] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> work as financial adviser
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but (uh) under there's a sister company called
so (err) basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
(mm) so okay [lah]
(uh) you ask me <malay>kenapa dia kerja ni pasal</malay> one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and <malay>dia dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer]
[ah] so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
so <malay>sekarang dia boleh</malay> go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
(mm) so that is his career so his career now [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people [kan]
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages (uh) different character
(uh) gender and everything else so <malay>macam</malay>
okay [lah] I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so (um)
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
<malay>kita</malay> is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
fourth year in the relationship
ya ya so [ah] so <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh]
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his <malay>pun pernah</malay> happen I don't know [eh]
so <malay>macam</malay> this thing happen for the third time already
okay so okay [ah] now I explain to you what happen
so (uh) basically <malay>dia dia bilang</malay> me Hans <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya orang</malay> is <malay>dia</malay> he's very honest
so <malay>dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa</malay> his <malay>perasaan</malay> everything to me
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me [ah] [oh] (um)
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
so at first <malay>bila dia cakap macam gitu</malay> I thought
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like (uh) means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
<malay>tapi</malay> it's not explore means <malay>dia nak</malay> explore <malay>dia nak jumpa orang baru</malay> without feeling (err) bad
get it so means [ah] means [ah] like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about #Lina# that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
his <malay>dia ada</malay> group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
[ah] so that is the first time it happened
so when he met new group of girls then <malay>tiba tiba dia macam</malay>
!wow! <malay>macam</malay> okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay [lah] <malay>sakit hati tu sakit hati</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> at least
[ah] it
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so <malay>macam</malay> okay first time let it go that kind of thing
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
ya but that someone that lady <malay>dia macam</malay>
not interested [lah] because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is (err) volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
[ah]
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional (uh) breakdown [ah] I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
<malay>dia macam sampai berbual</malay> on <malay>dia macam</malay> my no [ah] like
<malay>memang dia</malay> they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp [lah] like
like made a move [lah] <malay>macam</malay> message [lah] message the <malay>perempuan nak nak</malay> know better
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating [lah] but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct [a'ah]
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
<malay>kelakar</malay> [kan]
[kan] (uh)
ya
this is what I'm trying to say [lah] don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
it's just <malay>dia punya tiba tiba</malay> the way <malay>dia layan</malay> me the way he he behave around me change
<malay>macam</malay> in terms of not good [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> he he he he tell me things like (err) I want to explore he don't want to feel
like limited talking to new people
get it because in this in <malay>dia punya</malay> line of job <malay>dia akan jumpa</malay>
<malay>jumpa orang baru</malay>
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] ya [lah] professional that part it is [lah] but at the same time <malay>dia nak</malay>
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is (um)
(err) way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say [ah] this is me [ah] this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
at any point of time in his life <malay>dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang</malay> better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing <malay>tu juga</malay> I said <malay>macam</malay> I I say to him [ah] I also can say the same thing to you [what] but I choose to focus what is in front of me
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
<malay>faham tak</malay>
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit [lah]
so ya !hais!
no I don't know because
from the start of the relationship I got even I <malay>pernah bilang</malay> you [what] <malay>bila kita nak</malay>
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up (uh) like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me [ah] if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya [lah]
like that's why when you things like (uh) on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
[ah] I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know [lah]
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] I mean you <malay>nak</malay> comment <malay>pun</malay> comment [lah] because honestly
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
ya and there's no there's no end to it <malay>macam</malay> there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion <malay>macam</malay> do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so <malay>macam</malay>
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
<malay>macam</malay> okay
<malay>macam</malay> dependent [lah]
not exactly [lah]
<malay>bukan macam</malay> okay so
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
ya [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
it's stupid [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
(mm)
(mm)
but you you do try to recover after that right
(mmhmm)
(mm) [ah] that's the word make up
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay> [lah]
ya [lah]
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
[kan]
<malay>dia belum</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay> [lah] but at least now <malay>kau orang</malay> at least <malay>ada ada</malay> so called same goal in the relationship right
(mm) (mm)
with him
(mm) at least at least a goal with him [kan]
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
get it <malay>macam</malay>
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like (err) am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
for me now with Han is really <malay>macam</malay>
a total switch a total change of goals which is now <malay>tak</malay> match
ya so now I'm just like
(uh) like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I don't know [lah] I really don't know I don't know whether <malay>kita</malay> are compatible or what already [lah] because <malay>dia memang</malay> [dah] ada</malay> other mindset <malay>juga</malay>
I
met his parents
spend time yes <malay>tapi macam</malay> other stuff to talk about the future no [lah] because <malay>dia punya</malay> parents obviously is supportive of Hans
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
like a like a person like like a <malay>gundu</malay> like that <malay>tunggu macam macam</malay>
<malay>macam badut gitu</malay> but the (uh)
!haiya! ya [lah] the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
it has been weeks already [ah] so if I cry now also <malay>macam</malay>
it's just tears [eh] <malay>macam</malay> really legit [sia] so <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah]
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so <malay>kalau</malay> we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand [lah]
<malay>tak apa</malay> (uh) it's okay not to make assumption [ah] but
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
<malay>kalau kita</malay> so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
(mm) [eh]
like
[kan] [kan] so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
(mm)
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then <malay>dia macam</malay> disagree [ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(uh) (hmm) no he I don't know <malay>dia cakap</malay> (um) why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just (um) be friends
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so <malay>macam</malay>
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out <malay>macam gitu</malay> (mm)
so far so far during this period right
where (uh) like
I (mm) only just now I met him [lah] after like a week <malay>tak jumpa</malay>
but few days ago when my friend <malay>ajak</malay> me hang out then I asked <malay>ada siapa</malay> <malay>kalau ada</malay> Hans I say to them I <malay>tak nak</malay> join
(mm)
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story [lah] okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware [sia]
(err) like I don't know a week ago maybe
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> ya <malay>ini susah</malay> [ah] <malay>susah</malay>
he's
I know I understand
!hais!
!hais!
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only [lah] I hint to my mother only [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
she she sense it [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to (uh)
the group of friends <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>bilang pun macam</malay>
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya [loh]
so this issue <malay>macam</malay> I really <malay>tak nak bilang orang</malay> but
on my Instagram I think people can like [oh] okay Hans and #Lina# is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
(mm)
ya <malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think <malay>pasal</malay> I'm just too <malay>macam</malay>
too
I have fallen for him too hard that (uh) now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two <malay>masih boleh jumpa orang lain</malay> and stuff <malay>tapi</malay>
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person [lah] but
ya [ah] so ya [dah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
[ah] it's just me expressing my emotions
(mm) and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
!huh!
ya it affect
<malay>kadang kadang</malay> [seh] <malay>dalam kerja</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out [ah]
then suddenly <malay>benda tu</malay> come in
then when <malay>benda tu</malay> come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when <malay>tadi</malay> you <malay>bilang</malay> me [kan] [ah] what time you sleep and stuff right
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
twelve <malay>tahu</malay>
sometimes I <malay>habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I'll just hang out talk I just like (err) but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I <malay>baru balik</malay> that kind of thing then once I go home
I'll just knockout [ah] so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing [lah]
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
<malay>tidur pukul tiga bangun pukul lapan</malay>
then
then it affected my work in terms of productivity [lah] I <malay>lupa benda</malay> I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so (um)
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already [lah] so that is good enough
(hmm) ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand [lah]
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
[ah] your <malay>rumah macam tukar hari hari</malay> [seh]
ya ya ya ya
then before <malay>raya</malay> I think I went to your house once also different theme then <malay>raya</malay> also different theme
then <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy [seh]
it's only your room <malay>tak</malay> involved [lah]
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space [seh] that is good that's what I need [eh]
but the thing is I don't like to work in my <malay>bilik pasal</malay> wifi <malay>tak</malay> strong legit <malay>tak</malay> strong
ya (mm) me me and my <malay>adik</malay> already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
we just need a different type of (um) router ya
because this wifi sucks you okay for example [ah] <malay>kalau sekarang</malay> you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
ya
[kan] that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
I always do outside <malay>kalau tak</malay> I'll just do at other places
(mm)
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
so <malay>macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi</malay> to my room
how many wifi you have at home
[oh] you have two
one is at
(mm) so you are connected to your
parents' [one]
(mm) <malay>patutlah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> ya then I need to <malay>pasang</malay> one more [loh]
(mm)
ya
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] but
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
(mm)
just now <malay>punya</malay> meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy [kan] no it's <malay>macam gini</malay> so you <malay>kerja macam biasa</malay>

ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now [ah]
(err)
I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one (err) some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
they also have still to do they still need to do their <malay>kerja kerja biasa</malay>
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
(mm)
that is why at night we need to do meeting <malay>pasal</malay> everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
[ah]
