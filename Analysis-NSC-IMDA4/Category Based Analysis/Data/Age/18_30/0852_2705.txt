[eh] <malay>rabak</malay> army life is the most
especially during
<malay>susah susah gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay>
you will your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm [ah]
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] no hair <malay>botak</malay>
so ya and then like
okay [lah] they teach you a lot about like
[ah] regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
and then like there's <malay>sikit sikit kena tekan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
it's miserable [lah] everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
[ah] that's what I used to think [lah] because
when I when I became a recruit at #tekong# I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life [ah]
but honestly when
I got posted out <malay>tukar</malay> vocation
into inventory
is basically [ah]
on steroids [ah] is like <malay>lagi susah</malay>
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like times ten [ah]
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then like <malay>buka</malay> civilian clothes
and then you are treated nicely [what]
[eh] <malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
no no
when I went to #kranji# camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
like <malay>penat</malay> [ah]
<malay>susah gila</malay>
is like
even even though you are treated fairly [ah] but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
[ah] basically you are treated like
like less than human [ah]
<malay>macam macam sampah masyarakat</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> you are treated like that bad
then
and then <malay>sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>asyik maki</malay> <malay>kena kena tekan</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>sekarang pun masih kena tekan</malay>
but not as often
ya way better [ah] but
I even though is hard right
is the I think once I right
I will really miss it [ah] all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
<malay>habis boleh boleh hidup</malay> [ah]
like I managed to go through it

ya ya ya but youtube you can find what you want to find <malay>itu yang bagus dia</malay>
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about (err)
like photography and photoshop
so basically (err) after I
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right
basically I want to start a new instagram <malay>punya</malay> account [ah]
(err) like
really like edit pictures really well photography like
quality studio near
quality [ah]
so it's like I get like followers [ah]
(err) it's like honestly [eh]
<malay>tak tahu asal</malay> [lah] but like instagram more revealing is is quite a thing [ah] people like really follow they find inspiration from it and
what I heard from my member as !duh!
<malay>dia</malay> got his client's straight from instagram
like they asked for mister grab even though <malay>dia tak</malay>
come forward to tell like [eh] I'm training people people approach him so what if right you you're the person that give your service
and then ya can you imagine
no ya it's a good idea and then
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>tahu</malay> that that photoshop <malay>punya</malay> skills <malay>semua</malay> [kan] photography skill [kan] I can use to to take [ah] couple photos with my girlfriend
and <malay>pandai</malay> [kan]
ya ya
instagram is <malay>apa</malay> famous
ya is like very popular
okay and then <malay>tiba</malay> your news feed is like filled with
fitness <malay>punya benda</malay> [eh]
gym shark
(hmm) (mm)
ya [lah] yoga pants [lah] (oo) what [lah] shaker bottle
supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
outliers <malay>macam</malay> #jujimufu#
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and !hey! bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different [ah]
ya
ya
that's why I want to buy a soft box
you know those [ah]
<malay>yang</malay> photographer <malay>pakai</malay> [lah]
the basically like a umbrella and then there is a light bulb inside
and then the light bulb like really shines like
at the subject <malay>punya nak ambil gambar tu</malay> and then when you raise your hand to block the light [kan] <malay>dia tak ada macam</malay> harsh shadows when you cover your hand <malay>nanti</malay> the the shadow is like very soft
so is like photography level <malay>punya</malay> lighting is like one on top <malay>satu dekat atas satu dekat belakang</malay>
ya so <malay>nak yang tu yang dekat belakang tu</malay> highlight so like you will highlight your back
and then like so it's look like really good [ah] that's why I also want to buy new phone
[eh] S twenty is good [ah]
[oh] no to me
technology now [kan]
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
and then need to buy memory card <malay>lagi susah leceh</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [ah]
so technology right now is like
is good [ah] how is progressing [ah]
ya ya (mm) S twenty plus [ah]
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
<malay>pasal</malay>
S twenty ultra <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone [ah] I bet you like taking photos right
(mm)
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
try to get a phone camera <malay>yang ada</malay> sixty frames per second
no just ask them any camera phones that
<malay>yang boleh</malay> record in sixty frames per second
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio
if it's both good they're willing to stay
most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game [ah]
right when you think about it you need to up your game also like
what like your camera quality [lah]
ya
stuck <malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
(um) (mm)
okay
okay [eh] but if you plan to upgrade your phone right
then what type of phone do you want

and then like your class so near and then !yay! recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life [lah]
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in
but back in poly [ah] it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time [lah] outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something [lah]
that I can
work [lah] but
honestly I don't want to [ah] I don't want to be electrical engineer
[eh] in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold #schwarzenegger# at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
!wah!
like <malay>kerja sekarang macam</malay>
there's a lot of foreign talent
I want to be a person [kan] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> very outs outs outstanding <malay>kira</malay> [kan]
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
(um) ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end wins right
(um)
P P
P P <malay>entah</malay> [lah] ya
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
not banner the advertisement <malay>dalam</malay> train
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
(mm)
is it like your your challenging the students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school [eh] let's say for example most everyone went to and they know what is taught there
but but your is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs
sorry my mistakes
okay
(um) ya
singapore is quite messed up [ah]
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
<malay>orang tua tua</malay>
okay from another country <malay>dengan</malay> singapore
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
you see [ah]
we progress so fast okay let's say <malay>orang tua sekarang nak pakai</malay> smartphones <malay>pun susah</malay>
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like
<malay>tak tak ramai orang perasan</malay> [ah] but ya
(um)
ya ya
but okay [lah] what
I think like
(um) this this time we're so lucky to be like born in the right time <malay>pasal</malay>
the next generation you won't feel so far
hopefully
