okay
okay ya
we're good
alright [eh] <malay> macam [eh] [eh] okay [ah]
okay [ah] <malay> boleh boleh no problem
[ah] [eh] [eh]
[eh] bro school is [eh] I hate school
school can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay (uh) #rabak# <malay> gila okay you imagine [eh] okay <malay> kau kau just imagined
<malay> aku I got I got like one (uh) one website
okay [eh] I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules [lah]
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay [ah] then I got one website for my
(uh) module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
okay one other website for this one <malay> punya module <malay> macam Q&A
in total [kan] <malay> kau tahu in total <malay> aku ada berapa banyak website
<malay> aku ada like around nine websites <malay> tahu in total and this is just week four
apa #lanchiau# [ah] <malay> aku tanya engkau apasal [lah]
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites [kan] is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like you know you know
amongst the students [lah]
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like [eh] this one how this [one] how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that [lah] to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like (um) there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions [ah]
like [oh] this [one] how <malay> padahal this [one] is everyone know <malay> semua orang tahu ini benda
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota [lah]
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat [lah] having a lecture or having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
<malay> kau tak boleh actually learn everything in one shot
<malay> kau tak boleh ask your on the left on the right
<malay> kau tak boleh
ask even the professor [lah]
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively [what]
so <malay> aku just <malay> bingit gila having this online lesson actually <malay> aku tak kisah tahu pasal COVID
<malay> tapi ever since this <malay> aku masuk [eh] !wah! !wow! <malay> aku bilang kau #rabak# <malay> gila
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday [sia] just to do work
#rabak# <malay> gila [ah]
#rabak# <malay> gila [ah] ya [sia] #rabak# <malay> gila I tell you
(mmhmm) ya
ya
but
[ah] [sia] seriously as I (err) I didn't know uni is so bad that it's legit just <malay> kau pandai pandai [ah]
<malay> kau imagine like on the first week
not not on the first week [lah] like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example [ah] python (err) you there's this [one]
[ah] ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input [ah] input format [lah]
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
<malay> aku pun tak tahu [ah] ya ya some
it's it's just so bad [ah] like and then
I don't know like even the other day
(err) I have this other module okay
[ah] it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics [lah]
okay so <malay> aku kena
I I got some friends [lah] I got some friends here and there
and then after that they because <malay> aku from engineering background <malay> apa
right so <malay> dia orang pernah tanya aku [ah] [eh] #koi# can teach me or not this this this okay [ah] <malay> boleh aku ajar engkau [ah]
then the other day I I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
[ah] like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad [lah] because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things [eh]
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say Singapore university of self study [eh]
okay like that's what people say [lah] my friend also say that he's in
and then after that I'm like okay [lah] maybe is terrible [lah]
but then when I come to I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
they just <malay> macam [ah] okay [ah] <malay> kau buat gini [ah] okay <malay> kau tahu bagus kau tak tahu [ah] <malay> kau belajar [ah] Google [ah]
<malay> apasal like
I don't know [ah] to me it's it's it's just nonsense [ah]
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two
(err) asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
[sia] [lah] poly <malay> mana ada aku stay up <malay> sampai pukul dua pagi [sia] <malay> buat kerja
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up [ah] just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy [lah] honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent [lah]
(err) I mean I mean we're okay because when you hear like I <malay> aku tak tahu kalau kau ada dengar tak
<malay> tapi aku ada dengar that (um)
this type of high
(um) really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother [one] [ah]
they really not brother [one] but but right at least it's they quite brother [lah] because
(err) and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] irfan</P1> your age [lah] but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty [eh]
ya I [eh]
ya ya (uh) everyone there is from like or from poly
wait [eh] hang on [eh]
ya [ah]
<malay> apa dia [ah] <malay> cakap cakap cakap [jer]
[ah] okay
but
[oh] part time uni
(err) (um)
[oh] honestly the
I don't think even is a
I don't know is a good choice or not I got I got two friends in
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work [lah]
there's things to do here and there
ya I think is mainly for people from like from poly the more #rilek# ones [lah] the [one] the not so snake [one]
ya
<malay> aku tak tahu
legit [ah] <malay> aku tak tahu aku tak tahu because I've only heard about all these like up there <malay> punya uni you know
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
<malay> macam gitu [ah]
<malay> tak tahu [ah] <malay> macam mana padahal baru week four
<malay> baik baru baru week <malay> besok is week four <malay> baru week four <malay> aku [dah] ada a test tomorrow
which is ten percent of my grades
<malay> besok (err) six thirty
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test [lah] [eh] no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so so my they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down [eh] where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they [ah]
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya [lah]
stewing from that [lah]
ya is it is a browser [lah] on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test [lah]
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test [what]
so they [ah] and then after that the test got webcam [ah]
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam [ah] either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam [what]
ya ya ya (um) the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
<malay> macam gitu [ah] [ah] I don't know [ah]
then (um) you imagine [eh] [kan] okay <malay> kau imagine <malay> kau masuk sekolah
<malay> kau masuk sekolah then at like my at like your second week they're like [oh] by the way
by the way
you have a report ya [ah]
[ah] <malay> aku aku macam !alamak! aku baru saja
<malay> masuk sekolah week two <malay> dia orang [dah] cakap [eh] you got report [ah] to write down I'm like [sia] [lah]
stress [pe] boy <malay> buat report
[ah] then <malay> apa
cause
ya then yesterday I spent like the
I think I spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because I've never actually I have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
(err) like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
I mean
I mean in poly you can just <malay> sembarang buat then okay <malay> [dah] some #chapalang# report okay <malay> [dah] submit
but
would uni I actually have to write I had like ten tabs open just
for
(um) just for this report section
ya [lah] I'm but as in what I'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
I got one friend who is taking this module as me
<malay> lepas tu he panicking already he panicking then he want he want
exempt from this module [lah] <malay> lepas tu dia macam [eh] <malay> ini macam mana ini itu macam mana [eh] <malay> aku tak tahu [ah] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh]
then you know he's just panicking [ah]
<malay> dia dari poly but I think <malay> dia dari poly <malay> juga but I think he he doesn't handle stress well [lah]
(mm) <malay> gitu
(mm) trimester
[ah] so but then for the first year
[ah]
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when I was comparing I was talking I was telling I was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in or even in you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because I have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay [lah] maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay [ah] trimester but then [eh] my trimester
thirteen weeks also [eh] then I see [eh] their semester
thirteen weeks [eh] like <malay> apa [sia] this one
what did I sign up for my my I got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small [lah]
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough I'm trimester based you know
ya
no [lah] (err) ya [lah] ya [lah]
[eh] <malay> mat susah bro serious <malay> aku cakap dengan kau susah
serious I didn't I didn't expect it to be
I didn't expect it to I have to put in so much effort you know
like (mm)
ya like my sisters were like !wah! #koi# #koi# run

I also don't want to be hardworking but
you know unfortunately I have to be
it's just unfortunately I have to be
eventhough I don't want to be because I want to <malay> macam #rilek# [ah] chill chill take my own sweet time but no you know I need to be like need to do this need to do that

[eh]
ya twenty eighteen <malay> kirakan bila haven't even graduate haven't even graduate ya
ya but then the thing is (um)
I applied too late like I applied in march also
so I was too late for the for everything so (uh) there was no slots for me [lah]
then on the twenty nineteen I applied again and then they asked for a video interview
and then after that the video interview then got the
mass interview like a group interview
ya ya ya but the video interview I got tell you or not the story before
okay the video interview <malay> kelakar gila bro serious so right
[ah]
they were like okay so the video they were giving me instructions [lah] it was like [oh] video interview is prerecorded
so that means it's not live
<malay> dia orang will <malay> dia dia orang will record their
questions
then they send it over to me
then
ya six questions <malay> gitu
ya ya
[ah] <malay> macam gitu
yes yes ya that type of thing [ah]
ya so the other day right (um) I I had that [lah]
and then after that [one] of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
(err) out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like [oh] shit
<malay> aku tak tahu [sia] module list <malay> apa so <malay> aku Google [lah]
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
(err) between question and answer <malay> aku Google [lah] <malay> untuk <malay> untuk dengan module list
<malay> aku Google <malay> untuk module list then <malay> aku tengok tengok tengok then okay <malay> aku [dah] boleh answer
<malay> lepas tu aku answer [kan] (mm) <malay> aku I said [ah] (hmm) (uh) looking through the module list right
I realised that there's this this this [lah] and have done
this this this in the past and also (uh) I have some experience with it okay next question
(err) what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list (err) I realised that there's maths [lah]
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths [lah] that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview [lah]
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview (um) it was (err)
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this (err) to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like [ah] then I was talking with my group my [lah] then I was like [eh]
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here [sia] going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know [ah] maybe [ah]
okay <malay> [dah] masuk [dah] sit down <malay> semua then they introduce themselves
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
then I'm like <malay> apasal ini okay <malay> buat [ah] <malay> buat buat buat [dah] berbual
<malay> [dah] berbual pasal content <malay> lepas tu [dah] nak record
<malay> [dah] record <malay> habis [kan] <malay> lepas tu kita hantar [ah]
then like okay you got any questions okay Q&A Q&A <malay> berbual berbual tanya tanya benda then I'm like
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home !huh!
<malay> gitu je <malay> aku macam [ah] [oh] serious [ah] <malay> gitu je [ah] <malay> aku tengok kanan kiri [sia]
ya and then like [ah] okay that's all I was like [ah] okay I expected something a bit more difficult [lah]
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the (uh) the email
saying whether you have passed or not [lah] like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now [lah]
(mm) okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like [eh] shit I never received any email [sia]
I never receive any email I was like fuck [ah] <malay> habis I didn't get [lah] after all
then on the eighth day in the morning [oh] I received the email congratulations <malay> baik baik baik
ya <malay> gitu [lah]
[ah] [ah] okay because right
is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort [lah]
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview [eh] our video presentation how was it
all all that thing [lah]
ya that's that's how I did it [lah] I don't know maybe because
but then last year
there wasn't be any COVID yet right
ya so I don't know maybe maybe because you applied too late [lah] honestly
<malay> apa dia
no no no
okay
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] so you are saying that like
<malay> macam because of COVID [kan]
so <malay> kau tak payah to be in the same situation that I am in
so is that what you're trying to say
[oh] okay [lah]

[eh] ultraboost is for casual this [one] is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation [lah] so I had this [ah]
I had this lake concept method the other time
and (err) I will I couldn't get it to work [lah] even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
then I was like <malay> kenapa [sia] <malay> tak boleh [oh] and then after that I spent I spent like
<malay> aku agak aku spend <malay> macam three four hours on it [lah]
three four hours okay I started at eleven <malay> aku habis pukul dua pagi tahu
<malay> aku habis pukul dua pagi then after that you know what was the problem
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax [lah]
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
then after <malay> aku just found out that it's because of spacing then <malay> aku bilang kawan aku [eh] okay <malay> kau try <malay> kau letak space
<malay> kau ada problem <malay> tak lepas tu dia orang letak space [a'ah] [lah] [sia] <malay> dia orang pun tak boleh
so <malay> dia orang boleh [ah] <malay> pasal dia orang tak letak space <malay> aku letak space <malay> tak boleh
[sia] [lah]
<malay> kau imagine <malay> tiga empat jam aku duduk depan computer <malay> [dah] pukul satu pagi aku tak is <malay> apasal tak boleh [ah] <malay> aku
<malay> garu kepala garu garu garu [ah] <malay> tak apa [ah] <malay> mandi [ah] <malay> mandi [dah] habis mandi solat [ah] okay okay relax <malay> sikit relax <malay> sikit
<malay> lepas tu continue <malay> buat kerja buat buat buat [eh]
<malay> apasal [eh] <malay> aku stock <malay> aku break down I rewrote my code like three four times
I break everything to everything down okay <malay> apasal ini input <malay> tak boleh ni ni input <malay> kalau aku tulis macam gini boleh ke tak then
ya [lah] so so that's what I I was trying to do [lah] so I break everything down I run bit by bit okay <malay> dari gini
<malay> kenapa tak boleh [eh] okay <malay> aku perasan aku tulis macam gini boleh aku tulis macam gini
<malay> apasal tak boleh [eh] then I found out [eh] okay <malay> aku kalau tak tulis dengan spacing
[eh] <malay> boleh [lah] [sia] <malay> aku tak [eh] <malay> pukimak irritating <malay> apa satu white space or because of one spacebar
<malay> dia kirakan kasi aku error
<malay> dia tunjuk dia tunjuk but but then what they're showing is right
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
then I'm like <malay> apa [sia] twelve comma <malay> tak boleh convert into integer
twelve comma <malay> boleh apa
<malay> habis tu it's because <malay> tahu aku letak twelve comma two comma eight
because that white space right that white space <malay> kirakan anything after that space bar everything will ignore
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course [lah] comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
<malay> aku macam [sia] [lah] <malay> kau orang kau orang just <malay> bunuh aku [sia]
four hours [ah] <malay> lepas aku masuk lepas tu aku [dah] baring aku [dah] baring [dah] masuk katil baring pukul dua two two [ah] two [oh] five <malay> gitu
