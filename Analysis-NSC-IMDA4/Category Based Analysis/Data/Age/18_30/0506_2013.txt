ya ya we straight up ignored him because like we don't want to
how to say like make it more I don't know how to say the tension like you know
like build up the tension or what [kan] so we just
so we just waited until like someone call him the another counter to call him and serve him [lah]
ya <malay>nasib</malay> [sia] if not [ah] [oh] my god if not I'm I have to like
[ah] actually confront him because I was almost on my like
how to say [ah] like my peak already I was already annoyed and <malay>ni dia lagi nak cari pasal dengan aku</malay> then I'm like I'm already a new staff
like you know then I'm like [ah] ya [lah] that's what happened [ah] that's one of it [ah]
(mm)
ya they think they think they old they
they we they think we need to serve them and everything but actually there's more (uh) actually [oh] my god
<malay>banyak kali</malay> [kan] [oh] <malay>apa ni ramai</malay> patients
will think that [oh] I wait for (mm)
hello [ah] (um) sorry I wait for one hour (um)
<malay>satu jam tahu macam gini macam mana ni satu jam</malay> I said (uh) yes (uh) ma'am
it is one hour the waiting time because it's a lot of patients not just you
correct right ya so ya some of them don't understand you know
ya [lah] which is which is expected [lah] but that's like one of the few incidents [lah] it's it's normal you know but like as someone who is a youngster
like to see a lot of (err) older people everyday
less younger people of the same age it's a bit like and they see you as a
younger person also they would be more like [oh] a younger person maybe I can <malay>hentam</malay> [ah] <malay>ketuk</malay> this <malay>ketuk</malay> this
kid [ah] then I can get my ways sometimes they're like that so sometimes we have to stand our ground [lah] ya so you know
singaporeans like very #kiasu# and very like you know
[ha] they !wah! new iphone new iphone [ah] they can what
<malay>beratur</malay> like <malay>satu jam dua jam</malay> [ah] but this [one]
for their own <malay>ubat</malay> [ah] they cannot what cannot wait you know you see that's the difference [ah]
so like I'm quite interested in like how you handle the like
your workplace ya like are they okay they're they're okay right
quite chill [lah] all okay [lah] okay [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya
smooth [ah] smooth [ah] #gucci# [ah] #gucci#
I don't know I I've been thinking about it cause like
you know now COVID nineteen right so <malay>macam banyak</malay>
me my course my course is (mm) media production and design [kan]
if I'm wrong [lah] so
ya I don't want to find like some <malay>kerja itu semua</malay>
(mm) like designer
can freelance but I also can like you know I can <malay>kerja</malay> like under a creative studio or
like magazine magazine you know [lah] whatever [lah] ya so anything advertising really so
like publicity or whatever it's just that I need to find which also
like which company that I want to go to because I think I
I you know a lot of people now want experience you know so
I don't know I've been thinking about it [lah] like
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen <malay>semua benda macam</malay>
like just stop like just stop and then like
basically our progress
of like (uh) (err) gaining skills like I don't know how to say like
<malay>semakin menurun</malay> so I've been thinking about internship
to intern like ya
got got intern but my intern is
was in the healthcare side at so it is related to my course
because I'm I do <malay>macam</malay> you know the video <malay>ambil ambil</malay> video <malay>kat kat</malay> video [ah] I do like
poster poster <malay>buat buat</malay> poster but for their events
for their events so like it's relevant but the
setting of work or the target audience is not really like
not not that it's not cup of tea it's a good experience
but it's just that my designs <malay>macam</malay> I my direction
I want to be more fun more young but
at there I'm just stuck with the older audience again and it's more about
not how to say [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ya bagus bagus</malay> design <malay>sangat</malay> it's just
what works what works ya I but I
okay [lah] I do give them quite good things but I'm limited by the fact that it's
the target audience is older so some colour I can't use they'll be more sensitive some font size ya because
if and I feel like a lot of info is inside (err) like a hospital [kan] nothing there already
there's bound to be a lot of info [lah] words so having a lot of bigger fonts
lesser design elements so <malay>macam tak berapa</malay>
extravagant you know [seh] I think so so I feel like if I were to be
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like <malay>macam</malay> gain experience
at somewhere that is more
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do [lah] you know what I mean like magazine editorial <malay>ke apa ke</malay> you know
ya ya but like (mm) it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen [lah] like what I'm saying <malay>macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua</malay> it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
for for employers also to even hire people now because they lack of you know money to even you know have manpower so right now I don't think it's a very good time to find jobs that
that are related to my career it's more to like <malay>macam</malay> survive [ah] like <malay>tak ada duit</malay> you know like you know like now like
(err) I feel quite sad [lah] like <malay>sekarang zaman sekarang</malay> our our like generation like
damn sad [ah] [ha] we never graduate
exactly
exactly
ya
yes correct correct
survival ya so you just take whatever [lah] <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] like what else
can we do you know like because it's not even a good time to think about career at the moment because like your career right now
(err) they they're all [lah] whatever (uh) whatever (um) like you say food business you you study
<malay>masak masak</malay> [kan] [ah] [ah] <malay>masak masak</malay> so like even now your I feel like your industry also <malay>kena</malay> affected [mah]
cause cause you know a lot of people don't dine can't dine that much all takeaway so it's harder [lah] basically ya so right now
ya [lah] like moving forward like right now I don't know what to do [lah] I feel like I don't now how to say I feel like we shouldn't
(err) to be so fixated with
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen [kan] [kan] <malay>dia</malay> teach you how to humble down and like
do not think so far because I feel like if you think so far you don't think that these kind of things will happen I feel like you should just plan at the things that is
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya <malay>macam kalau</malay> you plan your <malay>jauh pun</malay> then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then <malay>macam nak</malay> give up <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] so
ya [lah] [kan] so so I I
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] we can make it [lah]
[oh] my god yes [oh] my god yes yes I feel like I've lost my youth
ya <malay>budak budak sekarang</malay> like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
fun things to do but we can't actually do it because our like I don't know going concert or (uh) like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this <malay>ramadhan</malay> can't go like mosque or what
[oh]
yes it's also affected [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> a lot of
you can say relationships are affected in the sense like that I feel lonely I feel lonely
and like how to say I feel so <malay>macam</malay> deprived <malay>gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap</malay> it's not that I
want to see but the like last time the how to say the level of interaction that we have last time and now is so different it affects us
mentally [lah] ya and I've been seeing all those tweets and everything people are really sad and everything I think largely
is a factor because people don't get to meet people I think that's the most important thing [lah] like you know like entertainment wise
[oh] ya correct correct correct
ya
ya
ya
correct correct correct are you an extrovert
(mm)
(mm)
how how how
[oh]
can who say cannot ya I changed also I changed also from extroverted now I'm okay I'm actually no I'm always actually when I took the test
<malay>aku</malay> <malay>selalu</malay> actually middle actually <malay>aku</malay> ambivert [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
but now is more now since last time I'm ambivert [kan] but now is more introverted
(mm)
the thing is ya ya
yes correct correct correct
correct
ya but it has become draining [ah] but ya sometimes ya it gets draining
correct correct ya correct correct
like but now I prefer to be alone [ah] but it's just the people that I <malay>macam nak</malay>
<malay>siapa siapa yang</malay> I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
can relate [lah] like you have a lot of friends but you just want to hang out with just five of them [lah] like that like you just don't want to hang out with them you know
ya so <malay>macam</malay> ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
I think it affects us [ah] like if we ever like once the COVID nineteen is done or whatever I think it will be hard to adapt back to how we were you know
ya ya
ya [lah]
(mm) I'm just I don't know I feel like okay
so since (uh) we talk about this COVID nineteen thing [eh] I feel like I don't know I'm recently very like
upset about the worldly issue that has been going going like black man and everything right
ya ya me too
correct correct what might happen ya I ya but like (err)
there's a lot of like bombings also (um) in #gaza# and everything so it just makes makes how to say [ah] it's more we get
since we're in our house <malay>macam kita kat duduk kat rumah</malay> [kan] it's more like [oh] sometimes we are so blinded <malay>macam</malay>
ya we we don't see it you know
like I feel like now singaporeans start to realise how privileged they are because like we don't have such problems we do have problems
but I'm also quite glad that
I don't know because we have the general election thing and everything so I feel like I think
to talk about sensitive issue minorities and everything so I feel like I hope that
once once the COVID is over or what there will be more (err) faster I don't know
more changes to more ya progress to like <malay>macam</malay> make singapore more
like the quality <malay>semua ke apa</malay> [kan] like more (err) out there
basically be more open to such issues instead of [oh] being
close minded that kind of thing just because the government doesn't talk about it but now I realise [oh] actually
!wow! we are like ya [sia] we think we think singaporeans we're like smart and everything but no [seh] I think
I think I realise that a lot of us like as a nation we lack empathy to
ya to such matters [ah]
yes correct
<malay>macam kau</malay> yes correct correct
older generation ya
mindset ya
ya
yes correct correct correct
<malay>macam tak like <malay>tak ramai sangat yang</malay>
<malay>setuju</malay> (um) I don't know what I'm talking [ah] but like they don't agree
especially like you said the older generation they don't agree a lot to our
younger people people's view or or take on on how it should be or what because they think they're like
older and everything but I think it's because they're too ingrained like their traditional values is too
ingrained already it's like [oh] [eh] (um) <malay>aku dah apa</malay> I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>degil sangat</malay> [lah] you know what again but I really hope that
they start to <malay>macam</malay> open up <malay>sikit</malay> and then more or less
ya
I I I I'm quite
I'm quite glad [ah] like you know cause like
(err) I like I have faith [lah]
for like this
what <malay>rakyat</malay> you know caring you know like I hope <malay>singapura macam</malay>
will be a better country for the people [lah] not just for economic
I don't know economic <malay>macam</malay> image you know like how <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>nak</malay>
like it has a certain
image that it wants to capture like how it's very
green eco green very luxurious expensive but
we have a lot of
what is it called
<malay>banyak</malay>
flaws [ah]
that like <malay>banyak banyak</malay> gaps a lot of gaps
that we ya but ya [lah] I just hope that things change [lah]
ya so right now what's important right now is I'm hungry

okay [ah] okay [ah] okay
actually I can recall almost <malay>banyak</malay> [ah]
okay it's okay don't worry don't worry okay
where do we where do I start
I don't know [ah] chill [eh] <malay>kejap</malay> let me think let me think
okay so okay I
<malay>aku aku masuk apa ni</malay>
<malay>sekolah apa ni</malay>
springfield secondary
okay <malay>lepas tu</malay>
my I join (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> floorball
ya so I
[oh] you didn't know [oh] okay
ya so I started with sports okay but I bored of it anyway ya floorball then [ah] ya
four years [ah]
yes correct from sec one
ya <malay>macam</malay> C division <malay>itu semua</malay> B division
C division I think we got second then B division we got second
I I I became the captain I think
ya it was like shocking because
okay
I'm like quite a perfectionist
so last time (uh) I'm not good at floorball but there were like
other <malay>orang yang macam dah tahu main</malay> floorball
so I thought that maybe this is the chance to learn a new sport
so you know what I did
okay basically I didn't have the stick and everything I didn't have the funds
to <malay>macam beli</malay> stick <malay>itu semua</malay> [ah] so I made my own stick
ya I did [ah] I used <malay>macam sapu kau tahu penyapu dia punya yang</malay> wood <malay>tu</malay> ya
then ya I I I
it's the not the wooden [one] it's the screw-able
that [one] ya I took it out then I use hanger the steel hanger
to form the shape of the blade
ya then after that I wrap it in wrap the blade
in in tape
as thick as possible then I attach it to the ya to the
I I practise at home I did once bring it at school but (uh)
[ah] but if I don't remember but I showed them okay maybe not maybe not
but I use a normal you know kiddy ball <malay>macam</malay> [eh] kiddy ball
<malay>macam budak budak yang</malay> kids <malay>suka main tu yang</malay> bouncy ball
[ah] I use that as a floorball ball [lah] then the thing I use use use I play <malay>aku</malay> practise [lah]
<malay>aku</malay> practise practise practise and you know the grip is not nice
at all because it's circle it's very thick and everything
floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand <malay>bengkak</malay>
like it was swollen
ya
ya because it's the training stick [ah] the not so good [one] but training stick
[ah] I bought [lah] using but that's when they they told me you can buy using [ah] what is it called [ah] last time
medisave [eh] medisave no medisave edusave medisave edusave edusave !aiyo! [ah]
education whatever thing [lah] then like
ya [lah] then I once I bought the stick I practise almost everyday
I flunk my grades literally
because I practise every day I stay back at school ya I prioritise that (uh) because I
[ah] I swear <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> shoot [sial] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> shoot
everytime I try to shoot [kan] the ball will always roll on the floor
it will never be a high shot <malay>macam</malay> shot or low shot <malay>gitu</malay> so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
it's there's a there's a boy and a girl but we don't mix the trainings [ah] unless the stupid teacher wants [ah]
but that's (err) that's another story [lah] but like
ya so I train train train train train
and then I I think my teacher noticed or something like that
then I think that's why I became the floorball captain or some shit like that
ya because I trained on my own timing that kind of thing
and I actually got better I actually got better
ya but I failed my grades [lor] but
it's okay [lah] I got to be the captain [lah] so once I did
I
I don't know felt nice but I felt unrecognised
because okay basically [kan] floorball is <malay>macam</malay> <malay>yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua</malay>
so okay for me I find I'm ugly [ah]
I'm ugly back then [ah] honestly [ah] among the girls and most of the pretty girls already
know how to play floorball
so people expected that they would be one of the ones that will get the position [lah]
so when I got it because I was really an outcast
not they don't dislike me but I felt
a certain of like acceptance
no acceptance because because me and my friend one side only
because they never <malay>ajak</malay> us <malay>ke apa</malay> they just let us one side
to do all thing but once I got to be the captain or announced as the captain
they started like asking me like to join them and everything but I also ask my friend
who were outcasted to join me [ah] that's how the the team bond [ah]
ya but then my secondary school like quite dramatic also [ah] I'm sure your [one] also dramatic right
[oh]
okay okay <malay>tu bagus</malay> [ah] actually
[oh] okay
you you involved
[oh]
I'm okay with you
[oh]
okay I'm quite
quite surprising [seh] to find out that your most drama life was in poly
class drama okay I think
(mm)
that's good [lah] because for me I'm involved in it because of the people I know
the floorball drama is I'm not involved in it but it's just that you know
floorball <malay>macam</malay> collective it's a collective you're in the floorball then you means you're floorball members [ah] so
there's a lot of rumours about very petty [lah] just about girls being pretty then
they date date they date date date date and everything
yes so
so I'm not involved in in it anyway it's just like that kind of thing but I also do
stay away [lah] from them but then if you want to get the team together you kind of have to
kind of get on their good side so that they can listen to you that kind of thing so
but it went well [lah] because we're the most bonded
team [ah] because we didn't like the seniors the seniors very stuck up
they think they're good and everything but we got the most achievements
so we're like [leh] we're a better batch
ya we were the junior team
and we brought a lot of medals [ah]
ya so
secondary school was fun and everything then I like failed math then I'm like
okay so what's next so
so I go and do then after that [oh] I [oh] design don't need math
then <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] <malay>apa</malay> set [ah] then I then I go interview then I like
(uh) my science also but it was a D seven I think it's a pass but my math was the one [ah]
but then I was I chose a design school so it didn't matter that much I guess
my language was okay
so now [ah] that's how I got into ford [lor]
ya
that's what I was thinking cause
(uh) I heard a lot about like drama
(uh huh) floorball specifically
so actually I was quite burnt out being the captain and
(err) I don't know just very tiring so for me to go there
and continue it and imagine like it's far it's far then training
confirm <malay>malam</malay> I stay at #bedok# like <malay>jauh</malay> [kan] I was like
that's man I was like
time for a switch up let's go volunteering
that's how I that [ah] then [lah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] that's how I ended up in
in smart asia [lah]
cause [ah] my friend also [lah] cause her friend is in
is the vice president but [eh] president so she asked me to join the team
and I also wanted to do something
volunteering because I wanted to add on also to my to my
life skill and resume or something like that [lah] so
I damn burnt out by sports it's I'm bored of it [lah] basically
how to say [ah] I actually I love sport
but it took a toll on me because
I had to buy the equipment and and and I'm not so well off too at that point of time to buy
ya it's like a burden [ah] for my parents to keep buying me shoes and all so I
think
I could come back to it if I want to because
after my secondary school right I actually join external club
ya I actually joined [eh] few seasons and all but the trainings were right after school and like
so that made me like !wah! another commitment
but it was already after (um)
[oh] haven't it was O-level I forgot then I quit then I quit then I quit then I quit then after that
they asked to come back again that's why I was like no I no to the club
it's (um) I just feel like I have the passion for it but
it's not what I want to do in the end so
maybe not my passion [ah] but you get what I mean I don't know me as a person I like to try everything and I want to do
good in everything and that's me [lah] but that's the thing [lah] I can't focus on one thing [lah]
right now it's not I think it's becoming popular
<malay>tapi tak ya I think it's becoming popular because I think we're good at floorball
because I go to I go watch <malay>macam tengok</malay> tournament <malay>itu semua</malay> [kan] some of my friends are in the national team
so
it's becoming popular because we're good at it I think now ya we're good at it we came in
the asia games we came in third or second that's not bad [ah] honestly
but national wise (um) don't know yet [lah] but I think not bad [lah]
not bad I think not bad [ah] honestly not bad [ah]
ya but if you if you were in it I think you will know the there's competition to watch
same like other [lah]
so ya [lah] I decided to do the volunteering thing then of course I met you [lah] that's how I met you [lah]
like
I don't know I was so nervous actually because like
it was such a weird
like
it's not weird [lah] it's like
it didn't feel like everybody was there for the same thing
it's like do you get what I mean I don't know how to say like some just join because this is the most #chillest#
kind of kind of thing but some join okay of course I want to help and everything
then
and then like
ya I didn't know you that much [ah] I think the only time I actually got to know you was during the camp
the smart asia camps right
ya
I thought I thought you I don't know [eh] I was kind of scared of you [lah]
I feel like you like a
I don't know like you <malay>minah</malay> like that [eh] I don't know why [ah] I damn scared of you [sia]
legit legit legit legit but actually you're very friendly
not like not like you look [lah] but then you
have the vibes but you're quite smiley [lah] so
ya but then I also
not I also don't mind also
talk talk to other people so it's okay but then actually
didn't expect then
ya [lah] actually quite fun [ah] actually
smart asia was the most #randomest#
thing ever
quite a lot right
[kan] in fact
I know okay one thing for sure <malay>kau punya</malay> idea <malay>bagus gila</malay> like no joke and some
flower actually everything actually almost all

I feel like end up right
we'll always be the last ones to stay back and last ones to do the thing cause we're the organisers of the thing
correct correct
yes correct correct
but we're trying to
the worst I feel like the worst is the camp
because we didn't make our camp remember we made the dance night last minute
because nobody actually wanted to go it's only like five people seven people
then like !wah! damn sad [eh]
because I feel like
I don't know like I said I think
people were there for different reasons not particularly to commit to it [ah]
they just want to have a so like
[oh] there's actually point incentives to do let's join this [one] instead and get
points that kind of thing right cause got the <malay>apa apa</malay>
point system or something like that
so ya [lah] I think it was fun [lah]

!aiya!
okay
but you made it though
ya ya
(mm)
that's quite interesting flow of experiences
primary
not really
(mm)
then <malay>sekarang kau kau nak</malay> plan plan <malay>pergi</malay> university <malay>tak</malay>
you did [ah]
my [eh] my also same
[eh] I kind of want to but I don't know what course
but the thing is I also don't know there is there is but the design is very specific
your what going to design very emotional design graphic graphic design
video video so I don't know what I exactly want
ya it can be also content design
or data I don't know [lah] a lot of stuff [lah] they want specialist specialist
I actually want to be a creative director
ya meaning
if there's a project visually I'm I I'm in charge
so let's say it's a photoshoot let's say it's a photoshoot
if I'm the creative director
the props is me the concept is me
that kind of thing [ah] so you can if you're a graphic designer
you can the it's more production
but if you start from designer also can because you already have the visually your own
own kind of taste and everything then you can put the element inside
production okay for example I'm trying to think of
a concept yes okay let's say creative creative creative director (um)
I'm the creative director of
so the show the art direction of the show the concept of the show
is up to me
can can be
can be small can be big ya can be small can be big (um)
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> gigs <malay>gitu</malay>
it can be magazine creative director so can apply for a lot of stuff
so
but creative director is you need a lot of you need to know your shit [lah] basically
you need to like you worked with so many people you know so you need to be out a lot of
ya that kind of thing also can but just anything that makes it I don't know I feel like right now
I'm not stuck to one just just try everything see what I like the most
but I'm quite I like media it's just that media is
I need to <malay>macam</malay> start from the bottom media and not
but I like I want to make my own films
cause in films you can make your own design also [what] technically
I have but it's only for personal videos [ah]
not not like a thing thing [kan] but I can do a lot it's just
you need nowadays you need to be different
like stand out I think so it's hard to have a brand basically to make a brand
but it's okay [lah] should can [lah] basically but anyway I'm just saying like
!wow! I didn't know that you had that (err) roller coaster of jumping on
a lot of interests and it's very different from each other
ya cause I'm just like
[oh] that's how you get got into culinary I I'm quite like surprised
I can't believe that like what really everyone
ya what what would you do if it's not
actually you can [seh] I don't know I think you can [eh] no but you can [eh]
but still your design not bad
I think it's not bad it's just that you needed to develop it
but (mm)
ya ya ya that's true that's true <malay>kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus macam</malay>
<malay>kau boleh buat banyak benda kau boleh</malay> adapt adapt adapt adapt adapt
then <malay>kau belajar belajar sekali</malay>
<malay>cuma cuma kau tak tahu apa nak</malay>
develop which one ya cannot decide which is actually same problem problem with me I also don't know what to focus on
but then they say it's good to be good at everything
that kind of thing
master of none
but like but that's the thing though I think <malay>macam</malay> singapore [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> they have like this emphasis on <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau mesti bagus</malay> at everything but like let's say
okay I want to work as a
architecture okay then you major but <malay>nanti</malay> they say [oh] no you have to have good record
the end of the day but then not just grades you know but nowadays it's not really about grades so
you know what I mean
that's why
ya but I think nowadays
I don't know how to say adaptability
maybe I'm just being biased but adaptability I think [ah] poly student will adapt better than a student
which is unfair actually
like they say they say get experience get experience we have experience
[oh] sorry [ah] you don't have you don't have a university cert you don't have a cert so sorry [ah] sorry
then the other person will be like [oh] (uh) you're accepted then I'll be like !huh! why I wasn't accepted
[oh] the it's not the standard and everything and I'm like [oh] and they have a higher pay
just because you know unfair quite unfair quite unfair [ah]
quite unfair [ah]
the world is unfair but it's fine you know what they you know you know a great person once said
like is unfair so that it is fair to everyone
you know who who said that me
no [lah] no [lah] I I made it made it up myself
I think it has to be unfair for everyone so it will be unfair for all so it's like
correct correct
which is why I feel like
it's not fair to judge someone
(uh) like by how much they work
cause like they always say this
(uh) if you work hard enough you will get it actually not true [eh] it's all about chances and opportunities and connections
and that's I feel like the reality of it is true is
it will never be it I don't know [ah] but it will never be measured by how much you work
is it will always be measured by
it will be controlled by someone who has
the upper hand
that controls how much we work and all cause we will
like how to say you'll never escape
you will always be working under somebody
ya that's why like robot robot robotic
ya but like ya I feel like I don't think
now that I think of it last time [kan] we always <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] <malay>aku nak jadi orang kaya</malay> then when you rethink about it now <malay>macam</malay> maybe I don't want to be a rich person
I feel like being rich here I I could be a
that's like the same as me being a evil person
you know what I mean if I'm not fair [lah] if I'm not fair
labour it's like there's so many chains under
under under under under under us <malay>lagi</malay> you know like this so it's like
I think humans are the reason why
we don't do well we just
[ah] <malay>mata merah</malay>
ya
correct
so it be forever like a cycle so humans humans eat other humans [lah] to survive
where it should be like
I got your back cause I'm a human also I wish people like
<malay>macam apa</malay>
a bit more
<malay>apa bersefahaman</malay> [eh] why is does that sound like a paper kind of
section
no like more like basically understanding each other instead of
just
(uh) just see it as it is
like it's a bad thing [oh] it's a bad thing but there's more to a bad thing the bad thing could be like
[oh] the person didn't mean it it's by the own circumstances that made it like that you know I mean so
yes correct correct yes
ya
like I've always thought about it like
being good and being bad like
if you have the
capacity to be bad then you have the capacity to be good
if you have the capacity to be good you have the capacity to be bad
so not everyone is good not everyone is bad everyone is just human
[kan] you can't compare to anyone else because we don't know
we don't know everything [ah] basically
ya correct ya so we cannot like judge
but then judge is in our nature [what]
