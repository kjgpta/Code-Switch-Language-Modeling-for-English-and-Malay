mm
yes
correct correct correct
yes
yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya
understand understand
ah
ya
yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective uh a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think uh it's quite it's it's something that uh there I I would I would um and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn lah
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
oh right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
oh definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
ah no no it was a academic uh more of a academic kind of uh mistake lah uh I mean it was a academic um how to say ah misstep which which I could have my my my um my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science ah which means then after that err the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was uh just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six ah I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit ah when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis ah so I had to remove my appendix because err it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had err not err what err gone to the hospital lah uh if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication uh in which this this uh operation actually made my stomach lining weak
uh because they have to cut they have to cut through mah so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my err my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another lah basically so it was first it was an appendix then uh it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical eh in a medical sector your intestines uh usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
uh apparently that can be fixed okay err and and basically what happens is uh if you fix it uh generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this uh this condition but um the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and uh hopefully hopefully lah ah cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again lah
huh this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was uh in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is err err specifically flying related
so uh they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day uh but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying lah
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that ah oh debt uh I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them uh ah no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate uh site I was actually doing uh business business aircraft when I was in the
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened err this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad err I mean it was just a very bad timing ah it was the worst hit industry ever uh unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and uh they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old lah so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again ah
to the parts ah they get uh they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
uh some of them they do but most of them for the most part err they don't need right they just they juts leave them there lah they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there ah nobody wants to uh you know ah then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this lah you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be lah
oh man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of uh of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot lah this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was uh it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay lah so I thought it was uh it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did lah and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
but but for now uh I got the next best thing which is uh flying drones lah
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers eh
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen ah but if that ever happens ah you will know why ah you know all about the history behind it lah you can tell people oh yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya lah yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know oh my goodness
yes
yes yes yes

ah
ya ya eh tell me about your some of your your ya ya ya what are you doing now and stuff
okay
okay
okay
okay okay
mm
okay
why I scared to be bankrupt because I don't want to owe people money
ah but then a lot of things are restricted like you cannot uh apply for your own home you cannot invest
ah but if you're somebody with a home and if you are declared bankrupt then they will take away their home what no meh not true eh is it oh I didn't know I thought they will take why all your your earthly belongings and your possessions
oo
oo okay okay explain to me
uh huh

if I don't pay my utility bills will they take away my house
oh shit oh my I still have my house lah it's just that I have no electricity okay okay

so you can still but how are you going to have the money to travel when you are bankrupt

okay
mmhmm
okay
I don't buy under my name
uh huh
uh huh okay
oo but wouldn't they be able to trace
because just because it's not under my name lah so if it's so so the thing is that if if let's say all these things are under my name then they can pull it away they can take it away
ah I see
mm
ya ya ya ya
ah
mm

ah I see okay okay okay
so so it's not that you cannot get a job it's just that the jobs that you uh ah able to get are limited lah certain industries ah
mm
ah I see
ya ya ya I see I see okay okay
the system lah ya lah that's true
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
so technically
damn
damn
oh my gosh
ya
mm
mm
correct correct correct
oh shit man ya I get oh wah like that lah I tell you your finances are going to be
I see I see
okay
two more minutes
ah
ah

school is fine but it is very boring um because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
Y-
like from other courses kan
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
go eat together
then when your school start
true
mm ya
mm
mm
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
uh in the because we have like college west
east right
and then err west and east they don't
like because in like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
um
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like uh
tests we take tests we take uh we do assignments we do uh
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade lah like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
um
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
uh like
ah I talk about like first
ah seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life lah
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood ah that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
um
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online jer lah but then it's very complicated because like
uh what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
uh mental uh mental disabilities is
a lot to that
and then
um minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then ah like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like err after finishing exam right
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
so it's just but I just want to sleep
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like oh my god we just stay in the first semester why ah why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
mm
mm
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
uh
mm
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
uh
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
uh
how you
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
how you
but then I find it very like
even
like
it's better if you can finish earlier kan in a sense but then
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand lah
because he is the type of person that think very like
oh he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
then after that
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more lah a lot of like opportunities for students
our class is my class it's very competitive like
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like uh
like secondary school
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
it will be like very like easy right
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
uh
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like oh okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
oh my god
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
damn
this is gonna be hard and then ah I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
not a lot of paths for you to go
you know that
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
uh for a few years and like
cause that's what I want to learn what since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity kan I just want to go for like child psychology
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking lah we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like ah you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter kan
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
that is the shock and then I think
go to poly after
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
like ego is what
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I uh sleeping
it's a good day but then it's like
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least eh there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like ugh
older and more responsibility in a sense
and then ah one of
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
I would choose studies lah if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you uh I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated ah she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
kan
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and aqil are going there for
err early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but hada don't want to go
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
mm
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
mmhmm it's like
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
like like
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like ugh and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say ah
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes lah
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time lah but then like then you realise at the end already right
how I am
you have a lot of happiness in you
because my friends say you number one when you break up eh
like that's not good
it's but ah then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID kan
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even raziq sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january imelda is different from
september imelda now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
you know that kind of thing
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is raziq
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually ah I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
checks up on our like
uh she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
uh
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
in a sense lah
cause
ah
we just like uh
cause
but ah same to me ah
mm cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down

ah

I mean
quirky what do you mean by quirky
uh huh
like your mug ah
oh that's quirky ah
then
so what do you mean by aesthetically pleasing but
no lah anything lah
you know actually I was thinking I've been thinking how how our house will look like
like if if we were to apply for the woodlands one right
as in
we we don't do like a proper
uh like you know those proper interior design stuff that sort of thing we just put whatever wherever that is
make it make it more unique lah like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say uh
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like
and not
you know but then still have a theme
but then like mix and match
ya
like maybe uh
you know how how I say I don't want to buy furniture but I want to make my own furniture
no why
you scared you scared not strong ah
huh
no lah
okay okay okay
I I finish talking already
what
okay like maybe uh I will build my own pond for my turtles
build own cage for our future lovebirds
uh huh
ah decoration you know
you keep like personal touch so what what what what
oh ya
hmm
what what what what what did she say
oh
ah
umah
why
oh
what did
ah
uh huh
and then
ya
chickens are not legal
no because
ya
like cats are also not legal in what
no like according according to the law cats are not allowed in but then the the the law enforcer
don't rely enforce it unless if someone complains
so ya but then for chicken right is ended I think
uh because it's a poultry meat
so like uh like they don't want
things like bird flu and all
spread
so that's why they they don't allow chicken
but then
I think
um because the law is quite new I think like less than ten years I think
somewhere around there
ya
but
I mean same same as
other illegal pets lah that are
it's got some people keep snake and all also what they ask people to adopt snake
ya lah obviously
ya
I
I want a pond for my turtle
then the pond right I want to put back real soil real plant
then they can lay egg over there also
then we got more turtle
then can
breed more I guess or
or you want to give give it away

very long time
investment

it's like you know like the survival of the fittest lah
ya ya he say err work hard or work in mcdonald's

ah
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay err honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's ah we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly um
K initially err this is like my third err application to you know ah sorry should I should not mention the name lah
um
almost to like a nine K eh err nine K of err school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
when it comes to studies wise err
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of err I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ah
so and then I saw in err semester three I told myself no I cannot
and then my my results was alhamdulillah I mean I I was quite surprised ah that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten lah
and then err I remember sitting with this err with this lady lah she is err from penang you know she no no I I I went penang sorry ya I went penang and then I was on my way back from penang to singapore via flight so there was this err lady that I I sat beside and then err

I am planning to do my internship in singapore because at the end of the day I'm going to come back and and work here
yup
understood
yup yup
err whether I want to go into teaching whether I want to go into academics or whether I want to go into err media I still haven't decide lah I mean
so I will say lah in the next err one and a half years start starting from october

I've been doing well lah actually what about you
wah actually it was not bad leh like uh at first
uh I thought like I'll have a lot of problems but actually it was quite smooth
Law and Literature so ya very interesting
then uh you in what school now
a'ah
oh so uh what course
oo that's interesting
mm
mm
mm
true
then
mm
um floorball
ya it's a very interesting sport
oo then what type of sport do you prefer then
mm
mm
hmm
alamak
eh
mm
mm
then
mm
it's a unique course I would say
ya and err this course is like it appeals to me lah because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
mm
oo so
oh so recently I just uh finish my semester one so some of the courses I sorry I mean modules I picked was
I did was uh design and colour so I do like graphic designs and stuff and I also uh besides coding I also learn uh concept
oo that's not bad
yeah that's poly life man like most of the time you are just like spending time with your friends doing project work
internship eh
oh
true
oh
oh
wah
like during that that test
oh right
mm
oh
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well lah
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
ah
mm
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally uh do uh my hobbies
yeah
yep
go for the trials err because I um I'm actually afraid of rejection
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then um so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
wah how was it
yeah
oh for what
oh
mm
ah
yeah
mm
oh
wow
ya man I can't imagine myself
wah all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
then
uh other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so uh how
oh
yeah
I
eh then oh
eh you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
ah small business
no no no you you meant ah calligraphy is it
oh yeah yeah
yeah eh
mmhmm
ih
oo
wah wah tell me more
yup
list them all
oh
oh
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
true
ya
ya
ya true true
wah for me right
yes
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
wah I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator eh with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
oh
mm
ya uh me also like most of the time is always like cause I
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
uh it can be done but it's just very hard
my course is interaction design kan so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm uh ideas together and then come up with like uh a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting lah because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
uh how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
ya that's about it
for you eh
mm
why kay you tell me
how rabak
wah I legit also don't like this type of people leh like they really make my blood go up eh like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to ah take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works lah
mm
oh
oh I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
oh
oh that's interesting
ah ya ya
mm
oh that's good that's good
yeah
oh
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app ah because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good um for me I think your app is very beneficial lah for people yeah
oo that's good
ya ya ya very interesting eh
mmhmm
mm
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
wah
that's cool
mm
wah
ya ya ya very interesting
oh
oh
ya
mm
mm
ya ya
mm
and what are some of the
the like
oh ya
ya
wah actually I make friends very instantly eh it's like ya because err okay the good thing about technology is that err
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school lah so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya
you eh what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
wah my one don't have eh cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad leh
oh
huh really ah
oh
oh I see I see
oh
mm
I I think not bad leh the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time um my I had I had this uh program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours lah then you will get the
it was so hot
ya
ya
mm
right
wah
ya
really ya it is
oh ya ya I've done the morning shift one before it's very very tiring
ya
oh maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad lah this COVID there ah spoil all the plan eh then like legit man then ah spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
mm
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay
mm interesting rolls royce okay
oh so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him lah you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so wah when he joined what was his uh education uh certificate diploma so so he join uh it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant uh then he gets to stay there with his family
mm ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house lah well that's good that's good so so he so he's uh he told you that he signed bond for five years with uh
five years okay so uh is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree oh okay I think uh singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face ah
oh it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but ah but who will pay for this uh school the company or the company will reimburse
oh that's good
if you have to stay until the company
mm that means err work and study ah ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
oh really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good um
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so err for a wait
when when did when did I said err when err I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then um
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
mm so what she working as now oh searching
almost a year so until now no job
oh okay so did she graduate from or
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so uh maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then uh then can just move on lah
anyway
so uh what's the status about your bike
uh the so when is it going to change the
uh cover set what's the plan
yes
okay so meaning still need to do something to the bike so this time is engine not the exhaust okay both so the mechanic still in process me ah in a way he grew there
okay very good
uh okay um good to hear ah hopefully it will not extend beyond january
okay why to bring the bike to go where
fireworks ya so um
what's the plan for you and your hundred dollar voucher actually
so
okay ya ya they have to queue for more than four hours at uh orchard hotel
where you know about this
oh okay okay someone like review
what hotel is that do you know
oh okay concord um it's quite old anyway um so about this uh we were talking about your job right so you're you graduated with uh diploma in engineering correct engineering informatics so pretty much is engineering lah okay like azri's job

mostly it's engineering electrical rovers
okay
oh assistant engineer ah

ya
uh any particular companies that you are eyeing for
tivo ya
okay so do you know if they are hiring
maybe you just get the email then can just drop her an email if it's the same person lah
mm okay okay then um
so that means you just mentioned just now uh how about okay it also open right
so is that something that you can see yourself doing oh okay okay
okay okay okay so depends on what is it lah ya also not choosy right for now okay that's good then so for uniform group okay that's good okay um okay let's see

I mean ya lah that's fine lah that's not part of furnitures
I know I know
I know you tell your mum that our future house is gonna be a zoo
because your mum asked me about it
she said
it she asked me if it's true if I know that you are going to make our future house look like the zoo
and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal
why
but why chickens are not legal
but I see some people have some people have chicken you know
no you can have cats in just as long as they don't they are not terrorizing our neighbours
ya
ah ya lah
so
okay
but why are people asking us to adopt chickens
but I think that one is really now illegal
I think that one is really now very much illegal compared to chicken
I I want a lovebird
but
you wanna be a turtle breeder
I don't think any but I I think not I think I don't think anybody wants to keep turtles for a long time
because they take up a lot of space
they really take up a lot of space
yes
yes can you give me awhile I want turn off the aircon
yes
because
I'm recording
ya I'm recording what
but it is very cold
I don't know I tell you I don't have the remote
but I think is the lowest
yes but I think it's the lowest
I mean like
ya I've never like changed the temperature
before so ya
eighteen
hmm
sometimes
must put air at home
yes
no
no
no
no
no
where
me see
I cannot see
no
oh oh oh oh oh I can see I can see
ya
what
correct
you are working today
huh
again
until what time
until
four fifteen
at where
do you earn a lot
how much
oh
not bad
not bad
ya
but but what
why you never do the that like like that time you do the afternoon
oh
oh
ya nevermind lah at least as long as like there's money coming in you know
so are you going to sleep after this
after this are you going to sleep
hmm
hmm
you know hanis never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me eh
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want lah
too lazy to talk to her
hais
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how rina always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from sonya that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know hanisah
they have leadership this leadership program lah basically but like
um sofia and rina said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked hanisah how long are you bonded with the school lah and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her ah because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her lah the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only ah ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand ah like twenty two thousand I can understand lah but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already lah anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true what like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her lah I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with sufian and rina what like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare lah she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense what
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand eh
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know lah
I don't know at first she didn't tell me lah today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know lah is it
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say ah who knows rina she say this you know who knows rina have something planned for me like dude
even if rina has something planned for you rina is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different eh in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss saba
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents ah but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the lah what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see lah and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like lah and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know ah
and okay okay ya

at least
lame ah lame ah
about about
town red what town
when I was sec three
it is much more err not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
err you just come
mayor lah then like also same same thing like
there the town will like discuss on who is the
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game ah
but if we're in town of salem this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game lah but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore
ya something like that lah but you have to survive ah basically their task is to survive ya lah like among us
ya not one impostor like
like mafia mafias like got your three people together
did you watch this err youtube

it's called I forgot what is they called it
I don't know I don't know what they called it but they also they also play some game similar to that

ya that ya bro that is twenty seventeen bro it was trending that's why all of us were talking about it
trend man
ya the prime of youtube whoa I was
so grateful that was alive for that chey

so technically you are watching
one episode
a two hour episode you know what I mean

loki loki quite cool though like interesting you know like a new dimension of loki
loki from another dimension
ya lah they were the one to killed the character technically the character is dead
in
technically
technically if you think about it right if they open a multiverse right dimension all these they won't die lah the characters won't die
and the thing is suddenly like the other character from the other universe can come here come back you know
ya
somehow or some way they will come back one day
mm mm
mm mm mm exactly
that maybe that's why they want to do that's why they want to do with the movie they want to do something like the comics
it also make a lot of money so
oh ya ya ya
huh
oh I get it I get it I get it
deadpool
forty minutes
ya
mm mm
we can actually do that I think actually we supposed to do that right now we just talking among among ourselves it's actually the same thing what

don't say first person shooter lah
oh so you like mm mm you you you will buy a but you wouldn't buy a because you want to play games is like a casual work

so if you ever wanna
ah if you ever want to buy buy a
like like err don't buy pre build like you buy the parts yourself okay I mean like
don't buy don't buy you should make yourself
but
but but I got but but but like
there are shops where they you need you choose the parts
then they will build it for you
then is also a better option
ah
like thirty frames per second to maybe below that and
ya
oh
oh ya ya
exactly exactly like that the
like you cannot
like your base four and your base X box one it doesn't work like it's unplayable
like
ya ya
I don't watch tiktok lah but like I saw that on twitter a lot of people complaining
then but they say like the best is like five ah or seems like the next gen consoles lah of course I'm not surprised lah
technically depends lah but I think what what I think is hardware problem because the four
uh huh like long time ago
so like like you know next gen they can handle this kind of thing
that's why
you know got
you know got the footlocker one the wah the
cause
okay lah true true true
but also like partially
ya ya ya
ya ya COVID nineteen also
exactly
then like I I watch some I watch some like videos they say like
the footlocker should have like actually do like an online job instead and like not
like not the
ya ya understand also lah so that right now I don't think there's actually any actual solution to this
uh uh best raffle lah ah actually yes that is the best lah
boxes are shoes lah obviously behind his bedroom
I I don't have picture but I got see picture before lah ya
he
he I don't know what type of shoes he wears lah but he got the I think the jordans or some stuff like that lah I don't know lah

yo but but it was so clean I was quite amazed like woo
faith in humanity you know
is it tomorrow today ah today lah yes today
err actually I hate that
like want to sit together
but they cannot sit together because
that there got some restaurants they don't allow people to sit they don't allow families to sit together ya cannot
then you split ah three three ah no choice lah
ya
but I hope like
ya for me lah but I hope like they do something like eh okay lah eight people not bad lah
but then I just I just hope you know the
uh huh err
yo but actually duh wah okay so you got anything you want to say before we end sir darwin
there are like thirty seconds left
ah hopefully ah inshaallah amin
okay lah but it's
and I mean it is has been like
it's been very natural right we do it as natural as we can right
it's not it's not scripted or anything for real though it's just

yes
err I'm fine thank you
ya
um I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about um
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me um
ugh
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like err couple
ah redirected to me and then like I I I ask lah hi sir how may I help you
um and so err
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
at your you're risking yourself lah to exposure to virus so
no eating in the store at all you know
rude lah so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like um like we don't have a like um like we are like lower than them
correct ya so err
ya then the day before it was quite funny because um there was this err couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in hey but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then um ya so they were they came in and
err I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like hey why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like err she was like oh like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
mmhmm
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time ah they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards um crane operators err tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
mm mm
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
mmhmm
wah that is late
mm
my alarm lah oh my god
you know that's a typical um an err reaction from old people the audience be like
your mum's friend
okay
mm
mm
mmhmm
correct
mm
aduh
mm mm
that is right
correct
mm
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
mm
mm
alhamdulillah
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share lah we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you lah as of now lah
ya because like I mean like for
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes lah like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like um I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it lah in terms of like
like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not um
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before lah like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like oh my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and um
um for me because um
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home lah which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of err
ya correct mm and then like
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
like you you figure your shit out lah
my mum know lah that he doesn't work lah
that's why she divorce him lah
you know
when I was in err primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long um
since I was in primary two ah I don't know eight years old um now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no lah she remarried and then um she divorced when I was in ya
mm
ya then like alhamdulillah like long time lah but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family lah and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said eh err I'm going to I'm going to the food court lah to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and um
and like he's working
sometimes I really like
like just err pray to god lah alhamdulillah my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know err one funny day err my youngest sister told me she's like
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
when I was working my full time job lah I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so um ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that lah
was to like maybe set up a mm maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him lah even though because at one time lah they wanted to divorce then we we advise them lah like as the older children we advise them to stay together lah if they if they can
why are we born in a poor family
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those err chinese people in society where they say oh I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
um on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
mm
ya so ya I mean I'm
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better lah or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
mm which one the the guy ah
ya that bastard
that is true
ya but like um so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like err what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it lah until the time is up ah
book smart lah
mm
mm
correct
mm
mmhmm
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
mm
mm
mm
it is
mmhmm
ya it's so fast right your time like oh my god
mm
mm
mm
mm
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where um a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like oh I convert
of course
mm
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
mm
oh
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl
ya
ah of course knowing you you would have dressed up
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
ya is your acts right
mm
mm
correct
mm
that's great internship in singapore
mm
mm

okay
so only after that you move back to your parents ah
mm
mm
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum ah
having disputes ah
ah ah ah
mm mm mm
mm
yes
grow up
ya
tense up ah ah
ya ya
fight ah ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing ah ya
ya ya
ya
a'ah
ah
probably probably ya
mm
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear lah ah if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why ah what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside leh you look soft outside and inside you are eh fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it ah
adamant ah
oh okay okay okay
ya
mm
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also lah
ya
mmhmm
ya eh you know what dude actually what right uh one thing you should actually I recommend lah you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book ah dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that eh no no some people actually uh you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique lah then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a wah dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what lah but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good lah
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook ah and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F ah
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel um wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the mats can walk like that or the bengs they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like whoa so big like they as if they got like big triceps ah that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also lah ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
oh really ah
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time lah ah
opening ah ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
a'ah then then then
I I think so ah why ah recall recall recall help me recall
oh ya okay okay then then then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
oi my memory very bad lah bro very bad bro mm
mm
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
ah
ya
ya
okay
something new ah
oo
okay ah
ya ya you can like transfer ah ya
okay
ha
flying ah mm
ah
okay
okay
okay
ya
mm
mm mm mm
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky ah that person should never have been a pilot sia but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
oh eventually they change lah when did they change
okay okay
mm
mm ya ya ya
okay
wah motivated like crazy sia
oh very young ah
ah
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
uh huh

then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit lah ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry lah the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts ah
mm
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal ah
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
mm
wah how many airplanes sia bro like that
wah I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue lah like from steward to be flying lah okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is uh my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
oh you went through the three months ah oh it was supposed to be that stage already lah oh
wah dude that time if you fly ah your inter pretty stable and nice ah bro four to six K easily sia
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike ah
ya ya
walao I don't think that's anywhere close sia
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there sia on the drone
okay
that's relatable lah
ah okay okay so it's just a matter of time lah
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of mumammad salihin
ya then eventually when people see the peak ah lah it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession eh but okay lah but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like oh crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum lah so ya but but but no lah I I wish you all the best ah brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it lah it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field oh
mm
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him ah ya like before him right you see bush wah everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him ah the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman lah
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics ah in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no lah bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back eh okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that lah but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead mah like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks what the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people lah the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have genghis khan you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them lah you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that um people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person lah how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now lah because if I go there I will die of boredom sia
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something lah but I'm not in touch with him that much lah
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old lah I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains ah then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom lah there's nothing to do sia there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know lah okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how sia
a plan ah
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business lah oh I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no lah basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay lah I will just give you a brief verbal presentation ah people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example oh bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why oh why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
ah
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much mah
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility lor
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay lah you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people lah okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole lah which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor lah okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk mah you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan lah okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets lah you know you buy Rolex lah you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there mah
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions lah your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong lah but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example ah they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government uh supreme court order you to pay lah like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone lah that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore ah
cannot ah
their their their passport is blocked what they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead lah you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go lah you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you uh they cannot lah they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay lah they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy ah so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna uh work in production houses if the company feel like eh there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you lor private entity what
ah so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
ah like this kind of job ah the one that is got profile one ah they normally will not hire you one
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system lah ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests ah
ya lah for example okay I give you a scenario ah let's say you owe ten thousand lah the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred lah
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month lah okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial uh the debt trap ah okay so the second way is to pay a minimum eh

hi eh is simon angry at me for making you guys wait

I don't think I can sustain a fucking car

that's bullshit eh babe

oh are you serious
are you serious
can transfer to other people or not
like ya sell your package to someone else
oh
why you still continue to pay sia babe
right
oh my god babe that's a lot of money sia
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put uh a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that oh because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
wah I will angry sia
ya
oh you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
err like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him lah he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like oh
just like
I think it's quite cute lah like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right um the last girlfriend ah he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like oh so like to him it means a lot lah that he ask me then I was like orh okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
um also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with hassan
me I still have unresolved issues with hassan
ya we're still not talking tau babe
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover wah I felt like the shittiest daughter ever sia babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like ah loose threads or like uh consequences on some like those aftermath of me and hassan that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with aqil and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with aqil I want to be with aqil only and not have like oh this is because of hassan that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about hassan like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
take care of himself
I think so ah because like he was a great boyfriend sia babe only things things messed up after the relationship
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year ah
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way sia babe like
like the thing with hassan all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet aqil and this is going to happen
ya
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time ah babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and aqil
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
ya I don't know ah like
I mean I really really hope hassan
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness ah babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship lah after that I don't know what happened
right
uh after after hassan
cause you were still with audi and then like we went out remember you me hassan you me hassan audi ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so eh babe
uh like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like um cold like he's very err like
ah very action ah
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like uh when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then err he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder ah like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
be someone that they're not
then their true form comes out wah scary ah
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
ah
okay
like that would be
babe thailand the best place ya
oh ya you went with your family right
that's nice
I tell my parents I go with you
huh
ah ah
oh right
ya not your thing okay okay I get it
oh my god
bangkok is it
I think it's bangkok right
like
sorry
no lah I think you you and simon should have your time first
you guys should go bali sia babe
no like bali is is accepting like tourists at the end of the year
so you should like
eh they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice nice ass views and the food's pretty good I think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights lah you just have time for each other
just lepak with each other
oh my god they're gonna transcribe this
ya like typing it out like okay so miza um said she and aqil colon
oh right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
then ah
ah ya the the they were in the lot and then like aqil saw them then aqil was like eh and then he park near near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like err Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
huh
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
mm
like his jealousy
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
firdaus is an idiot
ya
you know
we got seven more minutes
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce aqil to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like oh my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like aqil like morals also questionable
like he ah he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
ya
ya
right
mm
your mum
ya
eh how's your mum is she okay
err I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
uh
most likely early next year
or mid next year
but I told him ah like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like oh no lah but like he wants to
then I say it's fine um like we can like plan lah like
try to understand and see other people's view ah like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with

like you know okay just now I saw this job search
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area

to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan lah at least
then after that
okay so
um okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post what
so obviously there's fan
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon eh
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan what
I doubt it will open

ya okay so
err sarah said it's obvious lah and then I was like what do you mean it's obvious
then she said um most most of the time if you go out with your friends you will say the name
but then today you just said you going out then I was like huh
what's mama's problem lah what like why she keeps on calling us like
she said curfew at one so why are you like bothering us around twelve
dude like our curfew is at one
but then you act as it you are the err special child you know like
mm
like mix of both so like there's bad and good lah
like it's zeko's story but then how come zeko
told aisha then end up like mama know you know
huh okay then I was so pissed
so I went to expose one of aisha's secret lah
then after I exposed then after that err my mum was like
illegal gathering lah then I was like okay whatever
err mariam did you tell mama that
then she was like err mizi told me
so apparently she go text aisha eh she go text sarah she said
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
it's just zeko's ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
how to say ah like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
she
she go use my
like
I will throw your nike inside the water
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
err
huh
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
cause
I I won't say it's okay ah but
I don't know lah I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay lor but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm one then
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
no
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and aisha our shoe size is not that
like comfortable
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use lah but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then

so it is good enough for me lah I feel that ah I will prioritize prioritize having money now
ya I guess so I mean
mm
ah
I mean I don't really make a lot of friends in school I mean because of the university ah environment lah like you know people come from different backgrounds and we have different timetables so
we don't really get to see each other that often but I do have one or two few friends lah that I I'm actually looking forward to meeting
and err catching up lah
ya
ah no lah it's my main one lah my main major which is um biological science lah
um
um that
mm mm I I I wanna adventure more into the maritime sector lah and I by maritime you mean the the sea lah
in the future ya
ya
ya
oh
true lah
true
correct correct lah true
ya ya I
we together lah all of us are in a malay club so
ya
so during that
ya commitment issues lah
ya
ah
wah
ya
ya lah ya lah
oh
so ah her malay oral is coming up also so I've been helping her
err with malay oral lah
then err
aside from that
ya I mean the the least I can do is just like be there lah support her and then give her advice
then
ya she she has she seems she seems prepared ah
ya towards the later half of the year lah
same with close to loofy's birthday is it
ah
ya
ya ya nadia tried to err take up err what
the right the arts design and media in
err from the looks of it ah I don't think she got in lah
ya
ah ya the
the something about the diploma I think diploma in teaching
ya kind of sad lah cause she actually turned down her scholarship to try to go for the
ya
ya
ya
mm she's not really interested into like the business kind lah I mean she can do like she encouraged the numbers she can like I think got good numbers lah graphs by by chart tax reform
all those jazz lah ya
ya
I try to
close to that lah similar similar stuff
ya
she will have fallback
ya
ya lah ya ya school starts when ah for you
oh
ya ya my the online semester starts first week of september we having like a welcome ceremony lah on the first of september itself so
it's all virtual lah a bit a bit boring but I mean
ya amsterdam
you know to watch soccer
then you watch people play cricket
true
ya lah not not my not my luck lah
ya
ya
it's getting worse lah in europe area
ya
ya err looking forward to it lah in the future
ah won't be anytime soon lah ya maybe after I get a full time job
after after graduating lah from the university
I almost there lah I feel that already ya
ya
orh
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's err respectable lah for the craft of
ya
mm
ya understandable lah
oh ya ya she she's I think five months
so
time right
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited ah
ya
oh true true
near sharmin's birthday I think
nah who who who I mean
mm government lah they will know that is more than the allowed number ah so
ya it's going to be a small one lah only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
um
ah ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool lah cause they really understands uh their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce ah in the future we work
ah ah ya he's doing fine lah um
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time lah because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during err everyday day to day operations ya
mm
ya ya ya my my dad ah cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed lah beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
cause he's been doing delivery at the site ah to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
mm
ya school fee is quite expensive
mm I think really does a good job lah in ensuring that uh local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years err no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level seh ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five ah
mm
my sorry what
oh my girlfriend ah oh she's she's fine lah because ah she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it lah how ah it's very interesting
so they will err how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
ya ya in that type of uh
effect ya format ya
ah facebook facebook live
then uh she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her uh school of uh
mathematics
err they had a zoom
what they found out from her name ah
ya
I mean ah aren't we all sore losers some days ah
oh uh it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
ah she went out lah with her family cause err
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
I can request lah I mean the idea of contactless kan but
uh I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible lah because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so uh
what to do
ya recently err one of your I think last year is it one of your friends graduated also right
there are what what do you got got for her
ya ya that close friend you met on err ya juliana

he is uh
he's work during our time before A levels ah
and then we ah
ya
ya usually one month also can apply but you want to apply now also can
mm
ya
it's where it's where is the best ah ya
they will still practice social distancing lah ya
ah

mm I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
housing area
ya
ya
ya
ya
ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that ah
oh ya I did err the west ham versus watford right
oh my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
mm
um
ya I mean
it's quite impressive ah that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years ah
oh at any pressure lah
mm
but ya lah I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him lah cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy sia for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya mm I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just just stress ah bro for the last last two games ah
ya correct correct
confirm qualify ah europa europa
ya champions league dah
ah ya lah so that's that lah
quite sad lah cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton ah
ya
mmhmm
ya that is expected of them lah
ya so
but uh you know you know football just football lah
it just a game so
mm
ya
correct correct this ah can't be predicted lah
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
yes
mm
true true true
ya
oh ya speaking of liverpool right so how is uh your good our good friend ah havi
ya
oh
oh the usual springleaf or the prata place ah
mm
ya that's true that's true
wah so you'll be meeting him later ah
oh wow
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my ah regards ah
err like him to know that
I'm always happy for him lah
cause this is like first time in
ah ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
uh that's amazing
ya now he already ya sia he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time ah
ah
how emotion emotional football gets ah
mm
ya true true
but oh wells
oh so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it ah the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme oh the
something to do with like mature mature student or something eh
oh james cook mm
ah okay okay
he but his passion nice lah
under him mah
mm
mm
trainings
mm
ya correct correct
and uh
ya
ya I was at err I was at the and ang mo kio over there ya
ya correct correct
you know drive around the neighbourhood
mm do roundings only ah
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years ah
cause no one from my from my my squad ah actually went to the same ya as me
cause they cause they base you based on your
sorry sorry can you repeat that again ah
err didn't get to hear clearly
mm
ya I would say that central area quite tame mah
ya
whether it's like err important or not ah it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was ah
ya but all in all
okay lah life
valuable lah ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
cause
mm
ya correct correct
mm
true true
ya
ya
but oh well that's
it was a good times ah back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish err
I wish I have plans after this ah but sadly I don't
err you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this err my vicinity lah
correct ah
ah
I usually go for a minimum ten ah
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
ya
mm
oh okay okay
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
now I barely need a sip of water ah
ya
ya correct
mm
ya
the
cause if you drink too much then later your system
it's it's it's hampered with already ah so you need to stay stay clean ah
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
mm
ya correct correct
heatstroke ah heatstroke
mm
correct correct
you more vulnerable to heatstroke lah
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
kan
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
mm
ya
well
uh I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages ah but I've been uh
err a good a very good consumer of like err juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice ah yes you as you as you saying
uh I would say at least
two bottles lah
two bottles err five hundred kind ah
of juices ya correct
mm
mm
ah
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
ah okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits ah
mm
wah
wah that's
I think that's err that's the right way to go ah to be honest
ah
oh serious
then
then is the texture smooth
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable lah but
you need to use a
good blender lah
ya I would say that lah
ya
ah
mm true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
um
but as for
err grapefruit
uh those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit ah
ya
so be smooth ah
sorry grape
ya different different
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut ah
mm
