the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
err
eh you know because it depends on days some days is different but err you err okay wait ya they let me
err cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
tabata but not tabata
but there's a lot of variation in different different
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not
ya
no lah but I think it's part of
okay I I'm gonna keep pushing
but ah ya
twenty five dollars
err per month which is like unlimited bookings is two hundred sixty
ya so for them for people to try out ya for people to try that why
he let like the forty nine dollars lah so but forty nine dollars you can use err train in different different places
oh novena
novena jer ah

err just a disclaimer again because it's not that I
acting or what but but you know I think I don't know I don't have the people over
then there are the ya ya because okay so err like my friend drive
so wait okay my friend drives then the other time the past exercise then we met sharul to
spize lah
crave
err also a disclaimer I'm actually a big eater and I'm just surprised that I don't know what's happening to my brain to not be accepting food

twenty five thirty five minutes total
err yes it's
err okay let's play a game to the listeners
err
our shirt is green in colour
guess
err
okay err like share and subscribe and put it down in the comments below on what you think our
oh is it distracting
no lah it's not
err is it from what you see
no lah it's okay eh why you why you my ear ah
oh you to me wah
constricct constricted or is it restricted
constricted
constricted constrict
restricted
cause okay lah
limited limited edition
okay so what are you what's your plans tomorrow how about that
mm
okay
same until I got C for my malay
no for my H one also I got c
ah
h one C eh
I hope it's accepted to actually talk like this but I think so eh because it's they say is to to talk normally
mahadhir
oh ikmal
wow
ah just saying it's recorded again
okay um
um eh but actually you know I was thinking kan actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line kan
kan you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
err
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if lah I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting lah
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
ya
ya okay
hmm
mm
ah
ah
okay
mm ya ah
ah okay I
err
saying it to the people listening to this err we are currently students and if you have any err
part
ah
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
I was cutting you so
oh twenty seven more minutes
eh that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from eh
just gone
statistics eh
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
I told cause I
err maybe bell curve also lah
no lah but actually is is is helpful for those that
err don't do well eh wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
actually it doesn't help hor
you just fail
oh ya actually he's true ah
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this eh
no nobody can see your forehead
okay ah just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
um
maybe five metres
overhead eh no overhead bridge is four point eight metres oh four point five ah
oh you want to take
class three ya err
okay lah
ah I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips ah
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
that place let's call it um
eh I took my err I would say I took as school students so not private lah
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
err
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard err they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
but I would say the no lah not my age lah
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
I just pick the cheapest lesson lah so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
mm you think you are correct or not
you think
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
ya some more I I was so pissed lah but then
I think at that point I was just still
yes
so the first two times
err it was last year twenty fourth december err because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
err my test and then
err it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
err
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard sharul ya and then I heard sharul ya this year then I heard sharul pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
and then I was
ya then some more
err during my
so my test was err example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this err I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson
I passed it I passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he
he study before he failed then he
he took a break for a few years then he come back no I I didn't compare lah it just that
ya but then now now that I already have license and
now that are ah ah I rented car a few times already
like

but running errands is very tiring
the keyboard

um so how is school these days
ya true
october
you know
um
then
sarah also oh
me and nashrul all meet ah
cause sarah also busy with her
but
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but um now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so um
when your exam start bro
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
for me like for example eh
um I would consider ah because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
exhausting ah like what I see that's why I really
then for me also like my results it's um released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also eh will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like um because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
so like
maths jer for that day so like after that day they will like grade us oh how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want lah of course my expectation is higher
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
then
so like
um
it's okay
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them oh what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure um and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise kan and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me lah then my daily grade from
like it's important subject lah
so ya um
then
for sure but um for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable lah
teacher will give us like uh practice questions to do
eh eleven five nine
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time um
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to um type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before um eh like when you presenting and all
then um for me kan like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
whatever I say kan confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya um
ya
and then
also ya
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
ours
is different seh we like on that day kan the presentation on that day you have to ah prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break lah kan
ya
mm
and it was uh two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
ya
mm
mm no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
eh but for her kan NAFA
really
oh
eh wow I didn't know that
oh my god that's so much friends
seriously
ya
for sure
I'm proud of myself like wow
ya same
same lah as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see um every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
um gone
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family kan is like

I chose electronic engineering
it's because the
one of the basic skills that I can use in uh
my future and basically in life

the food there

like which fast food do you go

err you still go to McDonald's or wait for samurai burger
or any of the shaker fries
what's your favourite menu on McDonald

okay maybe I will
but
in suria
um I don't know if you watched but is a classic drama is a local
uh show
made by suria
no lah uh I'm glad that
Netflix
watch any movie anytime anywhere
uh and you also
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite uh show or anime
so now
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
um
eh um
sorry
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
then uh maybe
grades
and um
uh
so when do you graduate
two years
um
I only left with
four months
um then after four months
then
um just
work
then uh if there's
uh school school uh if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
so it's best for me to work
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about uh
uh money anymore
I
okay with
because uh
but ya
good that uh I have a friend like you
err that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
join rugby
so I've
played rugby
ya so
rugby err
is with me since uh secondary school
and now I'm in a uh club
uh tamoko lions
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
I can see on my uh
meets
ya
uh I recently got injured because of my bad leg
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that uh nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
orh
um when I was young I like extreme sport
um
err then uh
secondary school I go to
err
skatepark and I like skateboarding
uh hopefully that
um
speaking of commitments uh I think
err
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
um I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably err go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news ah fake news
so uh I really want to go karaoke with my friends ah
and for my girlfriend uh probably go out on a date
somewhere uh and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
oh
uh anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
oh ya um actually
err go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
oh uh
um
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go sentosa
uh go beach with my family and
and uh you know swim
um I'm not afraid of heights
are you
um
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
um I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube err like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
uh I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
err when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
um my favourite car is
uh
uh
uh is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
um
my favourite car is mostly uh japanese
for example uh Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
um
tokyo drift is one of them
ah actually
but I only watch till
and I watch uh
way before ah
uh nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because uh he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
err like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
um
and uh the manager himself that uh brought man untied to win uh
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
uh they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win uh all the uh season
and err what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
uh probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya uh um
mm
ya I also
err
go back into the normal state lah
and everybody starts to work normally and uh uh
ya
stick to the uh rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best

oh
ya it was a skillsfuture fund ah ya
mm
err I mean ya lah I mean ah when I was with
with my uncle at my uncle's shop right
uh start to
ya still one year ya so total is one year lah plus
the the barber life ah barber life is um
quite unhealthy lah you smoke then you drink sugary drinks sweet drinks then
wait about customer then you got customer then you will cut your hair wait then cut their hair then after that
um audio audio engineering job lah because
eh but but honestly singapore
all most of the position are taken taken up already and now because like like
like this situation like COVID situation
there's not many uh studio recording jobs lah so unless you're really lucky then you get a studio where
you know they need somebody to intern or something then you will
you will get the job lah if not
you it's quite difficult to find find a audio engineering job lah
studio engineer job lah like recording engineer job inside the studio lah
err there's a lot of jobs like that but it's tiring lah ya that one every week you can get that kind of job just that it's
it's tiring lah but the the real job that I really want is to
to record for artist inside the studio lah that one I really have to find lah ya
err lah universal music and all that lah so a lot of those jobs are take up already so
err mediacorp lah mediacorp suria maybe suria but I I'm also quite sure there's already a
there's already an audio audio main audio person there main audio engineer there
was a weekday was on a wednesday so I I got a class lah I got classes in the afternoon

ya three four days ah usually nowadays so monday and friday usually got no school
pbb err ya lah I mean now
ya ya nothing nothing much to look forward to
nowadays lah like I I really want to travel lah I really want to save money and
and travel lah so ya lah a lot a lot you cannot do a lot of things right now lah
mm you know during COVID so
ya so all I can do is is find job right now ah the the last
they're talking about talking about my uh barbering job and all that I
I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that lah so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought um monday since since uh like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay lah the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night lah night shift like I can work from eleven to
err eleven to I think
seven ah seven seven eleven near
near my house lah near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny leh I I didn't
I didn't get a reply ah they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get seh I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job kan
ah yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're err ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so ah it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier lah so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which uh which location you prefer
then
huh
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call lah then they so far never call they're taking quite some time ah I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true lah true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that err right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that um
some people are not really serious about the job lah they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point lah so
that's what my mother said lah then I I think I think quite
true lah like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
err I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they ah um
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
err diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary lah a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs lah so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya lah of course lah I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like um if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time lah I will I will do mm
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently lah I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up lah definitely like um
ya getting easily more tired or you know like um
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different lah when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like um oh I'm the best I can do
oh I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
um you realize
you're not really the best ah other people better than you or then you
you start to ya lah it's a different thing lah
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also lah different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya lah different different privileges
yes
correct lah actually actually true lah I I
ah I know I mean the the the thing is that because err right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk lah I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
ah nicely have respect for elders but
huh I don't know about the the the the current um I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all lah some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have um respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job lah teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people lah so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them lah like um
like old old people old values lah old values like like um
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya lah it's it's all a small thing lah at the moment mm ya
mm
maybe ah because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay lah that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
mm
pass very fast lah for me so
so a'ah lah
was more relaxed lah more
laid back chill ya
so um
COVID I mean
mm
apocalypse no lah
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing ah nothing much lah
I I was just trying to get along earn money lah you know ya
ya
oh okay okay okay ya the first the very first um
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one lah phase one circuit breaker was
was ya lah it's a bit a bit um
a bit stressful lah stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
oh circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like ah I I don't care lah I will still go out lah I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that lah I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing lah then I I
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing lah so it's not like
just go out you know like
um
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also lah
ya
weird lah you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly um
hmm
mm
ya mm definitely different
different time lah you know err nobody
nobody expected this to happen lah so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed lah that time they a lot of people stressed err a lot of uh
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry lah then
because ya
so
