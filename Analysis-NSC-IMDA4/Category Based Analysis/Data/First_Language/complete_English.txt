[ah] no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had (um) indonesian <malay>punya</malay> maid so sometimes ya
ya
(uh) ya ya ya so actually (um) like last time my maid <malay>selalu</malay> (um) talk to me in in <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia <malay>macam</malay> I know how ya how to speak ya (hmm)
sorry
(um) actually it just <malay>baru baru</malay> start so <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> just had like briefing then (uh) so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya
I see I see ya
(hmm)
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> health actually quite important [lah] (um) ya I <malay>rasa macam</malay> when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy <malay>macam</malay> what's the what's the point what's the point <malay>kalau kau pergi kerja</malay> everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy [lah] for your good for your health and stuff like that
same [lah] <malay>sama sama</malay> ya is is I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite common <malay>gitu</malay> to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
(um)
<malay>dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun</malay> in
you <malay>kerja</malay> [oh] so <malay>baru</malay> graduate also
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh]
<malay>dari dari</malay>
from which from which uni
[oh] sorry sorry from poly is it
okay okay
(hmm)
I see I see
[oh] drama side drama side <malay>macam buat apa</malay> like day to day like what is it like
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> entertainment <malay>untuk dia punya budak-budak</malay> that kind of thing [lah]
I see I see
(hmm)
okay okay
(hmm) so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company <malay>macam</malay> allows you to to to to take breaks in between [lah]
(mm) <malay>dia</malay> (mm) okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> like some some of us <malay>yang baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that <malay>macam</malay> when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like <malay>macam</malay> is it a mismatch of expectations <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> you thought it would be something else
(hmm)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) actually good good that your boss <malay>macam</malay> I recognize that you you need to take a break then (um) then <malay>kalau</malay> when you're better than you can always <malay>balik</malay> go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me (uh) ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I work for <malay>dua tahun</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) I tried <malay>dua</malay> company <malay>tapi macam</malay> (uh) at the same time it felt different <malay>tapi macam</malay> same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> if it's the industry <malay>punya</malay> issue or <malay>kalau</malay> I need to change industry <malay>atau</malay> change company ya <malay>macam</malay> that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to <malay>macam</malay> take a break and then (um) from there I explored different different <malay>punya</malay> industry and then (um) at the same time I <malay>kerja</malay> part time then (um) <malay>macam</malay> trying to at the same time I explore [lah] whether I feel <malay>nak</malay> stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough [lah] one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right <malay>macam</malay> you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya
correct
(mm)
ya at least some more now <malay>macam</malay> it's COVID <malay>punya</malay> period then then <malay>nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah</malay> then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
(mm)
it's something better than <malay>macam</malay> nothing right
(mm)
ya ya ya I think to be honest <malay>macam</malay> singaporean man a bit cautious or like became <malay>fikir banyak sangat</malay> of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then <malay>kalau</malay> doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so <malay>macam</malay> just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so <malay>macam</malay> at every ya every <malay>setiap pagi</malay> I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for <malay>macam tiga jam</malay> [jer] then (um) <malay>ada</malay> assignment then (um) some project ya just learning new things I guess
[oh] the the webinar is actually (uh) era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's <malay>enam enam bulan</malay> then ya at the same time they are <malay>macam</malay> giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya <malay>tapi</malay> those (hmm) <malay>tu</malay> actually <malay>untuk</malay> mid career adults [lah] <malay>macam</malay> those that <malay>ada</malay> work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new [lah] I guess ya
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tak payah</malay> because everyday <malay>macam</malay> is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
(hmm)
ya
but how <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
[oh] okay okay
(hmm) okay I see I see I see <malay>sebab dia</malay> what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
(hmm)
okay
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh] that's (hmm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> overload of things to to do right do you feel
<malay>tapi</malay> what about the your your other work <malay>punya</malay> colleagues like do they feel the same way
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
I see I see
I see
that's true
(hmm) sounds very challenging [lah] <malay>macam susah</malay> so
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment [lah] so I started taking (um) (um) I started joining this financial advisory <malay>punya</malay> company then <malay>dia orang</malay> give like trainings (um) to to prepare us [lah] <malay>macam</malay> how to how to like you know prospect for clients <malay>macam</malay> how to (um) basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I <malay>rasa</malay> sales <malay>punya</malay> skill is quite important <malay>macam</malay> in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or <malay>kalau</malay> be it ideas or products to anybody [lah] so so I <malay>rasa macam</malay> it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn <malay>macam susah</malay> to <malay>macam</malay> convince people (um) to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process [lah] I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
(hmm) I <malay>macam baru</malay> start meeting clients that (um) (uh) there are some (um) potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that [ah] ya
so (um) other than that <malay>macam</malay> I think you what you said about (um) an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive (um) like make you <malay>macam</malay> want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess <malay>tapi macam</malay> I haven't actually (um) had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then (um) for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to <malay>macam</malay> earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense <malay>macam</malay> or even though <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy <malay>macam</malay> ya like I don't <malay>bangun tak rasa macam</malay> stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work <malay>macam</malay> you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this <malay>macam</malay> how I felt [lah] everyday after after work last time like you <malay>balik rumah macam tak ada</malay> mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
[oh] man ya that feels like me
ya I think it's common like <malay>macam</malay> I spoke to my <malay>kawan</malay> my friends <malay>dia orang pun macam rasa</malay> the same the same thing [lah] ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
(hmm) yes yes yes
(mm)
(mm)
then you got try <malay>macam</malay> try company company <malay>lain tak</malay> like because <malay>ini</malay> your first job [kan]
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether <malay>macam</malay> is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
(hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
but you said you did the conversion
(mmhmm)
I see I see so this is like the conversion thing you're talking about [lah] [oh] okay
(mm)
ya
(hmm)
is it you are supporting financially <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>dia boleh</malay> pay for <malay>dia punya</malay> own things like [oh] is it difficult
(mm)
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay (um) so (um) ya it's really <malay>macam</malay> it's I think <malay>sekarang</malay> we're in a very difficult <malay>punya</malay> position <malay>pasal</malay> there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
[oh] you are twenty only [oh] sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my <malay>mak</malay> and my my dad don't pressure me [lah] like because ya even though I'm already twenty five <malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> they know it's not easy [lah] our time to like they said last last time by twenty five <malay>dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak</malay> you know that kind of thing but they but they don't <malay>macam</malay> push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think [ah] <malay>macam syukur</malay> [lah] like I feel quite
not stressed at home which is great [lah] because some people feel stressed at work and at home you know that another thing ya so I'm thankful for that ya I'm thankful for that at least ya
[oh] I know what that means ya
[eh] same same ya
same same
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh]
(mm) I see ya I think <malay>macam</malay> same my family <malay>macam</malay> not very affectionate also when growing up what <malay>macam</malay> don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
ya I think it's common more common that you think but like at the same time it's not that great not something to be proud of ya ya
(mm)
you <malay>ada</malay> connections with like theatre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
no time is it like no (hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I know what you mean actually I'm also seeing someone then I also feel a bit down like but even though even though like I don't really talk about it like ya I do worry about like what what I'm whether I'm doing enough at the moment kind of thing ya so I think is understandable what you feel I've totally get it ya
ya I get it
(mm)
(um) actually <malay>macam</malay> I just told him I am exploring something new [lah] while because like at the same time also (um) learning like <malay>macam tengah belajar</malay> new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so <malay>macam</malay> I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
(um)
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything [lah] like I can pay for my own things like I <malay>ada</malay> savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that [lah] like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like <malay>ada ada</malay> like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
(mm) ya
[oh]
ya
ya I think <malay>macam</malay> having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace [lah] it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> it you make you look forward to <malay>nak pergi kerja</malay> you look forward to seeing them
[oh] [oh]
okay
[oh] okay
[oh]
ya #irritatingnya#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
then <malay>dia orang dia orang tak bayar</malay> (hmm)
[oh] that sucks
(hmm) [oh] you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like <malay>macam mana</malay> like how does it work
(hmm)
(hmm)
is it I didn't know
ya and then (um) ya so (um) ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) so little
[oh] so october is now
so what do you think <malay>macam</malay> you want to try <malay>ke</malay> you don't want <malay>ke</malay>
at the same time (um) I <malay>rasa</malay> like while we're still young important to save also [lah] saving is quite important ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> since since I was young [kan] I always believe in saving then <malay>macam</malay> I am quite thrifty [lah] <malay>macam</malay> and like <malay>macam tak</malay> spendthrift <malay>sangat</malay> so like I made sure to to have enough savings [lah] so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
ya
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh] but
(hmm) [oh] I thought I thought [oh] okay
<malay>tapi</malay> you got you got try <malay>macam</malay> apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood <malay>tak</malay>
[oh] ya ya that's why you already started already
[oh] but now is the intake right you said october you just check <malay>macam</malay> apply for fun [lah] like what's what's it there's nothing to lose <malay>kalau</malay> you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right (hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
ya <malay>tapi</malay> you can just tell her later [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> that you you're but you're officially left right you said
[oh]
<malay>tapi ada</malay> notice period <malay>tu semua</malay> [lah]
[oh] <malay>kenapa</malay>
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
then <malay>kalau kalau</malay> you leave you must <malay>bayar dia punya</malay> six thousand <malay>ke tak</malay> like it like if you do finally decide
[oh] that's good
<malay>tapi macam</malay> you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then <malay>kalau tak</malay> then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
(hmm)
[oh] so sorry
[oh]
I totally get it get it ya
okay actually I <malay>ada kawan yang</malay> just started the early childhood she also was from engineering <malay>punya</malay> field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about <malay>dia punya</malay> program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
ya
can later I will give you her number ya then (um)
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so <malay>dia</malay> totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not <malay>macam</malay> out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya <malay>macam</malay> some ya ya ya that feeling what's <malay>segan</malay> to us just sometimes that feel that way <malay>tapi</malay> actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience <malay>macam</malay> whatever you have experience [lah] then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
then can maybe made you look forward to something better and maybe she can even recommend you to her company you know you never know
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least <malay>macam</malay> [lah] like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry [lah] then at least you roll one out
ya
yup I'll text her later I'll text her later than I'll give you her number she's a very nice person ya
can you hear me can you hear me
[oh] I hope our recording is not affected recording is not wifi [kan]
(hmm) ya
[oh] I
okay okay
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
[oh]
okay okay
ya
ya ya she's very nice she's very nice ya
so actually I met her from (um) like a random <malay>punya</malay> part time job also then <malay>macam</malay> we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and <malay>macam</malay> after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya <malay>macam</malay> random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
ya okay so maybe hopefully after that it will help you [lah] I just wanted to like try help you a little bit but don't know whether it will help ya
ya
no worries okay
I don't know I think <malay>macam</malay> I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of <malay>macam</malay> thought into it it's not <malay>macam</malay> a fleeting decision like I was really <malay>macam</malay> very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my <malay>punya</malay> bosses all like understand [lah] like my work was difficult [lah] like I was facing a difficult <malay>punya</malay> client <malay>macam</malay> everyday <malay>hentam</malay> on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
so
at the same time <malay>macam</malay> as in like I said [lah] because I had <malay>macam</malay> savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important [lah] like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
ya so like
(hmm) important to save [ah]
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing [lah] ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing [lah] like take a break and not work kind of thing
(hmm) so
(hmm)
(hmm)
good for you [lah]
sure
(hmm)
[oh] no
(hmm)
why
[oh] probation [ah] <malay>macam sekarang sekarang</malay> is probation period is it
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> contract what the contract say
then you actually you can demand for that you know
(uh)
no but your contract said you have so actually <malay>macam</malay> you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
(hmm)
you mean [oh]
that sucks though
(hmm) ya that ya
[oh] ya
you have do you have siblings like you <malay>ada kakak</malay> or <malay>adik</malay> like
[oh] only one <malay>kakak</malay> [lah]
!huh! sorry [oh] see I see okay ya I'm also not <malay>tak tak</malay> not close to my siblings my elder siblings too <malay>pasal dia orang dah</malay> marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common [lah]
(hmm)
so (um) I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like <malay>macam</malay> sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
ya
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that (hmm) that is so important <malay>macam</malay> not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
ya
(hmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to <malay>macam</malay> cafe where <malay>dia punya</malay> server is so friendly like <malay>dia</malay> bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending <malay>dia punya</malay> food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
but ya hopefully you find something that makes you happy that's quite as in even if it's not happy doesn't make you unhappy ya
or maybe like if you do need help to like have you consulted like polyclinic to get referral to doctors
[oh] you have already that's good because I have friends who did the same
no what's that
(hmm)
tapi dia punya</malay> fees what about the fees

interesting that happen yesterday
(err) I booked for ten thirty class
for F forty five at #novena# shout out to F forty five #novena#
K (err) <malay>abeh lepas tu aku</malay> we attend (err) we attend the ten thirty class and then
we realise (err) like my friend <malay>pergi tanya</malay> the instructor [lah] then instructor said
the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
<malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>semua aku punya badan tengah</malay> ya back to back it's really very tiring
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> it's more of like
(err)
[eh] you know because it depends on days some days is different but (err) you (err) okay wait ya they let me
put it in words ya <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay> word
(err) cause it's recorded
I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
disclaimer it's just to okay I think maybe I should but it's just like you do work out then you rest then you do workout rest workout rest <malay>macam</malay> I think it's more it's like
#tabata# but not #tabata#
but there's a lot of variation in different different
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday I went to station four I did like a certain workout and then I went to station seven at the second lesson and then I did another set of workout which is totally different and then
ya that's why I I like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody <malay>macam</malay> just doing their own <malay>apa ni</malay> doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
(err) just walk around and then <malay>dia kata</malay>
come on guys let's do it <malay>gitu aku macam tak</malay> it's it's more of like an australian accent
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not

I don't know but but at at least quite nice but when when when I was doing it [kan] the like <malay>dia cakap</malay> come on guys let's do it or something <malay>macam</malay> like along the lines and then she's like hydrate yourself and then <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay I I'm gonna keep pushing

twenty five dollars
(err) per month which is like unlimited bookings is two hundred sixty
ya so for them for people to try out ya for people to try that why

I don't know whether they're doing it for I don't know whether they are doing it for your for your monday's one [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
it's quite cool mean meaning like <malay>macam kau</malay> imagine like currently you are just having normal conversation with a random stranger then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] you just like
<malay>menyeleweng</malay> it's not is it <malay>menyeleweng</malay> no <malay>menyeleweng</malay> is like out of topic [ah] you out of topic and then some times out of topic they can use that ideas to
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk

what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from [eh]
just gone
ya [eh] actually ya I forgot everything you know you know <malay>yang</malay> the last time <malay>kita buat</malay>
statistics [eh]
[eh] <malay>aku bagus gila</malay> [sia] I think like I can !chey!
[ah] P <malay>abeh lepas tu ada</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> data
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
(mm) I was quite good at it <malay>tapi</malay>
[eh] pure maths <malay>aku pun</malay> okay <malay>tapi tak tahu kenapa dapat</malay> B [oh] I miss out one question
I told cause I
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
cause I told my teacher [eh] I I skipped one question I don't know how to do <malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] once you skip one question you confirm can not get A
<malay>agaknya gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>agaknya dorang mark</malay> [eh] !oi!
!alamak! all correct but one question wrong <malay>sekali dua</malay> question <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>dua</malay> question
two mark question is wrong and then they sorry [ah] B but <malay>babi</malay>
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
like <malay>macam</malay> how do I say [ah]
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
<malay>macam</malay> normally you are just a fifty fifty fifty out of hundred student
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
<malay>matlamat matlamat</malay>
<malay>maklumat</malay> information [ah]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres
overhead [eh] no overhead bridge is four point eight metres [oh] four point five [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
[oh] you want to take
class three ya (err)
okay [lah]
[ah] I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips [ah]
<malay>boleh faham</malay> I take it there
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
our shit [oh] !oops! sorry for saying the S word <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh] I took my driving <malay>kat</malay>
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] I took my (err) I would say I took as school students so not private [lah]
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
just so that my group is with all the <malay>pakcik pakcik</malay> [ah] I cannot take it like okay there's a few <malay>yang</malay> like <malay>macam muda muda</malay>
but I would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
I just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
<malay>dia kata</malay>
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
(err) you think you correct (err) you should should drive faster you should <malay>gini gitu gitu gitu tapi aku macam</malay> dude I'm just learning and then if you're not gonna teach me or tell me why I am wrong
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
<malay>nak</malay>
ya some more I I was so pissed [lah] but then
I think at that point I was just still
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't I don't argue over !aiya! just <malay>sabar</malay> patience patience
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] overall but overall I would say (err) cause I the last (err) I took my like (err) test like four times
so the first two times
(err) first two times I was bad in the circuit then I failed the third time I went out <malay>tapi</malay>
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
can I got eighteen points but then because of that one immediate failure I fail the whole test so I <malay>merajuk sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay>
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard #sharul# ya and then I heard #sharul# ya this year then I heard #sharul# pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then #sharul# [ah] #sharul# took two weeks before me then I met up with him for dinner he said [oh] he pass already then <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then I'm like !wah! so good [ah]
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
like it's already my fourth time [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> like [oh] <malay>penat nya</malay>
and then I was
(err) <malay>dia sekolah</malay> [eh] private private
ya then some more
(err) during my
so my test was (err) example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this (err) I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson
<malay>sebab aku macam takut gila</malay> but then monday I just went to the place and then I
I passed it I passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he
he study before he failed then he
he took a break for a few years then he come back no I I didn't compare [lah] it just that
because I'm like [eh] !wah! he got it [eh] I also <malay>macam</malay> I want to [lah] because I really want to drive
ya but then now now that I already have license and
now that are [ah] [ah] I rented car a few times already

we we are in the same school <malay>apa kau berbual</malay>
same faculty we are in the same school
do you know we are in we are actually in the same school
school of science
but it's just that you are majoring in different courses
majoring in different
<malay>kau apa</malay> life science [eh]
<malay>kehidupan</malay> science
is it what is life sciences life sciences
science <malay>kehidupan</malay>
science
I want to say sorry please please accept please accept us for who we are and what we talk about
we are students
[eh] you know you got sorry I I just want to say to you [eh] I got offered okay [lah] my friend <malay>yang kerja kat</malay> raffles <malay>dulu</malay> she !wah! I was so touched you know like like yesterday <malay>dia tiba-tiba</malay> texted me say #izwal# (err) cause I ask her before <malay>dia ada</malay> slot <malay>tak kat tempat kerja dia kerja</malay> [lah] then she say don't have then
!huh! <malay>bukan</malay> it's just normal clinic clinic because she work in a clinic
then
<malay>semalam dia</malay> text me then she said [oh] my her her friend from another organisation
has spot
for like vacancy for application [ah] for job application
then [eh] I went to email the person you know okay but I don't know whether I get it or not because the person hasn't reply yet
but [ah] (err) the working hours is on weekdays but it's a twelve hour shift [ah] so probably I can only work
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] actually saturday sunday <malay>pun</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> because next sem is like
<malay>apa</malay> in at online right so I will be spending most of my time at home so like just to compensate a little bit or <malay>kalau</malay> if there's more space you want one one slot
<malay>aku ambil</malay> saturday <malay>kau ambil</malay> sunday ya
<malay>tak nak</malay>
[ah]
[oh] north area
you talking but I also don't know how much it it it is [lah] but given that it's at

<malay>apa</malay>
like
(err) actually it's like multi roles [lor] <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>kita dulu kat kerja</malay>
but it's multi role ya it's a lot of multi like registration
ya it's it's like a lot of multi role so I guess
I know [ah] okay
!alah! you should get it given that
you know what actually you should just get it's christmas

<malay>kau merepek</malay>
woody sanction
(mm)
wait sorry I cannot hear you can you repeat again
ya I know you got cut a bit okay
testing testing one two three [eh] [eh] okay okay [dah] [dah] [dah]
ya ya can can
to cope with the lesson
no I was just thinking okay because my main rationale [kan] was I I mean I could have sign a bond with like hospital <malay>tapi</malay> my main rationale behind not signing a bond because I don't wanna decide on myself too too early because I'm still year one
and then I rather use this time as an experience you know
like compare to my friends that actually sign a bond like you know
this maybe this one year that they they're actually getting allowance and everything
while they are actually getting allowance and not be able to work outside I'm currently working outside gaining that experience so it's like a headstart as compared to them
then somemore I'm like taking like
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean hospital hospital [lah] but then different hospital is different ways of like
<malay>apa ni</malay> work style environment right so I am trying to trying to like keep my options open for now first [lah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> sign to a place [ah] then <malay>menyesal</malay>
regret
ya I don't want to regret
sign on <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
sign on <malay>kena</malay> [eh] no [eh] [ah] I think sign on I will be a nursing officer
yes I am with I think I think so I don't know
but I must go through you know I must go through [eh]
it's tiring dude
ya it just
you just no stop that that life is over
until they call you back until they call you back
until they call you back you know
fun
really
!wah! I they I don't even know my unit yet
[oh] four more minutes four more minutes four more minutes !woo!
<malay>sekali</malay> eight dollars stuck coffee bean
and I only get sixteen dollars [eh] sixteen seventeen dollars
how much is it ya
you know
eight plus twelve is how much eighteen
[eh] twenty got five dollars left

unfortunately unfortunately
<malay>tak apa</malay> it's okay good things await for those who
are patient

(um) so how is school these days
ya true
so my school starts actually for now it's like (um) <malay>tengah</malay> holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october
october nineteen <malay>tu pun</malay> now is just only like semester one [jer] <malay>belum</malay> semester two then like it's still like year one so
<malay>macam</malay> I feel like year one <malay>ni lama gila</malay>
you know
(um)
then
ya my friends also like <malay>nak ajak</malay> hang out also my friend you know sarah
she <malay>ada</malay> club so she sarah and #nasrul# <malay>ni</malay> (uh) both of them is club is school of applied science <malay>punya</malay>
[ah] is more like your own course <malay>habis</malay> is more of like leadership <malay>punya</malay> kind of
then (um) <malay>tak salah</malay>
sarah also [oh]
sarah have like (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> event [ah] for their (um) for their so she's the one that like <malay>macam</malay> like overall in charge
so <malay>ada ada</malay> (um) <malay>ada ada</malay> groups <malay>yang kena buat</malay> event <malay>tu</malay> one is her group <malay>kena pilih</malay> another one is another group <malay>tapi nashrul punya</malay> group like (um) <malay>tak kena</malay> chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week <malay>baru</malay> like we
me and #nashrul# all meet [ah]
cause sarah also busy with her
but
I also have my own <malay>tapi tak apa lagi</malay> <malay>pasal malas</malay>
ya <malay>pasal malas</malay>
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but (um) now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
<malay>kita kena pergi sekolah balik</malay>
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so (um)
when your exam start bro
honestly I respect those people <malay>yang macam dia orang sudah</malay> like for two years
and then doing the same thing that <malay>budak</malay> poly <malay>buat</malay> then having to go through the same thing like for another three years <malay>kat</malay> poly it's just so tiring and exhausting [ah] that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>selepas</malay> they choose to just work
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
<malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
for me like for example [eh]
poly [kan] <malay>macam</malay> also is like poly so like I feel like <malay>macam ni</malay> poly example I take it as [eh] having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
(um) I would consider [ah] because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
it's not like <malay>macam</malay> easy you know like for those people who really like (um)
<malay>buat</malay> the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
exhausting [ah] like what I see that's why I really
salute those people who <malay>macam</malay> have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to (um) poly ya
then for me also like my results it's (um) released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also [eh] will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like (um) because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
phase is just (um) submitting your diploma ranking course [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah [kan] <malay>dia dapat</malay> interview so <malay>dia</malay> pass interview and then she already get her what [ah] her results that like she can go in like like her place for
(um) pharmaceutical science <malay>memang sudah</malay> chop chop for her so macam</malay> okay [lah] she <malay>sudah selamat</malay> she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because <malay>dia memang</malay> can already it's like
so <malay>macam kalau</malay> interview <malay>sudah</malay> pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all [lah]
but for me because my interview <malay>tak dapat</malay>
so like
now focus solely on which is (uh) <malay>kita orang</malay> <malay>pasal kita orang tak ada</malay> exam also so they look
over (um) they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day <malay>macam</malay> for us [kan] <malay>ada orang</malay> like
(um) <malay>sekolah dia orang satu hari</malay> is like is combination of subjects but for me is like <malay>kalau</malay> math is
maths [jer] for that day so like after that day they will like grade us [oh] how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want [lah] of course my expectation is higher
then after that <malay>kalau</malay> there's a mixture of A and B is <malay>banyak</malay> and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like (um) three to four
<malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>kalau macam</malay> C <malay>banyak gitu</malay> then maybe around two point five to three point five <malay>gitu</malay> then (um)
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
like <malay>baru berapa</malay> compared to my other two friend I think they did more better [lah] in a sense
then
so like
(um)
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech <malay>memang nak</malay> try <malay>dapat</malay> biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like <malay>mati-mati nak</malay> biomedical science [jer] like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
it's okay
but the thing he <malay>tak</malay> put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense [lah] cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them [oh] what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure (um) and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise [kan] and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me [lah] then my daily grade from
biology also <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> A
A <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard [lah] cause it's the (um) they focus (um) on biology the most
like it's important subject [lah]
so ya (um)
then
so like this semester <malay>tak ada</malay> exam so I next semester <malay>ada</malay> exam
for sure but (um) for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable [lah]
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay <malay>pasal</malay> assignment <malay>dia pun</malay> is
<malay>tak banyak</malay> like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day [kan] like through read virtually like other then after that (um)
teacher will give us like (uh) practice questions to do
<malay>habis ada</malay> quiz <malay>juga</malay> that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
[eh] eleven five nine
then the practice question is like <malay>biasa macam</malay> homework <malay>gitu</malay>
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time (um)
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to (um) type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
mostly <malay>banyak</malay> presentation but it's good [lah]
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm (um) when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages <malay>pasal</malay> like I think you will feel like
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before (um) [eh] like when you presenting and all
then (um) for me [kan] like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
<malay>kalau</malay> I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu [kan] is just like my weakness like
whatever I say [kan] confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya (um)
ya
and then
also ya
then <malay>pasal</malay> presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [lah] but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates <malay>yang</malay>
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
ours
is different [seh] we like on that day [kan] the presentation on that day you have to [ah] prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation <malay>punya tu</malay>
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break [lah] [kan]
ya
(mm)
and it was (uh) two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
sometimes I'm like !wow! <malay>kita dah</malay> eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near (um) uniforms so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old [lah] then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay> actually it's normal <malay>macam biasa</malay> like !wow! it's just normal [lah] honestly
ya
(mm)
and it's okay cause <malay>macam tak ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] it's okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we don't really take that into my mind <malay>macam</malay> [oh] like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like <malay>keluar</malay> dates with you know I think
I don't really mind [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I have a boyfriend or not as long as <malay>macam</malay> that is like (um) <malay>kawan dekat</malay> you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me <malay>pasal</malay> later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
(mm) no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
[eh] but for her [kan] NAFA
NAFA is like [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
really
[oh]
[eh] !wow! I didn't know that
[oh] my god that's so much friends
seriously
like different people also like different [lah] honestly like (um) the things that they're prioritising and it's all like <malay>semua ada masing-masing</malay> [lah] <malay>hanya</malay>
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of worries like [oh] <malay>pasal duit</malay> and all that of course you want your family to be <malay>macam</malay> stable [lah] like in every (um) ya in everything you know
ya
it's very hard [lah] like I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> family <malay>tak cannot like <malay>tak tak ada</malay> like stability and all that [kan] I feel like [ah] one day confirm will fall apart <malay>punya</malay>
for sure
and some more I also like the type of person <malay>yang tak</malay> message <malay>orang</malay>
like !wow! <malay>kalau dah malas dia punya malas</malay> is <malay>malas tak aku boleh</malay> like
for one week straight <malay>tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa</malay> cause like I'm that type of person [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !wah! like heartbreak this heartbreak <malay>gila babi</malay> you know like that kind
but then like !wah! like <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
I'm proud of myself like !wow!
but even though like there are times <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam nak ada orang</malay> like to be by your side like a boyfriend [lah] okay <malay>kirakan</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
<malay>kita boleh</malay> get over it [lah] there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
ya same
same [lah] as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see (um) every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
(um) gone
so like sometimes <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] <malay>ada</malay> family gathering [kan] it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something [ah] even my sister like
like (uh) video call her friends during [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm having a dinner so I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay [lah] <malay>kalau ada kawan tu</malay> okay but then like <malay>kalau</malay> it's time to like for your family you focus on your family [jer] <malay>tak mahu</malay> get mixed [lah] like video call with friends like
other time you can do [what] like <malay>kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang</malay> like <malay>jumpa kawan habis kat rumah</malay> also like <malay>kawan</malay> then like when are you going to like you know (um)
(mm) spend time with your family not really ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family [kan] is like
!wow! I'm lucky to be in such a family kind <malay>punya</malay> vibes cause different family different [ah] <malay>ada</malay> family like focus (um)
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future <malay>kalau nak ada family</malay> I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then <malay>kalau</malay> like my <malay>anak-anak macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>ke</malay> girlfriend <malay>ke aku macam nak bagi</malay> advice <malay>sikit</malay>

(uh) and you also
can watch your favourite anime <malay>tapi</malay> depends [ah]
sometimes not all the show that you want <malay>ada dekat dalam</malay>
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite (uh) show or anime
so now
<malay>apa cerita</malay> you <malay>tengok dekat</malay>
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
<malay>tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun makan</malay>
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
yes so <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> my class start at eight
(um)
the latest that I arrive <malay>paling lambat</malay> I think <malay>pukul lapan</malay>
[eh] (um)
sorry
<malay>sepuluh</malay>
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
<malay>tapi</malay> I will try my best to come school early next time
then (uh) maybe
<malay>cuba juga</malay> improve my
grades
and (um)
now I have a lot of projects so <malay>tengah nak habiskan semua</malay>
(uh)
so when do you graduate
two years
<malay>lama</malay> [seh]
(um)
I only left with
four months
(um) then after four months
I think <malay>nak</malay> apply <malay>kerja</malay>
then
(um) just
work
then (uh) if there's
(uh) school school (uh) if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari duit</malay>
so it's best for me to work
(err) <malay>bulan depan</malay>
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about (uh)
(uh) money anymore
I
okay with
<malay>apa-apa</malay> you <malay>cakap tadi</malay> [ah]
because (uh)
<malay>dalam masa depan pun</malay> I think will continue my studies
but ya
good that (uh) I have a friend like you
(err) that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
<malay>apa</malay> you join
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
<malay>tak tak tahu kenapa</malay> also I join then when I was sec three
my <malay>kawan</malay> (uh) all <malay>ajak</malay> me go
join rugby
and that's where I grew my interest <malay>dengan</malay> rugby
so I've
played rugby
<malay>dah masuk sepuluh tahun</malay>
ya so
rugby (err)
is with me since (uh) secondary school
and now I'm in a (uh) club
(uh) #tamoko# lions
I <malay>anggap</malay> rugby as a
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
whenever <malay>nak pergi</malay> training
I can see on my (uh)
meets
ya
(uh) I recently got injured because of my bad leg
so <malay>bila kaki tu</malay> injured
(uh) <malay>kena pergi</malay> doctor
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that (uh) nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
[orh]
(um) when I was young I like extreme sport
(um)
so <malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>kecil tu</malay> my bicycle
<malay>tapi</malay> is not your normal bicycle is like
(err) then (uh)
secondary school I go to
(err)
skatepark and I like skateboarding
so <malay>daripada situ</malay> I pick up (uh) skateboarding also
so I play <malay>dengan</malay> skateboard together
(uh) hopefully that
<malay>tak ada</malay> break any bones because I want to continue playing
<malay>dengan</malay> skateboard and also maybe hopefully
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> [lah] (um) play rugby in another ten years
(um)
speaking of commitments (uh) I think
(err)
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
we live our life together <malay>sama-sama</malay> in <malay>dalam satu rumah</malay> happily
(um) I think
they are having confusion about phase three
<malay>tapi</malay> I hope that phase three is coming soon because <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak mahu cakap pasal</malay> mask
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
<malay>dalam bas</malay>
then when you breathe and there's fog <malay>dekat cermin mata</malay>
you know how terrible that is
I can't wear contact lens <malay>takut</malay>
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
<malay>bila</malay>
my <malay>kawan</malay> like
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
I <malay>pun tak sabar nak</malay> (uh) <malay>habiskan ini</malay> COVID
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably (err) go out in an adventure
ya <malay>sedih bila dengar</malay> Teo Heng is closing down
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news [ah] fake news
so (uh) I really want to go karaoke with my friends [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (um) if it's not karaoke
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak pergi main bola dengan</malay> my <malay>kawan</malay>
[oh] of course I want to <malay>keluar dengan</malay> my family
(uh) <malay>ajak dia orang pergi</malay> dinner (um)
and for my girlfriend (uh) probably go out on a date
you know (uh) <malay>pergi</malay>
somewhere (uh) and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
[oh]
<malay>tak pernah dengar pasal</malay> hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher <malay>tu boleh buat untuk</malay> staycation
(uh) anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
[oh] ya (um) actually
<malay>dah lama</malay> plan
(err) go staycation at least
ease off my mind off (uh) <malay>jauh dari rumah</malay> at least you know
meet somewhere that <malay>macam</malay>
I have never been before so at least
(uh) <malay>boleh</malay> relax my mind
[oh] (uh)
<malay>bila</malay> I go wild wild wet
(um)
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
<malay>kita pergi</malay> wild wild wet but actually it's different because
<malay>kena</malay> lineup time (uh) the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people <malay>dekat dalam</malay> you only can go one round
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
<malay>boleh</malay> enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go #sentosa#
(uh) go beach with my family and
<malay>agaknya</malay>
cannot <malay>agaknya</malay> bring my girlfriend along
and (uh) you know swim
<malay>dekat sana</malay>
(um) actually <malay>tak pernah pergi sana</malay> but I hope to try
(um) I'm not afraid of heights
are you
(um)
like just now <malay>bila</malay>
I <malay>cakap</malay> I don't like (uh) I mean I like heights right
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
I <malay>takut</malay>
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
<malay>bila dia tengah naik</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
(um) I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
<malay>tapi</malay> no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] similar
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube (err) like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
<malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> [lah] because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and <malay>nak cuba</malay>
drifting
and
<malay>agaknya kalau boleh</malay>
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
(uh) I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
<malay>macam</malay>
(err) when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
(um) my favourite car is
(uh)
(uh)
there's <malay>satu</malay> specific
that I <malay>suka</malay>
it's a M three (uh) I <malay>tahu</malay> you don't like cars but
(uh) is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
ya actually <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
my favourite car is mostly (uh) japanese
for example (uh) Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
(um)
<malay>tak tipu</malay> actually is one of my favourite
#tokyo# drift <malay>punya cerita</malay> (uh) in all the movies
#tokyo# drift is one of them
[ah] actually
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>percaya</malay> there's nine fast and furious movie
but I only watch till
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so <malay>macam dah malas nak tengok</malay>
and I watch (uh)
way before [ah]
(uh) nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because (uh) he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
ya <malay>macam</malay> for me
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>boleh suka bola</malay> like
<malay>semenjak kecil</malay> (uh)
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
(err) like twenty years
in fact that
<malay>semua</malay> of my family
support the same club
(uh) yes <malay>ada</malay> baby pictures of me wearing a
man united shirt
(um)
actually I <malay>suka</malay> club too because of the history
and (uh) the manager himself that (uh) brought man untied to win (uh)
twenty titles
man U
<malay>dah tak macam dulu</malay>
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
(uh) they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win (uh) all the (uh) season
and (err) what I heard recently
(uh) but it's <malay>datang</malay> from a rival club [ah]
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
<malay>bagus juga untuk dia orang</malay>
after like how many years <malay>dia orang menang</malay> club (uh) cup
(um) I'm not being a hater <malay>tapi macam</malay> I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
while man U have already won twenty times
if
<malay>kalau tak nak pergi kerja</malay> you can always take <malay>tapi kalau dah ambil</malay>
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [lah] rest <malay>dekat rumah</malay>
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
(uh) probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya (uh) (um)
hards hard time has to come first <malay>baru</malay>
easy life <malay>baru datang</malay> so don't expect everything to be easy
(mm)
ya I get what you mean <malay>tapi</malay>
ya I also
<malay>harap</malay> that everything will
(err)
go back into the normal state [lah]
and <malay>boleh dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>boleh dapat kerja senang</malay>
and everybody starts to work normally and (uh) (uh)
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> everybody at (uh) live their normal life after that

I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that [lah] so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought (um) monday since since (uh) like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay [lah] the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night [lah] night shift like I can work from eleven to
(err) eleven to I think
seven [ah] seven seven eleven near
near my house [lah] near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny [leh] I I didn't
I didn't get a reply [ah] they didn't reply me it's actually
I thought <malay>macam</malay> I thought like I thought
<malay>macam</malay> like seven eleven jobs is easy to get [kan] but
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get [seh] I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job [kan]
[ah] yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're (err) ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so [ah] it's easy for me to
to work somewhere in (uh) plaza <malay>singapura</malay> [lah] plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then I can (err) it's
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier [lah] so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which (uh) which location you prefer
then
!huh!
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
second they called me they say which [ah] which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then
they send my resume to plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then
now I'm waiting for another call [lah] then they so far never call they're taking quite some time [ah] I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true [lah] true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that (err) right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that (um)
some people are not really serious about the job [lah] they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point [lah] so
that's what my mother said [lah] then I I think I think quite
true [lah] like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
(err) I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they [ah] (um)
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
(err) diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary [lah] a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs [lah] so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya [lah] of course [lah] I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like (um) if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time [lah] I will I will do (mm)
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently [lah] I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up [lah] definitely like (um)
ya getting easily more tired or you know like (um)
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different [lah] when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like (um) [oh] I'm the best I can do
[oh] I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
(um) you realize
you're not really the best [ah] other people better than you or then you
you start to ya [lah] it's a different thing [lah]
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also [lah] different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya [lah] different different privileges
yes
correct [lah] actually actually true [lah] I I
[ah] I know I mean the the the thing is that because (err) right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they have a different way of <malay>macam</malay> approaching things [lah] they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk [lah] I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
people have more <malay>macam</malay> people are more more polite [lah] <malay>bila</malay> I talk to people
[ah] nicely have respect for elders but
!huh! I don't know about the the the the current (um) I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all [lah] some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have (um) respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job [lah] teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
<malay>macam</malay> really down to earth they they know
they know how to talk to to
older people [lah] so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them [lah] like (um)
like old old people old values [lah] old values like like (um)
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know

<malay>cepat</malay> [lah] one <malay>masa berlalu</malay> very fast [lah] to me like my <malay>masa</malay>
pass very fast [lah] for me so
so [a'ah] [lah]
<malay>rasa dia macam</malay>
a lot <malay>dah tukar</malay> [lah] I mean a lot of a lot of changes [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> singapore <malay>dulu dengan</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> a lot of changes [lah] <malay>cara</malay>
<malay>cara hidup sekarang sekarang</malay>
<malay>makin laju</malay> everything became became faster
then <malay>macam</malay> everybody rushing then <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>aku</malay> feel last time was more (um)
was more relaxed [lah] more
laid back chill ya
so (um)
COVID I mean
<malay>ke</malay> time lockdown [eh] time lockdown I (uh) lockdown period I think
(mm)
(mm) <malay>takut tak</malay> [lah] I mean
apocalypse no [lah]
ya actually <malay>aku</malay> actually I I thought of that also [lah] I mean I I already
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing [ah] nothing much [lah]
I I was just trying to get along earn money [lah] you know ya
ya
[oh] okay okay okay ya the first the very first (um)
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one [lah] phase one circuit breaker was
was ya [lah] it's a bit a bit (um)
a bit stressful [lah] stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
[oh] circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like [ah] I I don't care [lah] I will still go out [lah] I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that [lah] I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing [lah] then I I
you know I I I decided to <malay>macam</malay> I came to
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing [lah] so it's not like
it's not something you can like <malay>belek</malay> here <malay>belek</malay> there and like go
just go out you know like
(um)
and not get caught or what <malay>macam</malay>
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also [lah]
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [ah] [eh] I remember I remember those times [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
weird [lah] you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly (um)
(hmm)
(mm)
ya (mm) definitely different
different time [lah] you know (err) nobody
nobody expected this to happen [lah] so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed [lah] that time they a lot of people stressed (err) a lot of (uh)
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry [lah] then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct (mm)
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs [eh] actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like #tampines# interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from #tampines# interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like (um)
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
(err) cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
(err) hopeless [lah] you feel quite sad [lah] like like like <malay>macam</malay> like
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot (uh) like harder
times [lah] a lot of people going through like more hardship [lah] you know that
if you think you are like
<malay>macam</malay> going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship [lah] like
quite sometimes I feel quite (um)
I just feel quite sad [lah] sometimes when I see all this [lah] ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced [lah] forced to
forced to stop working and
ya that one ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [lah] there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of <malay>macam</malay> views on that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
will say different things [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
like nature nature telling us something <malay>ke apa</malay> you know that kind of thing so
ya but anyway like (um)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] we just have to make the best of it [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I mean (um) ya definitely <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku baca dekat</malay> news
<malay>aku baca dekat</malay> (uh) yahoo news that <malay>macam</malay> a lot of a lot of deejays <malay>yang main</malay>
a lot of like (uh) house deejays I mean like resident deejays <malay>yang main dekat macam</malay>
<malay>dekat</malay> fullerton <malay>dekat</malay> you know <malay>dekat</malay>
wherever [lah]
ya ya all the deejays <malay>yang</malay> spin
<malay>semua</malay> most of them out of job [lah] <malay>habis</malay>
from earning like <malay>macam</malay> like
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business [ah] catering business they do sell
like food online or online or <malay>macam</malay> food delivery online then
ya then it's not only that [lah] (uh) basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped [lah] then no cannot get money [lah] music business
bars and all that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> whatever that has music [ah]
so the next thing that
actually <malay>macam</malay> counter that thing <malay>yang</malay> is actually can survive and
(err) like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies [lah] video
I mean (um)
[ah] [ah] if you're comparing <malay>macam</malay> like music [eh] audio and video right
right now video is doing
more important [lah] video is doing well [lah] like ya (um)
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a (err) (uh) to make a content right so
(uh) right now video is important [lah] <malay>macam</malay> there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs (err)
are out there [lah] there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
ya [lah] so sometimes I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] I if had taken a video (err) course or what then
would have been different [lah] but but ya [lah] <malay>macam nasib</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul itu</malay> [lah] that's why that's why right now
I mean <malay>ada</malay> <malay>macam</malay> I I got my school
is like lessons from home all zoom zoom lessons from home right so
so actually I feel honestly right now <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>macam</malay> want to give up [lah] because
<malay>macam</malay> there's no more industry there's no no more music industry right then
then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like sometimes
like want to give up [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> like like
like what am I going to do since next time like if if the if this thing continue then
you know of of course there's still <malay>macam</malay> online streaming all that [lah] <malay>cuma</malay>

okay <malay>jap aku okay first aku tengok</malay> doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic [kan] so it's like <malay>macam</malay> (um) is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously <malay>ada</malay> that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then (um) I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think <malay>kirakan</malay> about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay [ah] ya to me [ah] so I watched the doctor romantic first [lah] <malay>yang</malay> first <malay>tu</malay> so it was that that show is about <malay>apa banyak</malay> doctor doctor <malay>punya</malay> scene [ah] so it's like <malay>banyak</malay> so <malay>jadi punya tempat punya</malay> scene !wah! you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like [eh] can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery <malay>punya punya apa nama dia</malay> what do you call it (uh) surgery <malay>punya</malay>
ya the videos and scene
it's it's it's really they they they really take a video of you like cutting the cutting the
it's very cool I tell you [ah] you know when I watching I was like bro this is
grey's [oh] grey's (uh) (uh) anatomy is it is is it like
#weh# maybe I should maybe I should watch that because I really love doctor romantic
so doctor
[ah] I see I see
k

right you know even the cinematography the sound the the music
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama <malay>punya</malay> they are so tip top bro
everything
everything everything in K drama is tip top I really love it
it's jut so even though is like just hoodie and like
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors <malay>pakai</malay> [oh] my god <malay>cantik</malay>
[kan]
just pleasing to the eyes [lah]
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same [tau] like as in like but it's just that why can't it why <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam tak sama</malay> [tau] <malay>aku aku pun macam</malay>
[ah] ya
[oh] true true true true true
[kan] [oh] my god but hotel #del luna# though [oh] shit

I don't watch I don't watch
so <malay>dia macam tak ada tak ada</malay>
[ah] I see

[ah]
I mean maybe not so because <malay>kadang-kadang orang nak</malay> [kan] people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama [eh] <malay>dia banyak</malay> international fans [tau]
<malay>banyak gila</malay> international fans

(uh) no no no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] [oh] my god that [one]
(uh) I think so
[oh]
<malay>itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka</malay> but I think I remember <malay>dulu bila</malay> back then also <malay>selalu tengok</malay> because <malay>selalu bila kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] <malay>mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada</malay> box [kan] you know the android box that kind of thing
the [one] that can like watch all the channels and all the different [one]
ya ya you can watch movie use that also so it's like
<malay>dulu mana ada benda tu semua</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam</malay>
ya so there's always a singapore <malay>nya</malay> channel so <malay>dah tengok</malay> singapore <malay>nya</malay> channel <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like <malay>main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya</malay> button <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita tengok</malay> [ah] like some of it <malay>macam</malay> all the <malay>apa nama dia</malay> channel one is it <malay>yang</malay> all that dub basically that thing [lah]
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember [ah] when I first like came upon on that that <malay>apa</malay> channel [lah] <malay>aku macam apa benda</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
it's it's just not pleasing to the ears ya it's it's like it's not synchronise same to like you look you look but you hear you different
I think ya [oh] my god okay even <malay>aku rasa</malay> even <malay>kalau dorang kalau</malay> #park seo joon# <malay>cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka</malay>
!huh! but imagine he talking malay though
but ya I cannot [lah] watch that kind of show I just need the original <malay>punya</malay>
actually okay
[oh] ya
ya
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but honestly for me also [kan] <malay>kalau tengok</malay> (um) subtitle <malay>dengan</malay> drama at the same time <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you know you wanna
for real
okay I guess I I am I am like that to a certain extent
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm (uh) is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>aku dengar</malay> [jer] [kan]
[kan] <malay>sama sama</malay>
ya
ya exactly
but then but then you know sometimes <malay>kalau macam</malay> I mean not not (um) not korean drama also like like anything [ah] because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like <malay>macam</malay> make faces so is like <malay>macam</malay> if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then <malay>macam</malay> you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I <malay>tak faham</malay>
[oh] no the the translation the translation is like very <malay>macam</malay> so formal right the word
big word
yo same [ah] same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix <malay>aku tengok</malay> malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like !whoa! what are saying translation <malay>ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham</malay> [seh]
[oh]
using that big big words
I think it's because of the translation [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> like <malay>kalau kalau apa</malay> malay drama pun <malay>kadang-kadang dorang guna</malay> all the <malay>peribahasa ke</malay> or like the
which are black colour okay singapore you talk sang her [ah] singapore ya
like <malay>kalau</malay> okay singapore <malay>nya tak sangat</malay> [ah] singapore <malay>nya</malay>

ya [lah] ya [lah] I mean that's why I was like wondering <malay>asal sampai</malay> science centre <malay>sebab</malay> from here but
(um) it's I guess it's (um)
ya ya ya but I wouldn't say it's behind [lah]
ya
ya to the side ya
so it's like ya #taman jurong# so I'm like <malay>dari situ</malay> then <malay>boleh jalan</malay> [pe] that's why I was like science centre <malay>asal</malay> [seh]
for real
(hmm)
(hmm)
(uh) ya
[ah]
gosh I hate myself
!wah!
<malay>aku sedih tengok kau</malay>
because there's two short cuts
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau</malay> confident <malay>sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau</malay> [eh] <malay>kau cakap kau dah sampai</malay>
that's why bro what the hell
[oh] my god
how how dumb ass can you be [sia]
what bull bull ass is that I don't think that's a good reason though
I
ya I mean <malay>kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>kita semua dah berapa tahun</malay> obviously we have to be like independent
ya
ya
[oh] ya
!wah! you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like <malay>macam</malay> okay so <malay>dah nak dekat kiamat</malay> [kan] so like why not I <malay>apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat</malay> #madinah# <malay>ke</malay> #makkah# <malay>ke kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>jumpa dengan dajjal</malay> [kan] so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when (uh) one thing <malay>yang aku tak tahu</malay> is that <malay>dorang cakap</malay> that <malay>apa nama dia</malay> even even <malay>orang yang duduk kat</malay> #makkah# <malay>dengan</malay> #madinah# (um)
no no no you <malay>dajjal</malay> can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the <malay>apa malaikat</malay> [ah] so like <malay>macam</malay> but then the thing is within #makkah# and #madinah# there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami [tau]
in in the end of times [ah] so there will be so (uh) because of that tsunami or earthquake it will <malay>keluarkan orang-orang yang</malay>
<malay>beriman gitu</malay> [ah]
you wear this strong enough to you [ah] can react how which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself [what]
[ah] that means because of the tsunami and earthquake that is inside #madinah# and #makkah#
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in <malay>itu</malay> so <malay>yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri</malay> they will <malay>keluar</malay>
so the
<malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dorang akan</malay> stay inside so that's why <malay>yang</malay> so that's why I was like thinking <malay>abeh kalau macam tu kalau</malay> in the end of times <malay>kalau aku pergi sana juga</malay> then what's the point though <malay>sebab</malay> because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore <malay>kau mana ada</malay> experience tsunami or earthquake <malay>pun</malay> [kan]
ya you know you know that time <malay>aku pernah pergi</malay> japan <malay>dengan sekolah aku pergi sana</malay> for school trip [lah] [kan] so then <malay>lepas itu aku</malay>
[oh] <malay>itu pun</malay>
[ah] australia <malay>dorang apa</malay> #afini# (uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>tak bukan</malay> #atikah# #ella# <malay>dengan</malay> #alia# <malay>dorang pergi</malay> melbourne so <malay>aku pergi</malay> japan <malay>dengan</malay> #puteri# <malay>dengan</malay> #ifa# so <malay>aku pergi sana</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) [kan] you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big <malay>apa gitu</malay> [kan] so
so
ya so <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi</malay> #hiroshima# <malay>dengan aku pergi</malay> #osaka#
ya ya ya ya ya so exact obviously it's a school trip so obviously you have to learn about all the
yes history all that so <malay>dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal</malay> history [kan] so <malay>dah alang-alang belajar</malay> history <malay>kita nak kena belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> we went to this <malay>macam</malay> ambulance place [eh] not ambulance <malay>macam</malay> fire place <malay>gitu</malay> to like learn about <malay>macam</malay> ways to like save yourself from like <malay>apa</malay>
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually [ah] we did a earthquake <malay>punya</malay> simulation
bro <malay>kau tahu sebab dia ada</malay> stages [tau] <malay>bila</malay> that simulation [kan] <malay>aku pergi</malay> we all had to take turns going [ah] I try [ah] because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself [ah] just anything to protect yourself
so <malay>aku pergi sana aku macam</malay> so there's like different different (um)
<malay>apa</malay> ya
ya so it's like (uh) they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us (uh) <malay>yang</malay> medium or towards the high a bit just to <malay>rasa rasa</malay> [kan]
not not even the worst bro because it's because I think that's
it's just the tip of the iceberg [ah] you think just a bit [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
it's not the worst [ah] it's not the level seven [ah] it's like level four or five <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kasi kita</malay> try [kan] <malay>kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar</malay> [siol] it's really it's really like <malay>bergegar</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> I can't even like
are you sure
I see I see I see
<malay>jap</malay> so <malay>kalau kita</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> okay so <malay>kalau kita tengah</malay> earthquake <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kita boleh masuk sini tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> as in like as in like it's not a good place right <malay>sebab benda ni</malay> [kan]
right so like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kat bawa</malay> [jer] [kan] but then <malay>jatuh juga</malay> so like
<malay>tak dorang cakap</malay> [kan] because <malay>kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk</malay> cover [kan]
[ah] <malay>kau kau guna</malay> anything to cover yourself just to like <malay>macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau</malay>
ya ya ya so because <malay>kau punya</malay> head <malay>yang paling</malay> important [pe] <malay>dia yang dia yang</malay> control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why [ah] <malay>macam apa nama dia</malay> (um) they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like <malay>macam</malay> wooden <malay>ke apa ke</malay> as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
[oh] I know
ya [oh] my god that [one] <malay>sedih juga</malay> though <malay>kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi</malay> I mean okay <malay>tapi kau punya kaki dah</malay>
[ah] and like <malay>kalau dah penyek kau</malay> confirm <malay>nak kena</malay> amputate
[kan] but I mean
you know I was like thinking how can I be so lucky to be in this country in this religion in this like family
I'm like
what a what a blessing [sia] so much blessing in one time [tau]
ya
it wasn't a couple years back
but a few years
[ah] I see I see
pandemic
but
but it's not as bad as this [oh] that [one] was it before SARS or no
I think it's before SARS
[ah] <malay>itu itu lama gila</malay>
(mm)
[ah] it wasn't
[oh]
I know it was a big thing in singapore [ah] but it's just for what because we were
ya so that's why a bit scary [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic [lah] but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is <malay>apa kirakan</malay> it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well [lah] like <malay>sekarang</malay>
[eh] is there I'm not sure though is there I mean I don't think so if I'm not wrong they say there isn't any
it looks a like flu [ah] like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
[kan] [kan]
[kan]
<malay>kesian dok</malay>
[kan]
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though
singapore actually <malay>dapat</malay>
[kan]
it's good that <malay>kita kecil</malay> [ah] cause <malay>kalau kita kalau kita besar</malay> confirm <malay>tak boleh</malay> control [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
(hmm) <malay>lagi nasib baik kat</malay> singapore <malay>ada banyak</malay> quite a number of (uh) hospital [kan] and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think <malay>ada</malay> quite a number at least at least two [ah] ya then now cause <malay>sekarang</malay> they are all starting to built community hospital
ya
community hospital basically
if I'm not mistaken community hospital <malay>yang</malay> all the firstly is all the very minor minor <malay>punya</malay> sickness [ah] are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing [lah]
yes not for surgery kind of thing
ya it's also
ya ya
and it's also for people <malay>yang</malay> from the major hospital transfer to
yes yes yes
ya that's why
I mean #ng teng fong# <malay>ada</malay> community hospital
ya
that's why
ya
<malay>tak apa pun</malay>
ya so that's why so <malay>sekarang dorang dah buat</malay> community hospital <malay>kat sini</malay> so I guess if I'm not that time <malay>aku pergi</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> [eh] woodlands <malay>ke</malay> east side east side or north side <malay>aku pergi aku pun nampak</malay> they are like trying to built something then it looks like <malay>macam</malay> community hospital also <malay>dari luar</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok</malay> renovation [kan] then <malay>nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu</malay> [kan]
so like you can see like all the you know like <malay>kalau</malay> for houses I don't know if you know [ah] but for houses [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then <malay>kalau</malay> for hospital they would show hospital <malay>punya itu</malay> ya so <malay>macam</malay> from the outside we can
I kind of saw like <malay>macam</malay> that that thing [lah] so I was like [oh] I guess because <malay>kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah</malay>
I mean is <malay>sekarang banyak gila</malay> foreigner <malay>datang sini</malay> [seh] like <malay>banyak gila</malay>
ya but in the first place there is so many
ya
expats expats
I didn't know expats were okay sorry expats ya
actually <malay>sekarang</malay>
wait so <malay>bapa kau masih kat sana</malay>
!alah! <malay>sedihnya sorang-sorang</malay>
ya
true true true
[oh]
oil <malay>abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa</malay>
[oh] #jurong# island
[ah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> oil but he's not really in contact with oil [lah] right he's just like
I mean <malay>baju dia kau dah cuci</malay> actually that time [kan] <malay>bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja</malay> airline [kan] so <malay>dia pun nak kena</malay> fix fix all the aeroplane <malay>punya</malay> stuff right
ya then that's why that time [ah] I don't know don't know whether it's a
[ah] ya it's time <malay>kerja</malay> cause <malay>dia cakap dia balik rumah</malay> then <malay>dia nak kena tukar baju</malay> because <malay>apa dia terjatuh</malay> oil ya then I was like I was like shit <malay>apa bau</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
it so strong <malay>macam</malay> toxic
ya but then actually <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> I don't for you but for me <malay>aku kalau pergi</malay> what is it called petrol station <malay>aku suka bau dia</malay>
low-key <malay>tapi aku macam</malay>
should be [lah] right
ya
ya so but then that time <malay>apa dia kena kat dia punya baju</malay> [kan] so <malay>baju</malay> obviously <malay>aku rasa dah</malay> in contact with the skin <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
it's not good [ah]
should be [lah] I don't know
oil right why is oil good
ya so it's like <malay>dia dah mandi</malay> [kan] then <malay>dia dia dia tanya aku</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi</malay> [eh]
that's the thing
ya
