alright
ya so the correct so the third year <malay>aku</malay> move out (err) then I was (uh) staying <malay>dekat</malay> my aunty's <malay>punya</malay> place [lah] so what happens is (uh) I was there (uh) for actually <malay>aku duduk kat rumah dia</malay> [kan] for very long it's about
(uh) overstay my welcome is because I think it's too too long [lah] it should be
(uh) I they gave me hints [lah] ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> place for one and a half years ya one and a half years (err) my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way (err) they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then (uh) that was the the time where <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) you know just tried to just tried to to survive [lah] you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof [lah] and then I was you know so that was a good thing [lah]
correct so that was that was (err) (err) you know (err) at the end of the three years then (err) <malay>aku</malay> early this this this year [ah] first of january actually
(err) sometimes okay terms sometimes <malay>tak</malay> okay [lah] so that means <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> she will invite me back [tau] <malay>macam</malay> (um) you know to to her to the family home [lah] but (uh) sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing [lah] you yes (err) so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back
(um) she totally changed <malay>bukan</malay> change <malay>macam apa</malay> [ah] so she totally <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you know she she's more (err) she she literally like (uh) tries to bother about what I'm doing you know (uh) getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> she I don't know whether she realise [lah] that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing [lah] so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me [lah] now (err) but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months [eh] we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept

I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time [ah] whenever it I'm the same as you [ah] <malay>mesti kalau macam cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak menang</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> in an argument [eh] <malay>kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang</malay> so I'm always <malay>macam</malay> energetically fight back [tau] [ah] passionate <malay>macam</malay> fight back [tau] but nowadays [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through (uh) certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so (uh) <malay>kita macam tak tak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's no more energy to to [ah] to to expand to to argue [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at the most <malay>pun kalau</malay> even if we don't agree [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer [lah] you know it's just you know you just you just stop [lah] just you just don't don't don't speak [lah] but but it's something that I have always (um) like <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really thankful that (um) she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because (err) I I knew back then [eh] I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay [lah] you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because (err) <malay>dia pergi haji</malay> (uh) last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that (uh) she came back and (err) I think I don't know [lah] maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
and then after when she came back ya when she came back (err) she was more (err) you know (err) she was more more able to control herself [lah] her emotions [lah] and on my part also I try to I try to control my own emotions [lah]
ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct

so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this <malay>dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap</malay> I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience [lah] ya and then <malay>apa</malay>

yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya

yup yup yup
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang yang yang ni apa</malay> we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was (uh) the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time [kan] so you ask me to apply for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) opening [kan] <malay>yang yang</malay> ala air steward
ya (err) I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about (uh) I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like [eh] come [lah] just just follow me [lah] you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at <malay>dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>kat</malay> #yishun#
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area <malay>dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>dekat</malay> McDonald's and then <malay>kat luar</malay> and then we were talking about things like illuminati [lah] we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right (um) the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective [tau] which which means okay <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example [eh] I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand [tau] <malay>kenapa dia macam gitu</malay>
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there I I would I would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so (err) and and and it was honestly right my mind [ah] is always a one track thing so let's say for example [kan] <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay I told myself [ah] I I want to become a pilot but (err) I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing [lah] so I I don't have that kind of (err) presence of mind [ah] to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
for me
[oh] right
so so my my life in in this industry [lah] in this aviation industry started out with (um) with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room (uh) on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion [lah] because he wanted to become a pilot himself <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> eyesight (err) <malay>macam tak</malay> (err) how to say [eh] (uh) not hundred percent [lah] not not not not a six six [lah] vision [lah] so (uh) and at that time [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> very strict [kan] <malay>kalau kau punya</malay> eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance <malay>dia lain</malay> [ah] [ah] [tau] yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right <malay>sebab tu</malay> [eh] they realise [eh] in (err) in (err) eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot [tau] who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because <malay>dah tak boleh apa</malay> because you <malay>dah pakai</malay> you <malay>dah pakai</malay> glasses then that's that's it [lah] you you no more already [lah] no more chance right so [ah] so that was what spurt on my motivation (uh) and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in (uh) so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to (err) (err) start the flying course [ah] so that time (uh) they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents (uh) fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight <malay>macam</malay> familiarisation flight [ah] so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> then after that <malay>apa tu</malay> they they brief us and then (err) they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that [lah] this was a very long time ago <malay>sekarang dah takde lagi</malay> [tau]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition (uh) even further because I felt you know [ah] bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight <malay>dekat</malay> youth flying club [tau] and this was when I was sixteen [lah] when I was up there it was such a different feeling
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet [lah] bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing [lah] that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that [lah] ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could <malay>tapi aku</malay> I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics <malay>macam</malay> science [ah] science <malay>punya</malay> subject [kan] (err) I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
(uh) it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time [ah] I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my (uh) my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so (uh) puzzled because <malay>did cakap apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) [eh] I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics [ah] but your other topics [ah] you <malay>rabak</malay> man you cannot make it why [ah] then I realise that but it was it was (uh) (uh) only way way way later [lah] then I realise that (uh) okay I I I actually
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) I mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which I could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was (uh) just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so I had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally <malay>aku tak boleh bergerak</malay> I was just I I and I still remember that day was my (uh) examination my english paper <malay>punya</malay> examination and (err) I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now [ah] okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
it recurred again ya it recurred again so (uh) that was another dent in my in my in my dreams [lah] basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know <malay>aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay> air steward <malay>punya</malay> interview <malay>tu yang aku</malay> pass
(err) actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why <malay>aku tak aku tak dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>jadi</malay> (err) air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up [lah] how it all times ties back together
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was (uh) in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation <malay>aku pakai ni aku pakai</malay> my medisave (uh) my my <malay>apa tu orang panggil</malay>
(uh) I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid (uh) <malay>pakai</malay> insurance [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my medical insurance [ah] ya (err) for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
<malay>apa</malay> working
am I still what
in that in that in in in that [ah] [oh] debt (uh) I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
<malay>ada ada sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>ada ada sikit</malay> (uh) my mortgage [kan] every month is (uh) one point one K (uh) <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) they cut off <malay>aku punya</malay> (uh) eight hundred
so <malay>aku kena</malay> top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future [lah] <malay>aku aku aku</malay> I was thinking [lah] anyway that [one] is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me [lah] which is why I wanted a bigger place (uh) the other reason was because <malay>aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang</malay> [ah] all my baggage my
[eh] I don't mind man I really don't mind <malay>kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat</malay> it's just beside admiralty [jer] also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area [kan] and (uh) the it's only about <malay>macam</malay> five minutes
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay> it's not it's (uh) it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential <malay>punya punya</malay> place [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate (uh) site I was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when I was in the
yes I was there (uh) okay [lah] it was it was (uh) it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is (um) when you are overseas [eh] (err) your how do I put it [eh] you you're considered as an expat [tau] so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration [lah] so that's the reason why (um) most of us [kan] <malay>kita belajar kat sana</malay> we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to (uh) apply with the local <malay>punya</malay> okay so right now right now (err) so okay so so right now what happens is this [eh]
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
so (uh) average [lah] it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level [lah] I'm not I'm not a <malay>macam</malay> senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of (uh) about four K about there [lah] about about (uh) thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes so when COVID happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) I mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so I thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did [lah] and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed <malay>kita dah</malay> sign contract <malay>kita dah</malay> sign #dok# we even we even (err) graduated <malay>kita semua dah</malay> celebrate [seh] we went out drinking I mean
[ah] <malay>tak tak tak tak tak</malay> I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks [lah] along the way there's you know there's <malay>ujian</malay> there's setbacks there's (uh)
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
ya I know right <malay>macam nasib kentang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before [lah] this phrase I know I know
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining [lah] you know in in every ya so <malay>aku</malay> I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to (uh) goes back on track and all that right (uh) I I'm pretty sure [lah] one day [lah] one day I (uh) you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it [lah]
but but for now (uh) I got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
[eh] it's a different skill set [lah] [sia] it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself (uh) being on the drone so when I see it I was like [oh] okay ya [lah] but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do (uh) (uh) that's relatable and that's (uh) you know but I think (uh) they they have already announced <malay>macam</malay> plans [lah] you know
(uh) they want to push us to become (uh) flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is (uh) back to normal again right (uh) I think you know hopefully [lah] hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] #dok# flight <malay>tak boleh</malay>
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen [ah] but if that ever happens [ah] you will know why [ah] you know all about the history behind it [lah] you can tell people [oh] yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya [lah] yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know [oh] my goodness
yes
yes yes yes
effort yes yes
(mm) (mm) ya ya ya ya ya I
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm) okay

school is fine but it is very boring (um) because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
so <malay>macam</malay> very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
Y-
like from other courses [kan]
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
if <malay>aku ada pagi punya kelas</malay> then she have <malay>petang punya kelas</malay> then if have if I have <malay>petang punya kelas</malay> then she have <malay>pagi punya kelas</malay> then it's like you really boring
<malay>lepas tu</malay> it's like how to say
it's very dry cause <malay>sekarang tak ada</malay> hands on cause of the COVID so <malay>kita tak ada jadi</malay> hands on activity
then I'm like central <malay>ada macam</malay>
(uh) childcare <malay>kat dalam</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi kita tak dapat pergi</malay> and we suppose to <malay>pergi</malay> so now it's like really dry and like (err) boring and all we do is like <malay>datang</malay> school [lah] <malay>habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita</malay> just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
but then at the same time <malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>dapat jumpa kawan</malay> [pe]
<malay>aku suka kawan</malay>
<malay>dapat jumpa kawan habis</malay> like
we go eat together sometimes <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes cause <malay>semua tinggal jauh-jauh</malay> so we cannot
go eat together
then when your school start
true
(mm) ya
(mm)
(mm)
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
(uh) in the because we have like college west
east right
and then (err) west and east they don't
do anymore but then college central still do but now because [ah] recently <malay>ada</malay> like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless <malay>macam</malay> is online class <malay>tu pun</malay> online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
<malay>habis lepas tu kita buat</malay> powerpoint slides about the muscles all [lah]
but [ah] then actually <malay>tak</malay> do like any like that is <malay>kalau kita buat macam</malay> project <malay>ni</malay> [kan]
it is counted as <malay>kita punya</malay> participation mark
like because in like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot [lah] from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now <malay>kita tak boleh buat</malay> so we don't do anymore then we have like
(um)
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like (uh)
tests we take tests we take (uh) we do assignments we do (uh)
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade [lah] like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then <malay>macam</malay> quite <malay>senang</malay> [lah] cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you [oh] your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing [kan] <malay>pasal</malay>
each of the people can there's like (uh) over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final <malay>nanti kau</malay> your
<malay>kau dapat</malay> when <malay>nanti kau dapat tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> do like well <malay>ke tak</malay> then after that for my class like [kan] you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good [kan] you have the opportunity to retake your <malay>punya</malay> like test [lah] but then my class <malay>tak ada orang</malay> retake <malay>cikgu cakap</malay> like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we <malay>dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan</malay> but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module <malay>tu macam</malay> cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do [kan] so you learn a lot more to <malay>macam</malay> business more like
(um)
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
(uh) like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) in <malay>macam</malay> experience through experience cause we do a lot <malay>buat macam</malay> relationship management <malay>lepas tu kita buat</malay> the time <malay>kita buat</malay> like <malay>kita punya</malay> individual presentation [kan] it just
[ah] I talk about like first
[ah] seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life [lah]
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood [ah] that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
(um)
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online [jer] [lah] but then it's very complicated because like
we in right this is the frustrating thing [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay> just go just go through
<malay>cikgu</malay> just go through <malay>mana</malay> part <malay>yang kita nak ada buat</malay> assignment [one] <malay>dia orang tak ajar</malay> like throughout <malay>macam</malay> in secondary school they <malay>ajar</malay> everything [what] even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and <malay>dia orang bagi pun</malay>
(uh) is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like <malay>kenapa budak ini nangis</malay> then <malay>kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak</malay> [eh] separate <malay>dengan</malay> parents [jer] then (uh) what kind of symptoms
(uh) what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
(uh) mental (uh) mental disabilities is
a lot to that
so <malay>macam</malay> a bit dry it's very dry
and then
business writing is more to <malay>macam</malay> you write emails letters
(um) minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then [ah] like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
then is easier in a way because <malay>ada</malay> multiple choice
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then <malay>yang</malay> section <malay>yang lain</malay> cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like (err) after finishing exam right
we are like like you said [lah] this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april [oh] we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like <malay>macam</malay> how to say
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go <malay>tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab</malay> COVID
<malay>tak yang mana</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh keluar sedih</malay> and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh keluar</malay> cause <malay>mana-mana pergi tak ada duit</malay>
so <malay>mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit</malay> [kan]
so it's just but I just want to sleep
and then like <malay>ni</malay> then can think about like other stuff
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like [oh] my god we just stay in the first semester why [ah] why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
but they want to <malay>tanya</malay> you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
(mm)
(mm)
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
do like I I I just like to get it over with <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau
<malay>kalau kau buat seorang</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> like I can do <malay>bila-bila aku nak</malay> I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
<malay>macam</malay> I'm a I'm a bad person [lah] I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
(uh)
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like <malay>banyak gila</malay> is the amount of like group projects right is <malay>banyak</malay> is like until like every week you <malay>tukar</malay> group you've just <malay>tukar tukar tukar</malay> constantly you <malay>tukar</malay> cause <malay>cikgu</malay> first of all like
(mm)
the reason they give is because <malay>sebab apa cikgu nak kita</malay> meet
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
(uh)
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
(uh)
how you
work with people they want <malay>dia orang nak tengok</malay> how
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
speak english or like other <malay>ada apa</malay> language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
how you
<malay>macam mana kau boleh</malay> cope <malay>dengan</malay> working with other people
but then I find it very like
even
<malay>kalau aku</malay> group <malay>yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat</malay> frustrated [tau]
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy <malay>aku macam</malay> noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done <malay>macam</malay> complete [ah] <malay>cepat habis cepat kau pergi</malay> relax <malay>cepat kau pergi</malay> like
one corner <malay>kau</malay> there <malay>duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi</malay> time <malay>kat kelas untuk buat</malay> project <malay>kau</malay> just <malay>duduk</malay> [jer] <malay>apa habis tidur</malay>
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like <malay>semua</malay> my project [kan] is die like <malay>hujung hujung</malay> last minute submit like [eh] but [eh] is good work [lah] we are able to provide good work but it's still
like
it's better if you can finish earlier [kan] in a sense but then
depends <malay>banyak dengan</malay> who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>yang</malay> they are (mm)
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name #ima# cause he just talk malay cause he <malay>macam</malay> he's really a perfect
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand [lah]
because he is the type of person that think very like
[oh] he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
honestly <malay>banyak orang cakap</malay> is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
<malay>banyak yang senang</malay> like
<malay>senang</malay> for you to <malay>masuk senang</malay> for you to complete <malay>senang</malay> for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate <malay>macam kau yang</malay> classmate #bo# #chup# like serious like
<malay>tak buat kerja</malay> [kan] I mean <malay>kau</malay> do <malay>kerja yang</malay> you are given <malay>kau boleh dapat</malay> A even though gonna work is like so bad
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood <malay>pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar</malay> math <malay>kau ajar</malay> one two three four five under ten <malay>pun sudah</malay> okay [dah] you are set for life in that career in that sense [lah]
then after that
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so <malay>macam</malay>
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more [lah] a lot of like opportunities for students
but then <malay>macam</malay> what they never think is that
our class is my class it's very competitive like
really competitive you know like the other type that <malay>macam</malay> every lesson <malay>ada soalan</malay> every lesson <malay>ada soalan</malay> every lesson <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [oh]
they like the <malay>macam</malay>
they really think about their ranking a lot [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I know that some <malay>macam</malay>
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking [lah] but she's clever but #rela# also clever but she also don't think about ranking <malay>macam kita</malay>
sorry to say but <malay>melayu</malay> more relax [lah]
<malay>kita macam</malay> more like okay <malay>tak apa kalau</malay> pass pass <malay>kalau</malay> fail fail <malay>gitu tapi</malay> we try hard
<malay>tapi macam</malay> there are a lot more other races <malay>macam</malay> they are very keen on
<malay>macam</malay> competing <malay>macam</malay> hardcore <malay>gila ni semua</malay> [kan] so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning [ah] but we are learning it break we break up
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
more slower in a sense <malay>kita boleh</malay> more slow but
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like (uh)
like secondary school
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school <malay>macam aku dah</malay> fail fail fail fail fail <malay>lepas tu bila kat</malay> the end <malay>aku macam</malay> okay pass <malay>macam</malay> I made it <malay>jelita</malay> [bah] cause I I do set expectation that are high
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up <malay>macam</malay>
I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
<malay>senang</malay> [jer] <malay>macam gitu</malay> then I'm just like [oh] my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
<malay>aku</malay> go into thinking that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> like <malay>ni</malay> like it will be <malay>nak</malay> very easy
it will be like very like easy right
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid <malay>takkan</malay> tell me <malay>budak tapi tak nak</malay> observe <malay>budak tu lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak tanya</malay> write report <malay>pasal budak tu</malay> then I'm just like [oh] my god I cannot do this
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
(uh)
but <malay>dia orang ingat</malay> like <malay>macam ni senang</malay> cause <malay>kau jaga budak</malay> [jer] [pe] <malay>kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga</malay> but actually
we watch how the <malay>budak</malay> grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes <malay>cikgu yang</malay> responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then <malay>kita</malay> okay just <malay>besar macam</malay> okay [lah] by this age <malay>dah cakap</malay> actually there's a
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like [oh] okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
[oh] my god
[oh] I look back my slides right I'm learning [ah] I'm like <malay>tengah</malay> revise [jer] <malay>aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak</malay> and we revise okay that's actually link <malay>kita belajar pasal</malay> brain then <malay>kita faham</malay> okay which <malay>budak pakai</malay> which part of the brain when they are doing this <malay>budak pakai</malay> then we are just like [oh] my god we are just learning like
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
seniors <malay>mereka cakap</malay> from the first year
<malay>kau boleh tahu</malay> how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously <malay>kau dah tahu</malay> like you are like
damn
this is gonna be hard and then [ah] I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
<malay>macam</malay> it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly [eh] <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> they don't know anything about <malay>budak-budak</malay> you don't know anything like
some people even like <malay>masuk</malay> early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how <malay>macam</malay> early childhood has
not a lot of paths for you to go
so end up you <malay>jadi cikgu atau jadi</malay> principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so <malay>macam</malay> that stability is what people want in life [kan]
<malay>dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni</malay> but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
you know that
for the next few years <malay>kau ada</malay> job <malay>untuk dapatkan</malay> they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
(uh) for a few years and like
I want to I don't know initially <malay>memang aku nak baca</malay> psychology
cause that's what I want to learn [what] since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity [kan] I just want to go for like child psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide <malay>macam belum</malay> decide <malay>kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam</malay> I'll pass <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking [lah] we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
poly obviously I <malay>aku tak nak</malay> just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
<malay>apa tu</malay>
my friend said that in every like I was <malay>macam</malay> very when <malay>dapat pergi</malay> [kan] you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that <malay>apa tu</malay> once in your lifetime you must experience life
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like [ah] you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID so <malay>kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi</malay> we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she <malay>bawa</malay> nintendo switch [jer] <malay>pergi</malay> class [ah] <malay>semua orang main</malay> just dance is like that kind of thing
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
all of us want to go poly <malay>semua nak pergi</malay> poly <malay>kita punya</malay> ultimate goal is poly
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter [kan]
<malay>macam bila kau kat</malay> first day
<malay>dia orang tanya kau</malay> like (um)
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay #ngee ann# #temasek# #ngee ann# #temasek# that kind of stuff [bah] <malay>banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi</malay> twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
<malay>macam susah tapi</malay> that
<malay>bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap</malay> okay <malay>memangnya</malay> it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that's obviously true [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>susah</malay> then I see you learn by <malay>laju</malay> so <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
[oh] my god I cannot take this <malay>aku macam dah</malay> stress I remember [ah] me thinking that when I do my assignment like [oh] my god is already so stress <malay>aku dah</malay> stress <malay>gila masa buat</malay> assignment <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> like sometimes <malay>kalau kau</malay> message <malay>aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot do this <malay>aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak</malay> focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>itu yang susah</malay> transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in <malay>kat</malay> [ah] secondary school all these are the teacher <malay>untuk</malay> guide <malay>kau</malay> like okay <malay>kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni</malay> okay <malay>kau nak</malay> submit [kan] <malay>ni kau nak</malay> submit [kan] <malay>tu</malay> in <malay>kalau kau tak nak</malay> submit <malay>cikgu macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kenapa kau tak buat</malay> submit
[ah] <malay>kau nak</malay> submit [tau] next time <malay>tapi dia dia orang tak</malay> remind <malay>kau</malay> they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay <malay>ada</malay> exam make sure <malay>belajar tu</malay> [jer] <malay>aku macam</malay> what the hell <malay>aku macam</malay> come on man like
that is the shock and then I think
adaptation is how you are [ah] adapt let me [ah] I think most people <malay>tak nak</malay> it's understandable <malay>kalau kau tak nak</malay>
go to poly after
cause <malay>kalau kau dah</malay> badly adapt poly right <malay>kenapa tu</malay> like you <malay>kau tak macam</malay> you cannot get used to
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
<malay>macam</malay> I know [ah] focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like <malay>macam cikgu ajar</malay> one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
<malay>macam</malay>
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language <malay>macam</malay> mother tongue
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important <malay>macam</malay> but then now they are making like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] mother tongue <malay>punya</malay> base preschool <malay>semua</malay> [kan] but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words <malay>macam</malay> there are some things about [ah] what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's <malay>macam kat</malay> movie
like <malay>macam</malay> devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
<malay>punya</malay> like thinking how they make decisions <malay>macam mana</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>budak ni</malay>
like ego is what
like is like <malay>macam</malay> evil not evil [lah]
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] when we realised that it's hard <malay>macam susah</malay>
serious <malay>susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung</malay> just <malay>tidur</malay> I cannot take it <malay>aku macam kelas pukul lapan</malay> we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
<malay>kita</malay> back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you <malay>macam</malay> I think the
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
<malay>macam kau punya</malay> record <malay>senang kau</malay> record like how to say that time <malay>aku</malay> the whole way <malay>aku tidur</malay> like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I (uh) sleeping
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so <malay>aku tengok balik</malay> recording okay <malay>macam</malay> okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff <malay>macam</malay> keeping <malay>balik</malay> cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like <malay>kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap</malay> okay fine
it's a good day but then it's like
it's just seriously hard [oh] you know <malay>macam</malay> now is
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least [eh] there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like (ugh)
older and more responsibility in a sense
now like <malay>macam</malay> honestly okay at eighteen right [ah] when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
and then [ah] one of
I have a older friend right #aqilah# [kan] a year older then <malay>dia</malay> she tell me <malay>macam tegur aku</malay> [lah]
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
what kind of people you want to mix around with <malay>kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan</malay>
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
cause <malay>biasalah</malay> cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
<malay>macam</malay>
and eighteen [kan] <malay>kau</malay> obviously <malay>kawan kau bukan semua ada</malay> boyfriends [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [jer] [kan] [oh] <malay>ajak kawan ada</malay> they're going out <malay>dia orang keluar kat</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia orang lepas tu dia orang</malay> go to the beach even <malay>kat</malay> COVID COVID <malay>ni dia orang</malay> text <malay>sahaja</malay> it's just like (ugh) I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau nak</malay> boyfriend <malay>tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa</malay> are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay [lah] <malay>kau tak ada</malay> boyfriend
that's why I relax <malay>macam</malay> okay now I realise you know <malay>macam</malay> ninety percent of my friends that you <malay>macam</malay>
my close friend [lah] <malay>macam kau aqilah</malay> megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
I would choose studies [lah] if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you (uh) I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe #hada# you know she has <malay>macam ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan]
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated [ah] she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
takes a lot of decision [tau] cause <malay>kau</malay> one year <malay>kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak</malay> moving along with your life [what] <malay>dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah</malay> getting (uh) upgrading yourself in a way [lah] then <malay>kau nak</malay> you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
<malay>betul tak</malay> unless you have boyfriend [lah] but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
it's different <malay>ke</malay> so it's college [lah] so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan <malay>aqil kita</malay> plan <malay>lagi</malay>
<malay>ke</malay> korea <malay>belajar</malay>
[kan]
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and #aqil# are going there for
(err) early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but #hada# don't want to go
then we're just like come on #hada# then she just said <malay>kita tak nak</malay>
<malay>apa tu kita tak nak</malay>
she she doesn't <malay>kita tak nak</malay> how to say <malay>dia nak</malay> take a break <malay>dia tak nak</malay> continue <malay>belajar</malay> cause I don't think she prioritise
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
(mm)
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys <malay>kita macam</malay> okay <malay>kita macam</malay> single <malay>sedih</malay> [kan] cause <malay>sedih tak ada</malay> boyfriend
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>sedih dan lain-lain</malay> but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy [kan] is <malay>bila dia bilang aku</malay> [jer] [tau] <malay>dia tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> into the future
I don't like <malay>aku macam</malay> god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like <malay>dia nak kena</malay> get <malay>dia</malay> life straight I like I find guys like <malay>macam tahu</malay> what they are doing in life right very attractive first
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
(mmhmm) it's like
<malay>susah kalau nak</malay> like okay (mm) we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we <malay>macam</malay> get it [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> we
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
who you are in life you know <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay> school decision (um) <malay>aku selalu cakap</malay> [tau] [oh] <malay>tapi</malay> some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are [oh] I'm like
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really <malay>macam</malay> put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
and then but the but then <malay>macam</malay> to me [kan] the
the <malay>aku punya</malay> pressure towards myself is <malay>lebih besar</malay>
so at the end of day [kan] I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because <malay>macam kau</malay> already
like like
<malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>aku ada</malay> a lot of thing spent <malay>untuk diri aku aku ada</malay> like a lot of
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like (ugh) and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
I actually single best <malay>gila sebab kau</malay> first of all <malay>aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak</malay>
like <malay>aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang</malay>
<malay>kau tidur kau lambat aku balik ke rumah kau lambat pagi</malay>
<malay>tak ada orang nak bisingkan aku</malay>
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
<malay>aku</malay>
how to say <malay>aku tak sangat</malay>
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
<malay>aku tak nak lelaki yang macam</malay> sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like <malay>macam macam</malay> I have seen a lot of my friends <malay>banyak bagi tahu aku apa</malay> everyday <malay>kau</malay> everyday <malay>jumpa</malay>
<malay>macam kau</malay> okay <malay>kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam</malay> I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like [ah] you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like (ugh) like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say [ah]
<malay>bila kau dah seorang</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau ada banyak</malay> freedom you know <malay>kau</malay> you can do a lot of things because now <malay>banyak</malay> of my friends that break up they are like [oh] my god
single is fun but after two months they're like [oh] my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then <malay>aku macam aku tak nak</malay> [kan] <malay>saya lelaki aku macam</malay> [ah] you know <malay>macam</malay> my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if <malay>kalau aku dalam</malay> relationship [kan] I would take it very slow
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
cause obviously <malay>aku nak</malay> date for long term
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time [lah] but then like then you realise at the end already right
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>apa yang kau nak</malay> in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like <malay>aku tak ada</malay> boyfriend [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
how I am
most of last most of my last time my friends <malay>ada</malay> contact [kan] can go back with <malay>aku akan</malay> text <malay>macam balik punya</malay> [eh] ya <malay>aku balik macam</malay> but then when [ah] I go back home alone
I feel fine <malay>apa</malay> I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro <malay>tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku</malay> [jer] <malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok</malay> tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff <malay>kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan</malay>
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay <malay>kau nak</malay> you <malay>nak makan tak</malay> the I the best thing is <malay>aku tak payah minta</malay> not <malay>minta macam aku tak payah macam</malay>
like worried <malay>keluar dengan kawan lelaki</malay> boyfriend <malay>aku macam marah</malay> [eh] <malay>kenapa keluar dengan lelaki</malay> like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense <malay>bila kau dah</malay> free for too long
you have a lot of happiness in you
<malay>tunggu macam</malay> how to say [ah]
because my friends say you number one when you break up [eh]
first of all you learn to love yourself back <malay>kenapa macam</malay> cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes <malay>bila dia orang</malay> break up [eh] <malay>dia orang kena</malay> dump they think that <malay>macam</malay> somehow [ah] what's wrong with me <malay>berapa muka soalan kau</malay> [kan] #tang# is like <malay>kenapa aku</malay> then you have to over that
like time where you like okay <malay>aku ni</malay> okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
like that's not good
it's but [ah] then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
<malay>kau</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> build up on yourself [lah]
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID [kan]
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even #raziq# sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] in a way and then
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january #imelda# is different from
september #imelda# now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
cause <malay>fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri</malay>
you know that kind of thing
then <malay>bila</malay> now I'm thinking like at the end of the day <malay>kau seorang</malay> [jer] during this pandemic I spend a lot of time [jer] I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is #raziq#
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
like <malay>bila aku dengar</malay> anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> text all the time then <malay>sekarang macam</malay> I like brother and my sister they were sick [ah] what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam</malay> call boyfriend calling <malay>ni kau tu</malay>
family is important to me <malay>macam</malay> I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together [kan] <malay>kita macam</malay> really emphasise my dad my dad really like
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually [ah] I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
how happy I was when I was with them thing <malay>macam</malay>
my family is a type <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau nak faham</malay> like <malay>kawan</malay> friendship <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> is not
anytime <malay>boleh</malay> end
<malay>walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau boleh</malay> end [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> family <malay>kau</malay> will always be there with you and you need to understand because <malay>kau dah besar</malay> you are adult
adult you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku sekarang</malay> I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] she she like how to say
checks up on our like
(uh) she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
(uh)
location [ah] phone <malay>kita</malay> like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like <malay>kenapa kau nak</malay> lock phone <malay>aku macam</malay> that kind of vibe you know then <malay>bila kita</malay> the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just <malay>macam</malay> how to say
my mum just like [ah] give me touch you <malay>punya</malay> phone
then <malay>kita kena bagi</malay> like my siblings just like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> like they never ask
<malay>aku aku</malay> reply <malay>aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku</malay> phone I <malay>aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak</malay> hide
I have nothing to hide so <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>bagi</malay>
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
<malay>kenapa main kenapa</malay> cause he's always playing game
so <malay>dia macam</malay> very agitated [tau] so <malay>macam</malay>
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
and then <malay>macam kita dapat balik kita macam</malay> okay and <malay>lepas tu</malay> she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what <malay>tu bukan masa aku muda-muda</malay> [tau] <malay>tu</malay> last year [tau] #sasha# knew about this like <malay>apa tu</malay>
and then after that she always like lock <malay>kita punya</malay> phone <malay>semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>habis tu</malay> when family time she lock off [kan] I was like but we don't ever feel <malay>macam</malay>
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
cause like and <malay>macam kalau</malay> you
that app [kan] <malay>kalau kau pakai</malay> more than eight hours [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> lock <malay>kau punya</malay> phone <malay>tu kau tak boleh buka</malay> so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause <malay>aku sahaja</malay> I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend <malay>tak tau</malay> it charge charge <malay>semua pasal kita</malay> just <malay>macam</malay> bond <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> bond
in a sense [lah]
so <malay>macam aku</malay> I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it <malay>kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila</malay> app <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan] then we understand now <malay>kenapa</malay>
cause
naturally now [kan] <malay>kita</malay> spend a lot of time together a lot <malay>kita tak</malay> on the phone <malay>kita macam</malay> I say to my mum
[ah]
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night <malay>kita</malay> watch the harry potter series as a family <malay>macam</malay>
we just like (uh)
(uh) like at eight after my that eight [eh] like all on my <malay>apa dia</malay> off day <malay>kita</malay> just <malay>duduk habis kita tengok</malay> harry potter like <malay>kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam</malay> it's that kind of vibe you know then <malay>macam</malay> but when I spend a lot of time with cousins [kan] I realise that their families are different
<malay>macam</malay> they don't really <malay>tak kisah sangat pasal</malay> family <malay>dia orang</malay> say
okay <malay>aku dah besar</malay> [pe] okay like now what eighteen
<malay>kenapa nak</malay> spend a lot of time with family
cause
<malay>shazlin dia</malay> family <malay>tak pakai baju raya dia</malay> matching [tau]
<malay>dia beli baju raya sendiri duit dia dia beli</malay>
<malay>dia beli sendiri</malay> so <malay>pakai</malay> different colour [ah] but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink [eh]
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay <malay>satu</malay> colour [jer]
then we buy like same colour and it same with <malay>macam makan</malay> [tau] like it's like <malay>puasa</malay> right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night [ah] last day usually last week [kan] <malay>kita banyak makan</malay> take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then <malay>bila aku macam</malay> spend a lot time <malay>macam</malay>
with other people and <malay>aku</malay> realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
but [ah] same to me [ah]
(mm) cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
they <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak macam</malay> forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always <malay>cakap</malay> why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down
a lot so <malay>macam</malay> my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like <malay>macam</malay> every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this

but that day I was at the window seat and then (um)
the sky was so clear it was so beautiful I remember crying

it was super beautiful
ya but some people said (um)
they are away from the problems below
where they are high up you get what I mean
<malay>kau boleh jadi</malay> emirates <malay>punya</malay> [ah] emirates is it emirates
but but my cousin is a
emirates stewardess
<malay>lawa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia</malay>

my job is to just collect money
I'm the estate manager so why
[oh]

why
ya cause K
I don't want to take private okay <malay>aku tak nak</malay> stereotype [ah] but you look at the people who take private O level
[ha]
I I got that mindset [lah] last time

then might as well I just fully focus as a full-time student just retake
<malay>tebalkan muka</malay> [ah]
and apparently I I was the only one <malay>yang</malay> retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back <malay>malu</malay> I guess so ya [lah] <malay>tapi ustazah siapa</malay> #masniah# <malay>tak salah</malay>

previous seniors [ah] like they retake <malay>tapi</malay> they are exempted from
unnecessary modules [ah]

[a'ah] I tried my best to stay composed [lah] then after that (err) <malay>aku pun dah macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah</malay> start <malay>nangis</malay> then they started to cry <malay>aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam</malay> no no no no this this cannot <malay>dia</malay> they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up <malay>macam tersentuh</malay> [ah] and then automatically my <malay>air mata</malay> will <malay>mengalir</malay> you know so I was like then I was like quickly (err) (err) <malay>apa tu kasih suap</malay> then after that I just say (uh)
<malay>cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap</malay> [lah] so I went out of the room [lah] then when I went out the room
I then I just sat down outside and then I let them have their moment [lah] so they were talking and then the the the father of my friend and the mother came into the room and then they were taking picture and then there were more there was more crying and everything
and then <malay>kau tahu apa</malay> you know my mum's friend (um)
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya <malay>kiranya</malay> my my friend <malay>punya</malay> mum
mother [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> you know inside the room because you see [ah]
because <malay>yang sakit tu anak dia</malay> [tau] so <malay>bila</malay> so she is and then she's also <malay>sakit</malay> so when she will feel <malay>sedih</malay> you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition <malay>dia akan nangis</malay>
ya ya ya
[ah] yes yes yes that like she feel like <malay>macam anak dia akan pergi dulu</malay> you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then <malay>aku dekat dapur</malay> and then the mum would would like tell me [lah] like like you know (err) the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say (err)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>takde orang</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia kesian</malay> you know <malay>aku punya kawan macam dia</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang pun yang jaga dia</malay> it's like the father and the maid <malay>apa</malay> the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> so sometimes <malay>bila dia tak mampu</malay> to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first <malay>apa</malay> because the mother is the priority first <malay>apa</malay>
so you know at times <malay>kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa</malay> (err) <malay>dia pun</malay> sometimes will say you know like (err)
<malay>puas hati masukkan</malay> (err) dalam <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit</malay>
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but <malay>dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia</malay> so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already [ah] and then the mother the mother say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) she try to not enter the room [ah] because she will feel extra sensitive because (err) her her parents (err) no my friend's mum is around like seventy plus
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like <malay>macam golongan</malay> really <malay>yang orang tua</malay> [lah]
so sometimes <malay>bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> react with <malay>aku dah macam</malay> !huh! <malay>macam mana nak</malay> what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>cik sabar</malay> [lah] <malay>cik cik tahan</malay> [jer] [lah]
but even the the mum also say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the mum somehow I can feel like the mum <malay>macam</malay> somehow appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam akan cakap apa</malay> like what you tell me like (err)
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum <malay>macam</malay>
the mum really appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [ah] the mum <malay>macam</malay> sometimes I think the mum <malay>dia tersentuh</malay> [lah] and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything <malay>sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon</malay> [ah] <malay>tak silap</malay>
because they <malay>dia dia orang orang boyan</malay> I think <malay>boyan ke jawa</malay> I think (err) <malay>jawa jawa</malay> sorry <malay>dia orang orang jawa</malay>
the parents are <malay>orang jawa</malay> so so so <malay>nasi rawon</malay> is like a big thing [lah] so I didn't come on the day she <malay>masak</malay> cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tak dapat datang</malay> [ah] <malay>tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat</malay>
so the then the mum said [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cik masak</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu tapi tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang</malay> I'm like sorry [lah] <malay>cik</malay> K I mean

he always <malay>dia dia selalu ingat yang</malay>
<malay>yang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia</malay>

yup you don't apply in real life situation
that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system
but <malay>untuk</malay> I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
nothing has changed [eh] over the past how many years we've been living in singapore it is still the same concept of education and everything
it's like you know like the survival of the fittest [lah]
(err) the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> study hard apostrophe
will progress <malay>kuat juga</malay> then the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak</malay> progress are the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> mediocre
will just fought out in society <malay>aku masih ingat</malay> (err) I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher (err) he
ya ya he say (err) work hard or work in mcdonald's
[ah] now when I think about him [ah] when I think about that statement [ah] about what he made at last time [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh] you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad [ah] you you are that [ah] that
<malay>macam</malay> his statement [ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> sense of <malay>macam</malay> elitism you know <malay>macam macam macam</malay> how our (err) government [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> that kind of it's like the vibe right there the <malay>dia kasih</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> very similar to how the government <malay>macam</malay> how the government is like [lah] so <malay>aku fikir</malay> [eh] you mean <malay>apa yang</malay> people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful <malay>padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini</malay> they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> content with what they have so
<malay>betul betul betul</malay>
understood understood understood
[ah]
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay (err) honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's [ah] we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly (um)
K initially (err) this is like my third (err) application to you know [ah] sorry should I should not mention the name [lah]
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so (um) so before I went there in my head I always thought <malay>macam</malay> able to [kan] <malay>aku nak belajar kat sana</malay> then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive [lah] in the beginning [lah] or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore [kan] <malay>pakai</malay> cambridge [kan] and <malay>sana</malay> they have their own system [tau] [ah] for <malay>apa tu macam</malay> for how to grade and grading and everything
and then <malay>kat sana aku perasan</malay> !wah! the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart [eh] we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know <malay>macam</malay> ones from #sabah# with the ones from #johor#
the ones from #perak# like <malay>aku dah aku</malay> I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but <malay>aku</malay> realize about them is what they lack is
(um)
they are they are very (err) examination based <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is <malay>macam</malay> hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is <malay>macam</malay> (err) the examination is (err) it's it's it's it's very straightforward [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like (err) those <malay>yang macam</malay> (err) critical thinker
is <malay>tak banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>kat sana</malay>
the ones <malay>yang</malay> critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones <malay>yang</malay> from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question <malay>yang macam</malay> critic <malay>yang macam</malay> higher thinking [ah]
but because our our education system is <malay>dah macam</malay> nurture us like this [kan] but <malay>bila</malay> when we go there <malay>dia orang</malay> think <malay>yang kita ni</malay> super on [tau]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> !huh! super on [eh] not really [leh] it's just that (uh) our just that our culture <malay>macam</malay> singapore culture has trained us to be like this <malay>macam</malay> and then some more you have to understand <malay>aku kat sana aku</malay> pay <malay>enam ribu</malay> [eh]
almost to like a nine K [eh] (err) nine K of (err) school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
so every hour and every minute <malay>tu bagi aku</malay> is <malay>duit</malay> so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like <malay>macam</malay> when [ah] so sometimes they they the malaysian <malay>kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> they are quite intimidated [lah] even my classmate also told me [ah] <malay>yang</malay> the very first time they met me they she feels that I am <malay>aku sombong aku</malay> arrogant <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] serious [ah]
she say [ah] <malay>engkau macam poyo</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> serious [ah] <malay>poyo</malay>
[ah] <malay>poyo</malay> then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with <malay>aku</malay> I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my <malay>kepala</malay> would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior [lah] because you are overseas [mah] you're like you need to hustle <malay>apa</malay> and then then
when it comes to studies wise (err)
#alhamdulillah# I would say that I am coping very well [lah] I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that <malay>aku</malay> drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second (um)
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself (err) then I was not really focused [ah] like I still remember like the day before the exam <malay>baru aku nak belajar</malay> can you imagine
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of (err) I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ya <malay>yang</malay> answer script
[ah]
[ah] it's like a <malay>macam</malay> (err) I based (err) meaning [ah] I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same [ah] like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me [lah] [ah] who has studied in
so and then I saw in (err) semester three I told myself no I cannot
(um) [ah] in semester three I was very low key <malay>nak mampus</malay> [tau] <malay>aku macam aku</malay> every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet (uh) I even like (um) <malay>tak</malay> post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key [ah]
and then my my results was #alhamdulillah# I mean I I was quite surprised [ah] that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten [lah]
ya and then this coming semester four <malay>pun</malay> (err) <malay>aku</malay> hopefully [lah] I can get a (err) very good [lah] but all in all <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> I mean
I don't know I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> but but you see [ah] I I remember that time [ah] <malay>aku baru balik dari</malay> #kedah# [tau] <malay>nak balik</malay> (err) <malay>pergi</malay> <malay>tak silap</malay> <malay>ke</malay> singapore (uh)
and then (err) I remember sitting with this (err) with this lady [lah] she is (err) from #penang# you know she no no I I I went #penang# sorry ya I went #penang# and then I was on my way back from #penang# to singapore via flight so there was this (err) lady that I I sat beside and then (err)
when I because I was sitting at the window seat right so when I say (err) excuse me (err) then (err) then so when I enter (err) and sit and when I seated here now
you know she automatically she ask me [eh] you singaporean [ah]
then <malay>aku dah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana kau tahu</malay> then she say [oh] I know [lah] because of your accent and the way you talk
<malay>aku dah</malay> !wow! I'm shocked man
ya you can tell [ah] you can tell from a from a

but her brother actually (err) studies in and (err) did (err) did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl (err) so to cut the story short <malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> [lah] [eh] (uh) you [kan] <malay>orang melayu kenapa</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> stay <malay>kat</malay> malaysia (err) I think you should
(err) take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking [eh] <malay>apa dia cakap tu</malay> maybe there is a certain truth you know because <malay>kat sana aku perasan orang melayu</malay> !wah! babe privilege babe

yes yes yes exact <malay>bumiputera</malay> thing
yes yes <malay>betul betul betul</malay> then <malay>aku cakap</malay> [lah] [eh] but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then (err) <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] I was very frank with her I told her (err) you know how <malay>kat sini kita</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> casing <malay>kita punya bangsa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tindaskan</malay>
(err) or we are being like extra [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> not extra [lah] we're just being (err) we are we we we're looked down
<malay>tapi kat sana</malay> it's (err) it's <malay>bangsa dia orang yang</malay> look down <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] so <malay>dia macam terbalik</malay> (err) <malay>macam dia</malay> (err) <malay>aku cakap dengan</malay> very frank [ah] then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya I <malay>faham</malay> I <malay>faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat</malay> is not
(err) every everyone is kind of like taken care of [lah] I would say I mean I do not know I mean I I I've been staying there for like almost (err) three three three years plus now (err) it's good ya it and (err) I find that
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city [lah] but the expenses there is <malay>mahal nak mampus</malay>
I find like <malay>macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang</malay> the shampoo body shower [oh] !wah! I tell you <malay>mahal sangat macam satu</malay>
one body shower <malay>macam</malay> dove [eh] twenty four #ringgit# [eh] !siala! twenty four #ringgit# when you pay when you pay fifty #ringgit# to pay for the twenty four #ringgit# and when you left with that balance [eh] <malay>macam kiwak macam</malay> [eh] this is very expensive [leh] but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot [kan] then it's like worth it [kan] <malay>padahal</malay> it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether

ya and (err) this course is like it appeals to me [lah] because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>banyak benda</malay> is like about technology [kan] so ya I feel like this course (uh) actually benefit me [lah] in the future
(mm)
(oo) so

I did was (uh) design and colour so I do like graphic designs and stuff and I also (uh) besides coding I also learn (uh) concept
ideation so <malay>macam kita belajar macam mana nak</malay> (uh) brainstorm ideas (uh) for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so (uh) for you [ah] you said you were in like (um) marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules <malay>yang kau</malay> enjoy
(oo) that's not bad
yeah that's poly life man like most of the time you are just like spending time with your friends doing project work
internship [eh]
[oh]

<malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
!wah!
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation <malay>macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so <malay>susah tak macam kerja</malay> like in a like a team
like during that that test
[oh] right
(mm)
[oh]
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well [lah]
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
<malay>boleh boleh buat kerja</malay>
then (uh) (uh) besides <malay>sekolah</malay> [kan] like what what do you like to do <malay>macam</malay> do you have <malay>macam</malay> other hobby <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>apa apa benda</malay> [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school <malay>pastu ada apa</malay> O level <malay>abeh</malay> stress <malay>takle fikir</malay> yeah
[oh] during my free time I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) draw I also like to (err) <malay>tengok apa ni</malay>
[ah] anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because <malay>takde</malay> time [kan] poly <malay>dalam</malay> I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to (uh) do my hobbies which is kind of (uh) <malay>macam sedih</malay> but yeah so
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally (uh) do (uh) my hobbies
yeah
yep
actually <malay>ada banyak</malay> plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
go for the trials (err) because I (um) I'm actually afraid of rejection
but (um) I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then (um) maybe in (uh) (um) year two then I will start <malay>macam</malay> join like start trying out for [ah] I've actually picked
<malay>macam</malay> a few is (err) firstly is [ah] floorball like (um) <malay>aku kata tadi</malay> [kan] as I've mentioned (uh) floorball and then second was silat
and then third is <malay>dikir barat</malay> ya but
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
ya it is it is that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm like a bit <malay>takut</malay> to (um) you know join their team because (err) <malay>macam dorang nya</malay> expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet <malay>dorang nya</malay> expectations
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then (um) so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
!wah! how was it
but I think right I think confirm <malay>boleh</malay> pass <malay>punya</malay> confirm
yeah
[oh] for what
[oh] <malay>mesti sakit</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>banyak</malay>
[ah]
yeah
(mm)
then the the surgery <malay>bila</malay>
[oh]
!wow!
ya man I can't imagine myself
!wah! all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then <malay>dia</malay> <malay>dia kata</malay> like
(um) it's actually not that painful [lah] because like you know they put you in (uh) on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you <malay>bangun</malay> so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think [ah] after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you <malay>tak nak</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> side effects [kan] so ya
then
(uh) other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so (uh) how
how how how would you feel like <malay>macam</malay> you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like <malay>macam</malay> like your feeling
[oh]
yeah
(uh) I've never I've never <malay>apa ni</malay> had any surgeries before
I
I can't imagine the <malay>macam dia nya</malay> sakit
[eh] then [oh]
[eh] you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
[ah] small business
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I never say
no no no you you meant [ah] calligraphy is it
[oh] yeah yeah
ya ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> during my free time cause [ah]
<malay>apa ni</malay> I I love doing calligraphy right so I like <malay>macam</malay> I have I have like a mini business where
I (uh) <malay>buat</malay> calligraphy on <malay>orang punya macam</malay> notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like (um) quite a reasonable price [lah] so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
(uh) I like !aiya! basically like (um) doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>buat</malay> this business because
cause a lot of people [kan] you know singaporeans [kan] <malay>diorang suka macam</malay> study [kan] then <malay>banyak orang suka buat macam</malay> notebook <malay>diorang macam cantik cantik</malay> so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that <malay>diorang ada macam</malay> motivation to <malay>belajar</malay>
yeah [eh]
[kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID [kan] so like (uh) <malay>kat dalam rumah</malay> what do you do
(mmhmm)
ih
(oo)
!wah! !wah! tell me more
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also <malay>macam</malay> a good way [lah] for <malay>orang</malay> to you know <malay>macam</malay> get that extra cash
then like after after <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan]
you where's where's the first place <malay>yang</malay> you want to travel
yup
list them all
[oh]
[oh]
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
and remember <malay>yang kita semua jatuh sakit</malay> after we played at the beach
true
ya
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach <malay>semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit</malay>
yeah hopefully once like <malay>macam</malay> the border [dah] <malay>buka</malay> then we can go
ya
ya true true
!wah! for me right
after <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is (uh) <malay>mana ni</malay> Japan
yes
I've been there <malay>bila</malay> when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so <malay>macam tak ingat</malay> (uh) I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna <malay>macam</malay> go there again and then <malay>macam</malay> like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also <malay>macam</malay> if it's like an interesting country [ah] <malay>macam menarik</malay> you know <malay>pasal</malay>
like because (uh) I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there <malay>macam</malay> collect <malay>diorang nya apa ni</malay> figurine because like <malay>banyak orang kata macam</malay>
is <malay>macam</malay> quite cheap [ah] so I was like okay [ah] then I I think if if cause I like to collect
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
!wah! I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator [eh] with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
the the work is <malay>macam</malay> due next week [kan] then I would only do it like <malay>macam tiga hari</malay> before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too <malay>macam penat nak buat buat</malay> the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
[oh]
(mm)
ya (uh) me also like most of the time is always like cause I
always use my I'm on my handphone <malay>asyik tengok</malay> Instagram <malay>semua</malay> then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like [oh] [dah] <malay>lambat</malay> [ah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [lah] <malay>besok boleh buat</malay>
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
(uh) it can be done but it's just very hard
<malay>macam</malay> like group projects [eh]
[oh] recently I I <malay>ada macam</malay> this one (err) group project like I just finished <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>dua</malay> weeks <malay>lepas</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> it's called studio project so it's basically like because (uh)
my course is interaction design [kan] so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm (uh) ideas together and then come up with like (uh) a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting [lah] because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
(uh) how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
so my group <malay>kita buat</malay> we did this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and <malay>macam</malay> the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very <malay>susah</malay> app
to <malay>pakai</malay> because ya it's only my first year and then is also my <malay>macam</malay> my first time [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> then it's like <malay>susah</malay> [ah] then like all my other friends <malay>macam</malay> they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story <malay>macam</malay> interesting [ah] so like when users (uh) see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like <malay>macam</malay> arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next (uh) page or something so that's like <malay>macam</malay> there's an interaction there
ya that's about it
for you [eh]
(mm)
why kay you tell me
how #rabak#
!wah! I legit also don't like this type of people [leh] like they really make my blood go up [eh] like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to [ah] take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
[oh]
[oh] that's interesting
[ah] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] that's good that's good
yeah
[oh]
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app [ah] because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good (um) for me I think your app is very beneficial [lah] for people yeah
(oo) that's good
ya ya ya very interesting [eh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
!wah!
that's cool
Animal Crossing is a very in game now [eh] a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> like <malay>semua main</malay> [ah] then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
(mm)
!wah!
ya ya ya very interesting
<malay>macam</malay> look forward to [ah]
!wah! that that's quite a handful you got you got <malay>banyak</malay> project to <malay>apa ni buat</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
yeah it's good also because like [kan] year three we <malay>ada</malay> internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for (um) <malay>untuk</malay> like the company before <malay>diorang</malay> accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like <malay>diorang</malay> we're just like straight away <malay>masukkan</malay> you inside there but I didn't know like you have to <malay>macam</malay> go through an interview so I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite it's quite beneficial [lah] like <malay>apa diorang</malay>
<malay>ajar</malay> teach <malay>kat dalam</malay> yeah
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
(mm)
I also had like a similar a similar module I did <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) previously
where also same it's called (uh) effective effective (err) communication skill so <malay>diorang ajar macam mana</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know (err) if (err) communicate effectively and how to like you know gain (uh) confidence
and what are some of the
the like
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to <malay>macam macam</malay> you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting [ah] but <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me [ah] from someone who is actually <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who (err) is (uh) confident enough [ah] to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
[oh] ya
ya
!wah! actually I make friends very instantly [eh] it's like ya because (err) okay the good thing about technology is that (err)
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school [lah] so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
and <malay>macam</malay> it's like quite cool [lah] because like then you can <malay>macam cari orang</malay> in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me (err) there's this <malay>macam ada</malay> this (uh) girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like [eh] I heard you're in the in the same course
then (uh) she's like (uh) let's be friends [ah] then from there (uh) we started being friends [ah] then (err) when during poly because (err) mostly it was on Zoom right because of <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation <malay>semua</malay> so everything <malay>macam</malay> is online
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya so (err) ya then (err) in school like when we <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for <malay>macam</malay> many years
ya so it was like quite easy [lah] in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing <malay>macam susah</malay> is that (uh) is like the modules [ah] because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never <malay>macam</malay> done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
ya
you [eh] what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
!wah! my one don't have [eh] cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad [leh]
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like <malay>macam</malay> party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
[oh]
!huh! really [ah]
[oh]
[oh] I see I see
[oh] I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I I think not bad [leh] the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time (um) my I had I had this (uh) program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours [lah] then you will get the
<malay>macam</malay> the badge <malay>gitu</malay> so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift [one] [ah] so it's not bad [ah] <malay>tapi panas gila</malay>
it was so hot
and the and the worst thing [kan] towards the is <malay>tengah puasa</malay> you know <malay>tengah puasa</malay> then like me and my friend <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak</malay>
then we then <malay>kita</malay> almost <malay>batal</malay> [lah] my then my friend [dah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> take it [kan] then she was like [ah] <malay>batal</malay> [jer] [lah]
ya
eight hours was (uh) painful [lah] then <malay>kita jalan jalan</malay>
ya we we we we walked around the whole of #Tampines# ya but it was very very rewarding <malay>pasal</malay> (uh) at the end of the day <malay>kita dapat banyak</malay> donation
ya
(mm)
!huh! <malay>biar betul</malay>
right
!wah!
kay [lah] not bad you know at least you all <malay>macam</malay> you know like put money inside [lah] donate also
ya
but if you were to do <malay>macam</malay> flag day again would you do it
really ya it is
[oh] ya ya I've done the morning shift [one] before it's very very tiring
<malay>penat</malay> I couldn't <malay>macam buka my mata</malay>
ya it was during <malay>bulan puasa</malay>
ya
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>tempat yang ada</malay> shade [kan] already [dah] <malay>ada orang</malay> so me and my friend like <malay>macam terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>kita stand</malay>
under the hot sun then collect [lor] but that spot was the best cause <malay>banyak orang lalu sana</malay> so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like !alamak! shouldn't have told them
[oh] maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad [lah] this COVID there [ah] spoil all the plan [eh] then like legit man then [ah] spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
ya true hopefully [lah] I I I really wish <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation will <malay>macam</malay> die down [ah] because it really affects [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> life
(mm)
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
[oh] have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction [lah] television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
(uh) the other twin his ukrainian
(um) she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised (uh) she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress (uh) tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
(um) (uh) who is one of the clones [lah]
then she always (uh) live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming (uh) compared to season two and season four
(mm) I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones (uh) usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this [lah]
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember [lah] because this is the current show I'm watching now
(um)
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it [lah] so you won't get (err) you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil [lah] because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended (uh) without spoiling it for you
(err) I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes (uh) actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's (uh) probably safe to check out [ah] because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
foodpanda <malay>dah takde agaknya asal nak</malay>
[oh] you mean that time (uh) <malay>masa masa</malay> (uh) <malay>masa</malay> collect that time [eh] <malay>takde</malay> that time when I collect [kan] <malay>takde orang pun dah habis dah dia orang cakap ada seribu</malay> [jer] helmet

[oh] okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout [lah]
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse (uh) them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like (uh) draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you [lah] I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your (uh) interview outfit
(um) don't need tie [ah] I guess (err) maybe just a formal wear including (uh) smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive (uh) and also be open [lah]

[oh] I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's [ah] creepier and more real it's (um) it's not is not a comedy like orange orange [kan] orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent [ah] ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for (uh) (uh) why you like
[oh] (um) I mean for me (err) I'm waiting for money heist (uh) wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons [ah]
ya [ah] ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya (uh) my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show (uh) I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
[oh] ya
(mm)
ya ya
[oh] so you think you like a professional critic [ah]
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about (uh) about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident (uh) #raquel# losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real [lah] if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season (uh) but it was very entertaining to me [ah] also quite compelling and way better in spanish (um) ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
(uh) (uh) the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this (uh) money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions [ah] but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated [lah] anyway so today is twelve twelve (uh) sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full (uh) a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
(mm) I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at (uh) ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of (uh) sneakers on sale
(mm)

[ah] see how [lah] if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers <malay>ke</malay> or I will buy the cinema vouchers
no I'm busy (mm) I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding [ah] strider balance bike for #azam#
second
(uh) carousell so I found one (uh) (uh) that can deal at #buangkok# but (uh) he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
[oh] okay [lah] why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay [lah] firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand (uh) second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but (uh) the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly [lah]
it depends on his father's (uh) interests and free time
ya so have you thought about #azri's# suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
(uh) if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in (uh) government sector uniform group like (uh) prison service (uh) (um) I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive [eh] but you need to read more [lah] you need to do more research (uh) but there's bond [lah] I think (err) since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this (uh) uniform group then you should (uh) still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself [ah] that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
(uh) I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya (mm)
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
[oh] so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
(uh) their degree are sponsored by the company [ah] ya I mean like for example (um)
(mm)
so rolls royce pay for his degree
[oh] that's good so (uh) as he get as he [ah] got the degree right so did his salary also (uh) goes up went up
[oh] okay that's good can I ask what is his position
[oh] okay five years [eh] (mm) so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his (uh) recommendation do you don't you want to work there
[oh] okay okay
(mm) interesting rolls royce okay
[oh] so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him [lah] you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so !wah! when he joined what was his (uh) education (uh) certificate diploma so so he join (uh) it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant (uh) then he gets to stay there with his family
(mm) ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house [lah] well that's good that's good so so he so he's (uh) he told you that he signed bond for five years with (uh)
five years okay so (uh) is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree [oh] okay I think (uh) singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face [ah]
[oh] it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but [ah] but who will pay for this (uh) school the company or the company will reimburse
[oh] that's good
if you have to stay until the company
(mm) that means (err) work and study [ah] ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
[oh] really you think so

and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal

after this are you going to sleep
(hmm)
(hmm)
you know #hanis# never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me [eh]
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want [lah]
too lazy to talk to her
!hais!
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how #rina# always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from #sonya# that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know #hanisah#
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one [lah] down there right and then after that #rina# (uh) (uh) recently only (um) enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then <malay>nak kena</malay> go and study
they have leadership this leadership program [lah] basically but like
(um) #sofia# and #rina# said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked #hanisah# how long are you bonded with the school [lah] and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her [ah] because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her [lah] the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing [lah] but you think #hanisah# is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not [lah] but it's not worth it I think it's very <malay>bodoh</malay>
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only [ah] ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand [ah] like twenty two thousand I can understand [lah] but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already [lah] anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true [what] like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her [lah] I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with #sufian# and #rina# [what] like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare [lah] she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense [what]
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand [eh]
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know [lah]
I don't know at first she didn't tell me [lah] today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know [lah] is it
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then <malay>tak payh tak payah nak</malay> leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no [what]
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say [ah] who knows #rina# she say this you know who knows #rina# have something planned for me like dude
even if #rina# has something planned for you #rina# is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different [eh] in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss #saba#
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know <malay>itu pun</malay> so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread <malay>macam roti</malay>
[a'ah] during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also <malay>nakal</malay> [ah] but the girl quite angel [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> devil [lah] [kan] but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible [lah]
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents [ah] but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the [lah] what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see [lah] and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like [lah] and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know [ah]
and okay okay ya

I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> if there

<malay>tahan</malay>
there's not much escalator there's a lot of stairs

(err) I'm fine thank you
ya
(um) I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about (um)
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me (um)
(ugh)
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like (err) couple
so <malay>dia orang</malay> like (um)
<malay>dia orang</malay> want to <malay>dia orang</malay> exit already <malay>tapi dia orang nak masuk balik</malay> so when they want to <malay>masuk balik</malay> and then like the security guard stop them [lah]
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but <malay>dia orang</malay> like (um)
they insisted coming in [lah] and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they block the way and then this security guard was like (um) he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched [lah] <malay>lepas tu dia</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> couple <malay>tak</malay> happy [lah] <malay>habis tu dia orang</malay> (um) so like the security guard
[ah] redirected to me and then like I I I ask [lah] hi sir how may I help you
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] like I <malay>nak pergi beli</malay> (uh) I <malay>nak pergi ambil</malay> allen key
[ah] <malay>dia nak pergi ambil</malay> allen key [lah] <malay>daripada dia punya</malay> service counter <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
after they take the like they want to take the allen key <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [eh] (err) please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's <malay>dia orang punya pasal</malay> [lah]
(err) when when they left I ask this security guard [lah] like you know (um) like <malay>tak kisah pasal dia orang</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> (um) they they were trying to be difficult [lah] because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so <malay>lepas tu</malay> another security guard <malay>datang lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] (err) this couple [lah] they have a problem [lah] they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark [lah] why why
why (um) why do you (err) (err) how did he touch in the first place <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>dia dah cakap lepas tu</malay> they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer [lah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
(um) and so (err)
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
[eh] <malay>tak boleh cakap nama dia</malay>
<malay>tak boleh cakap nama</malay> store
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
<malay>tapi</malay> like you are not supposed to eat there [lah] because
<malay>takut</malay> you expose yourself to
at your you're risking yourself [lah] to exposure to virus so
ya [lah] <malay>lepas tu dia</malay> argued <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
<malay>lepas tu</malay> we're like no
no eating in the store at all you know
rude [lah] so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like (um) like we don't have a like (um) like we are like lower than them
correct ya so (err)
ya then the day before it was quite funny because (um) there was this (err) couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in !hey! but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then (um) ya so they were they came in and
(err) I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like !hey! why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
<malay>jadi dia cakap</malay> [lor] you know like (um)
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like (err) she was like [oh] like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
(mmhmm)
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time [ah] they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards (um) crane operators (err) tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down <malay>kat rumah</malay> and then like <malay>melepak tengok</malay> <malay>tengok</malay> youtube <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay> so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
(mm) (mm)
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
(mmhmm)
!wah! that is late
(mm)
my alarm [lah] [oh] my god
you know that's a typical (um) an (err) reaction from old people the audience be like
[oh] like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like <malay>pahala</malay> I'm like sometimes [kan] you <malay>buat kerja bukan pasal pahala</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja pasal</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> care for the person you know
<malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tengah</malay> cleaning <malay>buntut lagi</malay>
you <malay>nangis</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>nangis ke tak</malay>
your mum's friend
okay
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> birth to <malay>anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu</malay> kind of thing
(mm)
(mmhmm)
correct
!wow! <malay>nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa</malay> [tau]
(mm)
!aduh!
(mm) (mm)
that is right
correct
(mm)
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
(mm)
(mm)
you <malay>tahu kenapa tak pasal</malay> I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so <malay>kalau</malay> you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
<malay>tapi</malay> like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things <malay>macam</malay> even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like [oh] I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop [lah] or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like <malay>memang</malay> like I think it's just human nature [lah] like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
#alhamdulillah#
<malay>tu memang dah macam amanah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia sedekah gaji itu</malay> [kan]
(mm) #alhamdulillah# <malay>banyak rezeki</malay>
you <malay>macam</malay> <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) in debts [lah]
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share [lah] we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you [lah] as of now [lah]
ya because like I mean like for
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like <malay>kalau</malay> is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like (um)
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes [lah] like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like (um) I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it [lah] in terms of like
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>bila dia dia dah nak meninggal</malay> [kan] <malay>habis</malay> you <malay>ada kat sana</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at the same time [meh] <malay>pasal dia punya</malay> selfish thoughts <malay>macam begitu</malay> he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like <malay>bila dia dah meninggal</malay> like you have to live your life and his [ah] if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to <malay>jaga dia bila masa</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak belajar</malay>
<malay>lagipun dia ada banyak</malay> family around here daddy is swag
like
correct because I mean I understand [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> family [kan] <malay>tapi tak</malay> close <malay>dengan</malay> family <malay>tu macam</malay> like <malay>saudara saudara tak tak rapat</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> like (um) in terms of helping right ya [lah] like that [lah] but like like you just have to help your family [lah] you know
like my (um) my side of the family is like <malay>kalau ada kerja kahwin</malay> or <malay>kenduri</malay> right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup [lah] blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
<malay>lepas tu</malay> like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point [kan] they will like going to get married soon they'll like [eh] <malay>nanti bila kita kahwin</malay> (uh)
<malay>kau orang suka tolong-tolong</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti kita</malay> (err) <malay>kita kahwin kau orang tolong</malay> [ah] this kind of things it's like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not (um)
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
I don't think that's how you should behave [lah] because then you see the core of your personality you know <malay>lepas tu</malay> like this particular cousins they are like always
[ah] even when there is a wedding they <malay>tak datang</malay> on time <malay>dia orang datang lambat</malay> even the people that they're supposedly close to [ah] like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin <malay>pun datang lambat</malay> so I feel like <malay>ni apa punya</malay> attitude <malay>ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin</malay> and they're going to breed this kind of
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before [lah] like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like [oh] my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and (um)
(um) for me because (um)
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home [lah] which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of (err)
job but (err) my step mum <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak</malay> then I'm like ya <malay>cukup cukup cukup</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like I told you before right like my father <malay>memang apa macam babi</malay> like you know like he fucking like (um) <malay>tengok</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay> youtube every single day <malay>pukul</malay>

after that <malay>ustazah</malay> he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I <malay>ustazah</malay> say [lah] like like you know like
(err) <malay>perlahan-perlahan</malay> [lah] <malay>baca</malay> [lah] <malay>kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau</malay> (err) <malay>perlu</malay> (err) <malay>ulang</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi tapi</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main</malay> video <malay>saya tak boleh</malay> concentrate <malay>lepas tu ustazah macam</malay> awkward [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay
ya correct (mm) and then like
for me right my my <malay>bapa</malay> is
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
<malay>macam dia</malay>
<malay>macam pemalas</malay> [jer] <malay>gila babi</malay> [tau]
like <malay>satu dia</malay> like <malay>dah lama tak kerja</malay> and he's just (err) waiting for government to give him money
and then like (um) (err) what do you call that like <malay>dia tengok</malay> youtube videos every single day <malay>pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh</malay> on <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
(um) electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months <malay>habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak kerja</malay> then (um) ya then I just keep quiet [lah] like it's your problem [what] I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever [lah] you know
like you you figure your shit out [lah]
my mum know [lah] that he doesn't work [lah]
that's why she divorce him [lah]
you know
when I was in (err) primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long (um)
since I was in primary two [ah] I don't know eight years old (um) now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no [lah] she remarried and then (um) she divorced when I was in ya
(mm)
ya then like #alhamdulillah# like long time [lah] but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family [lah] and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said [eh] (err) I'm going to I'm going to the food court [lah] to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
(err) he got his heartbroken and <malay>dia dia nak</malay> console [lah] <malay>kawan dia</malay> [lah]
<malay>lepas tu kawan dia punya</malay> crush
(err) slept with [eh] will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me [lah] I like <malay>dia tu bukan</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> girlfriend couple <malay>dia punya</malay> crush <malay>sahaja</malay> you you <malay>nak</malay> sad sad <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam</malay>
you <malay>nak</malay> (um) act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
<malay>lepas tu</malay> my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that (uh) [oh] <malay>kawan dia</malay> actually <malay>kaya dia macam</malay> from a well to do family [lah] [lah] [lah] [lah]
do you know what my father say he say (um) [oh] <malay>jadi kalau kalau adik kalau</malay> (um) <malay>pergi keluar dengan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja</malay> coke <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
<malay>lepas tu macam mana</malay> you <malay>tak darah</malay> up [kan] so I <malay>darah</malay> up I <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau nak kalau nak</malay> [ah] <malay>jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap dia macam nak</malay> weekend excuse [lah] <malay>macam dia</malay> joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
<malay>lepas tu</malay> what the
ya I mean like fuck man like <malay>dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak</malay> my father [lah] <malay>dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pemalas</malay>
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and (um)
put clothes in the the washing machine and then (err) <malay>gantung</malay> which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like <malay>kerja</malay> (um) <malay>kemas rumah masak lipat baju</malay> #makingkan# <malay>dia kopi</malay>
I mean (mm) <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you old school [kan] you <malay>kerja apa</malay>
<malay>jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi</malay> [tau] and then I even have like I'm working with a guy (um) this <malay>pakcik</malay> he's about seventy plus seventy two
<malay>dia masih kerja</malay> I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty [lah] this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
and like he's working
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to <malay>macam kasih dia duit</malay> you know what you mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok dia</malay> unproductive I <malay>rasa macam beban</malay> [tau] like
sometimes I really like
like just (err) pray to god [lah] #alhamdulillah# my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know (err) one funny day (err) my youngest sister told me she's like
[oh] <malay>kakak</malay> you know (err) we were talking about how when you die right and then (um) (um)
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the <malay>bumi</malay> right
my step mum <malay>cakap dia tak nak jumpa</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay>
ya [lah] so in <malay>bumi</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> mark like husband and wife right <malay>tapi</malay> in <malay>syurga</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you you still want to be together or not
[ah] my mum say <malay>tak nak</malay> myself say
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
I can see sometimes he's caring but [ah] as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that <malay>macam</malay> became <malay>geram</malay> became <malay>macam kau dah</malay> [lah] <malay>pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau</malay> also <malay>nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa</malay>
<malay>lagipun</malay> right half of our lives he never raise us and !huh! correct <malay>dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak</malay> expect <malay>kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke</malay> correct
I mean we don't think like that [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum <malay>macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>nanti</malay> (err) <malay>ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit</malay>
ya so for me right usually <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak kasih</malay> I <malay>kasih</malay> my step mum <malay>lebih macam</malay> say
when I was working my full time job [lah] I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so (um) ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
he also likes to count people's money (mm) <malay>macam dia cakap</malay> [oh] like your sister (mm) <malay>dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua</malay> like <malay>berapa ribu</malay> [lah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he like to compare [oh] <malay>kalau</malay> your sister <malay>kerja dekat</malay> singapore the versus your (err) brother-in-law who's who <malay>kerja dekat</malay> malaysia <malay>dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa</malay>
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that [lah]
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that <malay>sekarang</malay> can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying (err) meaning <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>bila kasih</malay> I <malay>duit macam gitu</malay>
like <malay>itu yang kasih</malay> you <malay>marah</malay> because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
was to like maybe set up a (mm) maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident [lah] but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right <malay>jadi</malay> (um) my step mum <malay>yang yang</malay> he was refusing to give
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
because he like calculative say [oh] you from the <malay>kampung</malay> you indonesian [lah] blah blah blah <malay>balik kau punya kampung</malay> blah blah blah blah blah blah <malay>kalau aku tak kahwin kau</malay>
like you <malay>punya</malay> life <malay>tak</malay> better [lah] blah blah blah blah
<malay>macam gitu sampai sekarang</malay> [tau] <malay>dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran</malay> [kan] I <malay>tak suka</malay>
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him [lah] even though because at one time [lah] they wanted to divorce then we we advise them [lah] like as the older children we advise them to stay together [lah] if they if they can
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you <malay>tak nak</malay> you <malay>nak duit</malay> delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother <malay>pun macam</malay> I <malay>rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay> [tau] like <malay>dia selalu dia cakap</malay> (mm)
why are we born in a poor family
<malay>lepas tu</malay> me and my eldest sister we're like <malay>kau boleh</malay> born <malay>dalam</malay> poor family <malay>tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya</malay> problem
<malay>allah dah kasih kau banyak</malay> avenue <malay>untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak</malay> blame <malay>orang lain</malay>
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those (err) chinese people in society where they say [oh] I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
(um) on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
and like (err) play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged [eh] and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that <malay>jadi</malay> I feel like !wah! <malay>kenapa</malay> [eh] like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
(mm)
ya so ya I mean I'm
<malay>tak tak tak</malay> I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better [lah] or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know man it's like
<malay>tapi</malay> sector <malay>macam mana</malay>
I <malay>tak boleh</malay> I teach drama and english before
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
(mm) which one the the guy [ah]
ya that bastard
that is true
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like [oh] I'm just contend with <malay>sederhana</malay> which I cannot relate to
ya but like (um) so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like (err) what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it [lah] until the time is up [ah]
book smart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
correct
<malay>poyo</malay> [siol]
(mm)
<malay>yang</malay> you <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>yang</malay> you what (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) this this answer thing is it like (um) it's like a notes for the exam [lah]
(mmhmm)
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
it is
but I would say it's because of (err) <malay>bumiputera</malay> but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay (mm) there's a difference
(mmhmm)
ya it's so fast right your time like [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where (um) a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like [oh] I convert
it's cheap [what] you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people [lah] like I tell you before right <malay>macam kalau</malay> you <malay>nak beli benda sana kalau</malay> you <malay>tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana</malay>
I <malay>keluarkan lima puluh ringgit</malay> I <malay>bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk</malay> shampoo is <malay>tak memadai</malay> it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
of course
(mm)
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
(mm)
<malay>dia tu yang yang itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) text you <malay>yang tanya</malay> is you

#sungei gedong# you <malay>tahu</malay> (um) <malay>kubur sana</malay>
<malay>kubur</malay>
like <malay>pusaraman</malay>
ya #lim chu kang# but <malay>lagi dalam</malay>
plus the
#choa chu kang# is very [what]
[ah] my house is very near to his workplace <malay>tapi takkan</malay> I <malay>nak duduk sana lima hari</malay> [kan]
which one my sister
[oh] my god no <malay>dia takkan kasi punya</malay> girl

(err) he will maybe <malay>pergi</malay> #nee soon# camp then it will be closer to his workplace already [eh] I mean his house <malay>tapi</malay>
ya #mandai# but it's <malay>lagi lama</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi</malay> maybe around one year one point five years

ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I <malay>belum kerja</malay> [seh] <malay>kita belum</malay> apply <malay>rumah belum kerja</malay> then you <malay>nak</malay> talk about having a car
!aiya!
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[a'ah] I think you you you <malay>nak kena fikir</malay> about it's not just about petrol [tau] about like <malay>dia punya</malay> season parking <malay>berapa dia punya</malay> road tax <malay>berapa</malay>
ya that's why <malay>dia punya</malay> season parking <malay>dia punya</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> what's that called [ah] road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like [ah]

(err) so I I just say that [lah] then <malay>dorang cakap</malay> (uh) they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay <malay>boleh kita boleh</malay> (err) have the wedding <malay>tapi</malay> all the social distancing shit [ah] you settle
ya so <malay>ambil</malay> temperature <malay>semua</malay> you settle
<malay>mana boleh gitu</malay> [sia] babe
ya is the is the catering [what] supposed to do is
ya
ya and then <malay>apa ni</malay> I paying you extra [tau] then after that <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>dia punya</malay> contract basically saying <malay>kalau betul</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> wedding <malay>ada</malay> (um) COVID case [ah] you <malay>kena</malay> handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> (um)
<malay>kita</malay> still <malay>akan</malay> cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to [ah] I'm still gonna give you [what] (uh) you paid for <malay>tapi</malay> everything else <malay>kau</malay> settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
they they wanted me to sign a a black and white stating this
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I <malay>tak</malay> go on [ah] then after that (uh) they I think <malay>dorang tak rugi sebab</malay> that time [kan] <malay>tutup</malay>
then <malay>dorang tak boleh beli</malay> their <malay>barang</malay> from there [what] so they have to buy it from singapore [what]
and then after that I <malay>cakap dengan dorang</malay> [lah] I give like <malay>kata putus</malay> like that I say (um)
<malay>kalau sampai</malay> end of the year [ah] I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money <malay>sebab</malay> if you think about it [eh] <malay>duit yang</malay> I down <malay>dengan dorang belum pakai</malay> [tau]
like you all <malay>tak beli barang basah</malay>
like basically you all <malay>tak tak tak pakai</malay> [ah] <malay>duit tu</malay>

enough for me to suffer losses [lah]

ya
so <malay>dorang punya dorang punya</malay>
they say (um)
we will have the open date for you until two zero two one
ya
I'm not sure [eh] I don't know if I can sell my
I don't know <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>dah bayar</malay> up until the last payment so that [one] is the after after wedding
because the payment <malay>pasal dah nak dah nak</malay> my wedding [seh] <malay>masa tu</malay>

it's halal [kan]
no no no [eh] the glass noodle it's just flour right

okay so after that the third year <malay>engkau</malay> move out because with your aunty and then
(uh huh)
[ah]
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
ya but is it your own your own <malay>punya</malay> feeling or <malay>memang</malay> they are the one who gave you hints
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> when you go back that time (uh) like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
(mm)
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
ya ya but you and her now <malay>dah</malay> okay [lah]
like become such a cool mum [ah]
having disputes [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree [lah] you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life [lah] mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy [lah] you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my <malay>nakal</malay> my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school [lah] they get into they they start to steal from shop [lah] that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument [ah] so <malay>aku suka jawab</malay> [jer] you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum [lah] you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course [lah] you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you [lah] you know you ended up becoming a fight often [ah] but for our case is not religious matters [lah] for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche [lah] because she was a single mother for awhile
[ah] so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] ya ya so I can understand her stress [ah] she was the old school hard knocks kind [lah] you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind [lah] if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness [lah] so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and (um) I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
[ah] when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two (err) I stayed at (uh) you know those government rental house ya I I stayed (uh) using (uh) someone's name [lah] ya because that person had was sick so she (uh) the <malay>nenek</malay> like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus [lah] ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely [lah] I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area (uh) my my house was at outram there the old school #jalan kukoh# [lah] you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better [ah]
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot [lah] and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay (uh) when when I was in my early twenties <malay>kita</malay> actually <malay>nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah</malay> so by right we already moved to #yishun# way back already [tau] but then (err) this (err) it's a it's a chinese family [lah] so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house [ah] so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room [lah] my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us [lah] but you can feel [lah] after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like <malay>rimas</malay> if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate [lah] then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you [lah] the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight [lah] like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve [tau] but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her !alah! she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like <malay>kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke</malay> you know
yes
passionate [ah] <malay>kira</malay> defensive [ah]
grow up
ya
tense up [ah] [ah]
ya ya
fight [ah] ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing [ah] ya
ya ya
ya
[a'ah]
[ah]
probably probably ya
(mm)
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear [lah] [ah] if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why [ah] what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside [leh] you look soft outside and inside you are [eh] fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it [ah]
adamant [ah]
[oh] okay okay okay
ya
(mm)
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] you know what dude actually what right (uh) one thing you should actually I recommend [lah] you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book [ah] dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that [eh] no no some people actually (uh) you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique [lah] then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a !wah! dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what [lah] but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good [lah]
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook [ah] and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F [ah]
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example [lah] (uh) you know like how sometimes people (um) okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very #nya# one the #nya# one [ah] actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before [ah] !wah! sometimes when people in the level of managerial position [ah] are sometimes very #guai lan# you know bro <malay>dia orang</malay>
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel (um) wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the #mats# can walk like that or the #bengs# they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
ya [lah] but no [lah] I truly mean it empathise [lah] <malay>kau jangan ketawa</malay> now you make me feel bad for laughing
like !whoa! so big like they as if they got like big triceps [ah] that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also [lah] ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
[oh] really [ah]
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time [lah] [ah]
opening [ah] ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
[a'ah] then then then
I I think so [ah] why [ah] recall recall recall help me recall
[oh] ya okay okay then then then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
!oi! my memory very bad [lah] bro very bad bro (mm)
(mm)
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
[ah]
ya
ya
okay
something new [ah]
(oo)
[eh] but dude I thought all this while <malay>memang</malay> you were actually very motivated to be a pilot [what] no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
okay [ah]
ya ya you can like transfer [ah] ya
okay
[ha]
flying [ah] (mm)
[ah]
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about <malay>macam mana kau jadi</malay> pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid [tau] not the interest [tau] the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
okay
okay
okay
ya
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky [ah] that person should never have been a pilot [sia] but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
[oh] eventually they change [lah] when did they change
okay okay
(mm)
(mm) ya ya ya
okay
!wah! motivated like crazy [sia]
[oh] very young [ah]
[ah]
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
(uh huh)
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
okay
okay
let go [ah]
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying [ah] you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly [what] okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay [ah]
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength [ah] ya ya ya
[oh] but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career [lah] it's more of like (uh) okay okay not not so much of a mistake [lah] not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
[ah]
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
[ah]
okay
[ah]
(mm)
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
(oo) <malay>sayangnya</malay>
[oh]
[a'ah]
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
(mm)
okay
this was when [ah]
how you afford all these things man operation [lah] go [lah]
you loan [ah]
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
[eh] no [lah] because new house you say you use [mah] you don't have to cash contribute [what] <malay>ada</malay> how much
!oi! okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room [ah]
but you're
ya
[ah] who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
[eh] that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know [ah] it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no [ah]
just a cross [ah] [oh] okay
no you know why because I don't know [lah] it depends on my future [lah] because for now there's a lot of changes [ah] okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
#dubai# right #dubai# airline is it
[oh]
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience [ah]
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that [lah]
[ah]
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit [lah] ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry [lah] the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts [ah]
(mm)
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal [ah]
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
(mm)
!wah! how many airplanes [sia] bro like that
!wah! I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue [lah] like from steward to be flying [lah] okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is (uh) my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
[oh] you went through the three months [ah] [oh] it was supposed to be that stage already [lah] [oh]
!wah! dude that time if you fly [ah] your inter pretty stable and nice [ah] bro four to six K easily [sia]
[eh] but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know <malay>nasib kentang</malay> [eh] like like first okay [lah] the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID <malay>pula</malay> happen like !wow!
your <malay>nasib</malay> is so <malay>kentang</malay> [lah] dude
<malay>nasib kau sangat kentang</malay> bro I don't know why I say <malay>kentang</malay> [ah] but I feel like it sounds right <malay>nasib kau kentang</malay>
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike [ah]
ya ya
!walao! I don't think that's anywhere close [sia]
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there [sia] on the drone
okay
that's relatable [lah]
[ah] okay okay so it's just a matter of time [lah]
another <malay>ujian</malay>
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to #salihin# <malay>ni</malay> edwin <malay>jadi nyanyuk</malay> ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there <malay>orang yang dalam</malay> asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you [siol] [lah] funny [sia]
[siol] [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of #mumammad salihin#
ya then eventually when people see the peak [ah] [lah] it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession [eh] but okay [lah] but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story [lah] I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist [ah] so she's like a old lady [lah] you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage [lah] like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just <malay>macam</malay> smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya like for you you are like [oh] crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum [lah] so ya but but but no [lah] I I wish you all the best [ah] brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it [lah] it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field [oh]
(mm)
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him [ah] ya like before him right you see bush !wah! everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him [ah] the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman [lah]
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics [ah] in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no [lah] bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back [eh] okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that [lah] but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead [mah] like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks [what] the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people [lah] the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have #genghis khan# you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them [lah] you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that (um) people just have space to voice out things
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing [what] you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you <malay>kena</malay> arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you <malay>kena</malay> arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing [lah] as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see [lah]
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person [lah] how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now [lah] because if I go there I will die of boredom [sia]
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand [mah] so <malay>aku</malay> anytime can just like you know [eh]
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something [lah] but I'm not in touch with him that much [lah]
he's a new zealander but <malay>sekarang</malay> he stay in australia
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old [lah] I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains [ah] then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom [lah] there's nothing to do [sia] there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know [lah] okay
no it's not about <malay>mahal</malay> bro even if it's not <malay>mahal</malay> you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand <malay>macam mana</malay> if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example [lah] like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and (um) I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how [sia]
a plan [ah]
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business [lah] [oh] I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no [lah] basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay [lah] I will just give you a brief verbal presentation [ah] people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example [oh] bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why [oh] why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
[ah]
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much [mah]
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say [oh] my house will <malay>kena tarik</malay> they will say [oh] I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
the only reason how they can <malay>tarik</malay> your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
they will just cut your utility [lor]
ya
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house <malay>kena tarik</malay> not true okay number two (uh) you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy (uh) I give you one one scenario [lah] one of one of this person [oh] like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount [lah] so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay [lah] you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
because your will still cut [mah] <malay>bulan-bulan</malay> for the house [ah] okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you [ah] bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people [lah] okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole [lah] which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor [lah] okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk [mah] you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan [lah] okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets [lah] you know you buy Rolex [lah] you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there [mah]
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions [lah] your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong [lah] but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example [ah] they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government (uh) supreme court order you to pay [lah] like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone [lah] that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years [lah] depending on the amount that you have to pay (err) so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that [one] right they are the people like [ah] fuck it [lah] I don't want to pay <malay>aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat</malay> [ah] so if they never pay then they cannot travel
they have to stay in singapore [ah]
cannot [ah]
their their their passport is blocked [what] they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead [lah] you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go [lah] you know
ya
but it's not like so long in advance <malay>pun</malay> you know it's just like a day probably you know [ah] but the thing is people thought [oh] cannot that kind of thing
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you (uh) they cannot [lah] they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay [lah] they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy [ah] so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna (uh) work in production houses if the company feel like [eh] there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you [lor] private entity [what]
[ah] so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
[ah] like this kind of job [ah] the one that is got profile [one] [ah] they normally will not hire you [one]
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system [lah] ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests [ah]
ya [lah] for example okay I give you a scenario [ah] let's say you owe ten thousand [lah] the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred [lah]
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month [lah] okay
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will <malay>tambah balik</malay> one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario [lah] so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay [lah] let's say you you a newly married couple [lah] okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans [mah]
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial (uh) the debt trap [ah] okay so the second way is to pay a minimum [eh]
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay <malay>habis</malay> [kan] another thing [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the second way let's say <malay>macam</malay> the minimum [eh] some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the <malay>susu</malay> pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come [lah] lawyer letter come [lah]
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic [ah] this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see [lah] they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country [lah] [ah] so [ah] normally they have their debt consolidation plan [lah] that debt management program [lah] all these thing [lah] this is by the by the banks [lah] of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria [lah] you know you are [eh] <malay>aku rasa dah habis</malay> [ah] bro okay [lah] five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done [ah] okay

and at this time [leh] <malay>macam</malay>
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put (uh) a company's precedence over an individual

it's not even your fault [sia] it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been (uh) how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the <malay>majlis</malay> are over like you get <malay>duit salam</malay> you know
I told #aqil# I had no expectations like <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin</malay> [ah] but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time [ah] cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak nak macam</malay> okay I need to find a man <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh kahwin</malay> no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will (uh) fall into place [lah] like if if we <malay>kahwin</malay> then <malay>kahwin</malay> like but ultimately I feel like (uh) it's important that #aqil# and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting [ah] of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah]
[oh] you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
(err) like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
because we are exclusive <malay>kita tak cakap</malay> we we <malay>kita tak berbual dengan orang lain</malay> like we love each other like we see a future in each other <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so he say [ah] like let's celebrate or officiate (um) <malay>hujung tahun</malay>
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I <malay>tak biasa</malay> like him looking at my phone
he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> text he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I <malay>nak tengok</malay> your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all (ugh) in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
[oh] right so anyway like in december he <malay>kata</malay> like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I <malay>macam</malay> [oh] then he <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia dah</malay> start saving like he's very (uh) thrifty like
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him [lah] he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like [oh]
just like
I think it's quite cute [lah] like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right (um) the last girlfriend [ah] he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like [oh] so like to him it means a lot [lah] that he ask me then I was like [orh] okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
(um) also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with #hassan#
me I still have unresolved issues with #hassan#
like a lot of things happen because of him like <malay>macam</malay> me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
ya we're still not talking [tau] babe
then I was really sad cause during my birthday <malay>dorang tak</malay> wish I (um)
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover !wah! I felt like the shittiest daughter ever [sia] babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like [ah] loose threads or like (uh) consequences on some like those aftermath of me and #hassan# that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with #aqil# and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with #aqil# I want to be with #aqil# only and not have like [oh] this is because of #hassan# that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about #hassan# like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
I know like I know he's an adult like I know <malay>dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar</malay> like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
take care of himself
I think so [ah] because like he was a great boyfriend [sia] babe only things things messed up after the relationship
so like I was so sure of #hassan# [ah] I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him [oh] my god okay I <malay>nak bilang</malay> you something [ah] yesterday yesterday <malay>semalam</malay> I told #aqil# this I say I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> #aqil# (um)
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year [ah]
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way [sia] babe like
like the thing with #hassan# all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet #aqil# and this is going to happen
ya
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things (um) <malay>tertulis</malay> [ah] [lah] like is everything <malay>tertulis</malay> [what] like
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time [ah] babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and #aqil#
<malay>belum</malay> I <malay>belum</malay> delete I still I still <malay>masih ada kat</malay> phone
<malay>dekat my</malay> phone
<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tak tahu asal</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> delete
I I <malay>tak nak tengok</malay> [ah] the <malay>gambar-gambar</malay> like it makes
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
<malay>kau nak</malay> but
ya I don't know [ah] like
I mean I really really hope #hassan#
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness [ah] babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship [lah] after that I don't know what happened
right
(uh) after after #hassan#
cause you were still with #audi# and then like we went out remember you me #hassan# you me #hassan# #audi# ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so [eh] babe
(uh) like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like (um) cold like he's very (err) like
[ah] very action [ah]
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like (uh) when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then (err) he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder [ah] like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
that's like trying to be <malay>macam</malay> they are trying to
be someone that they're not
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) <malay>dah kahwin</malay> after a few after a few years <malay>dah penat</malay> like pretend to be someone that you're not
then their true form comes out !wah! scary [ah]

ya like typing it out like okay so #miza# (um) said she and #aqil# colon
[oh] right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
[orh] yesterday (um) we saw #aqil# [ah] class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend [oh] my god the girlfriend <malay>cantik gila</malay> [sia] I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like (uh) ya <malay>melayu</malay> but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like <malay>macam</malay> like I say hi [ah] but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then #aqil# was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
then [ah]
[ah] ya the the they were in the lot and then like #aqil# saw them then #aqil# was like [eh] and then he park near near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like (err) Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
because right babe when we <malay>duduk</malay> in the car #aqil# need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
!huh!
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
I am not complaining [ah] cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I <malay>tak</malay> complain [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>pun nak</malay> aircon the <malay>kereta dia</malay> anyway so up to you [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> on aircon I okay [jer] you <malay>nak</malay> waste <malay>nak</malay> waste gas
<malay>nanti</malay>
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
but I think one thing that I need to like (um) get used to is <malay>dia punya cemburu</malay>
<malay>cemburu</malay>
like his jealousy
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person <malay>dia cakap dia tak</malay> jealous <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>cakap pasal</malay> like my guy friends or like #shah# #shah# [sia] #shah# is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I <malay>tak</malay> jealous <malay>pasal</malay> like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
#firdaus# is an idiot
like to me it's like (uh) old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that [one] I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dengan dorang</malay> you <malay>dah lama dah dengan dorang</malay>
ya
so like the fact that you and <malay>dorang tak</malay> together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything [lah] between you
you know
we got seven more minutes
I <malay>punya</malay> timer five three two eight
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce #aqil# to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
[orh] <malay>pasal</malay> #aqil# <malay>tak</malay> practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard [ah] to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like !oof! damn cause he <malay>dulu tak pernah puasa</malay> then he say for the last two years he's been <malay>puasa</malay> full [lah]
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like [oh] my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like #aqil# like morals also questionable
like he [ah] he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
especially practising muslim so <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] but <malay>macam</malay> I have friends who like drink but then they go <malay>solat jumaat</malay>
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like <malay>dia dia punya</malay>
<malay>pendirian</malay> [ah] like <malay>dia rasa</malay> like it's okay for him to do it because <malay>dia tak</malay> practise he's not a practising muslim <malay>tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia</malay> practise practise religion then <malay>itu salah</malay> so like I don't wanna ya so like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay like that's your view too
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
<malay>gasak kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> you you <malay>dah besar</malay> you <malay>tahu apa salah apa betul apa</malay> so I <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nak buat apa</malay>
not my responsible to <malay>tegur</malay> you because you <malay>dah tahu</malay> all this you <malay>dah tahu</malay> and like <malay>siapa</malay> I <malay>nak tegur</malay> you know
ya
so I think part <malay>yang dia</malay> like in terms of I'm just scared <malay>macam</malay> my parents <malay>ada</malay> high expectations on #aqil# like they
they <malay>nak ni nak tu</malay> then they will they will I scared they feel like #aqil# is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I <malay>yang nak kahwin</malay> [pe]
ya
right
I think my my parents <malay>punya</malay> fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life [lah] like once <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>meninggal</malay> like you know that kind of thing
(mm)
<malay>macam tak</malay> sincere [jer]
your mum
ya
[eh] how's your mum is she okay
(err) I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
(uh)
most likely early next year
or mid next year
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our <malay>macam</malay> we will start planning [lah] like properly <malay>macam</malay>
apply for house then like (um) because #aqil# just started working so his is <malay>tak banyak</malay>
but I told him [ah] like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like [oh] no [lah] but like he wants to
then I say it's fine (um) like we can like plan [lah] like
I feel like I feel like #aqil# is very very reasonable <malay>dan dia punya</malay> like
<malay>dia tak macam kata dia kata dia</malay> [tau] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>dia dia</malay> will <malay>dengar cakap orang</malay> then after that he will like process and then he would
try to understand and see other people's view [ah] like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with
<malay>macam</malay> be with
like as a partner <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia faham</malay> like the what is understanding in malay babe
<malay>pecah</malay>

it's nice [leh]
later I'll ask them
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [oh] wait
so (um) <malay>kau tahu</malay> <malay>aku</malay> [kan]
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either <malay>kau buka</malay> computer then like
Zoom <malay>semua kau akan berbual</malay> with your <malay>cikgu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi aku punya</malay> [kan] it's like we talk
no we don't talk like we do assignments so we just have like a few questions like less than five
it's like damn fun because it's like
(um) that one whole week right they don't give like
one assignment
on one day it's like
one assignment like five question like monday until wednesday then that's your deadline wednesday night
so one of our question [eh] sometimes cause
okay our [kan] like intern intern [kan]
so like rarely they know
like about us
so one of their question that they ask
was what [ah]
if you can be any kind of colours what will you be
so what is your answer
ya
why
(mm)
can it's up to you but why
white stands for purity okay then
for your inner soul
<malay>apa</malay> inner soul <malay>kau</malay>
(mm) ya maybe [ah] a bit of both
okay you <malay>kau</malay> guess <malay>apa aku</malay> choose
why blue do I look like a blue
no [oh] my god okay correct answer but <malay>aku</malay> chose orange
okay cause orange [kan] is like more of sunset it's like most of the basic [eh] the main colour of sunset is orange
ya so I just chose orange [lah] at first I don't know but then
<malay>aku cakap</malay> like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange [kan] so <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] like (um)
<malay>aku</malay> chose orange <malay>sebab</malay> it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me [ah] <malay>macam dia</malay> can make my soul like very calming
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay [ah] then end up <malay>aku dapat</malay> five points
ya
serious
I think whoever work like
on air right stewardess
they enjoy like they can see all those sunset and sunrise [sia]
ya
yup true
I want to be stewardess but then end end up <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> so like cannot
actually can
fly emirates
<malay>kawan aku</malay> [eh] no #huda's# sister <malay>yashira dia</malay>
ya <malay>tapi dia sudah</malay> quit <malay>sudah</malay>
she [oh] cause <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> like <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> air stewardess
then she said like go [ah] like try but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like
cause I'm using <malay>hijab</malay> [what] so it's hard
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after <malay>bila</malay> touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know <malay>macam</malay>
you know like you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>pelik</malay> like ya but I really want [sia]
ya that's why <malay>tapi macam</malay>
the thing is [kan] <malay>kalau kau</malay> [eh]
<malay>kalau kau</malay> on the way <malay>kerja</malay> that means <malay>kau tak pakai tudung</malay>
so I think <malay>kalau kau sudah</malay> fly #bangkok# or something then
<malay>bila kau sudah sampai</malay> hotel <malay>kau nak keluar balik</malay> then <malay>kau pakai tudung</malay>
so <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kau punya kawan macam</malay>
they say like [eh] just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume [what] [eh] you use <malay>tudung</malay> you know
it's damn crazy
ya
I don't think I can
like I would rather
have like okay not flexible work but
I don't like that kind of
like <malay>macam</malay> back to back
schedule
my body like need rest
ya
but <malay>kau pergi</malay> #bangkok# <malay>bila</malay>
(mm) <malay>aku</malay>
I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
for temperature screener <malay>dia dekat</malay> #bukit batok# hospital
so <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital <malay>tapi tak ada</malay> aircon
[kan] <malay>pelik dia cakap</malay> like note [kan] <malay>dia cakap</malay> below like for the note they said (um)
<malay>tak ada</malay> aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
so <malay>pada aku macam</malay> hospital <malay>apa tak akan tak ada</malay> aircon
no [ah] but
I never apply <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>nampak sahaja</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[lah] aircon <malay>tak ada biar</malay> like I don't want like I want I need
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan [lah] at least
that time [kan] <malay>aku dapat</malay> okay someone I got
okay not <malay>dapat</malay> like they replied to me
so <malay>aku tanya</malay> like hi is this work still available
then [kan] end up <malay>orang itu cakap</malay> ya okay still have available
<malay>tapi</malay> the thing [eh] it's so annoying like <malay>dia orang cakap ada</malay> available
then <malay>dia orang suruh aku</malay> send resume but then they don't reply to it
so <malay>aku pergi</malay> double text like okay I was being annoying <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>aku</malay> need a job
and <malay>dia orang sudah cakap aku</malay> it's available so <malay>aku cakap</malay>
(um) hi excuse me like so is the job still available <malay>aku</malay> double text [tau]
then after that
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> hi yes (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> hi yes sorry like still have
then <malay>dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja</malay>
(um) <malay>dekat</malay> heat <malay>tak sebab dia macam</malay> open space
so the the open space <malay>macam kot</malay> you know the security guard guard post
okay so
<malay>aku sudah aku cakap</malay> okay ya sure like whatever [lah] I just need the money
then end up <malay>orang itu cakap</malay>
(um) okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
so <malay>sudah aku sudah cakap</malay> yes I'm okay <malay>tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya</malay> like

so <malay>aku cakap</malay> (mm)
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post [what]
so obviously there's fan
so <malay>aku rasa dia</malay> annoyed <malay>macam bila aku macam tanya</malay> like <malay>kalau ada</malay> aircon <malay>ke ada</malay> fan then <malay>dia tak</malay> reply <malay>aku</malay> [sia]
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon [eh]
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan [what]
<malay>tak akan</malay> whoever <malay>kerja sana macam</malay> just <malay>mati</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> heat <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>

technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
then after that <malay>aisha cakap</malay> [ah] like (um) like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that <malay>betul</malay> [pe] like story <malay>itu</malay> is #zeko's# story <malay>tapi apasal kau pergi bilang</malay> mama

like
<malay>dia tak tanya aku</malay> permission <malay>untuk pakai kasut itu</malay> like out of nowhere <malay>aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak</malay>
then after that <malay>aku</malay> text <malay>dia aku cakap</malay> one more time if I see my shoes like this
I will throw your nike inside the water
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> nike [kan] she's very protective of it
so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's <malay>mahal</malay>
then after that (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> I was airing it [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay>
<malay>dia pergi bilang kat</malay> sarah <malay>dia cakap</malay> why #mariam# so rude then <malay>pada aku macam</malay> it's basic [what] it's <malay>kasut</malay> birthday <malay>aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay> after <malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> (err) okay [lah] so from now
(err) you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
the least you can say is sorry [what] like at least <malay>aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap</malay> sarah like
(um) <malay>aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta</malay> permission like bag <malay>dia kenapa macam aku sudah</malay> make it <malay>aku sudah minta kau</malay> permission it's just that <malay>kau macam tak</malay> acknowledge it you know
then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ah] whatever [lah] then (err) <malay>dia cakap dengan</malay> sarah I want to buy shoes so like
(err) #mariam# don't have to like nag then <malay>aku macam</malay> I won't nag if you don't
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
then out of no where suddenly the next day <malay>dia pakai</malay> then <malay>ada kotor lagi</malay> like do you know how pissed I was like
<malay>aku baru cuci</malay> like <malay>sudah bersih habis</malay> like <malay>kau pergi pakai</malay>
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use [lah] but then end up <malay>kau nak pakai aku punya</malay> <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku boleh beli habis pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>beli</malay> like you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so annoying like
(err)
annoying <malay>satu kali itu yang</malay> like these few days like we've been like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) how to say [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
!huh!
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
ya like <malay>macam</malay> these past few days [ah] like me and #aisha# we have like this tension then sarah <malay>satu kali</malay>
(oo) I sense tension then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ha] [lah] <malay>kau</malay> just stop
cause
I I won't say it's okay [ah] but
I don't know [lah] I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay [lor] but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm <malay>nanti balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia akan cakap aku</malay> (err) <malay>pergi buka beg sekolah aku</malay> cause that time I use her bag
confirm [one] then
but then <malay>aku</malay> still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
she won't ask permission for her <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur</malay> so like <malay>aku sudah tanya sudah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> what what common sense is that like I don't get it
no
<malay>aku penat</malay> [sia] rant <malay>pasal dia</malay>
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and #aisha# our shoe size is not that
far [lah] it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just <malay>terjauh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>aku pakai kasut</malay>
(um) merry [eh] <malay>kasut apa tu</malay> doctor mart
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak boleh</malay> fit <malay>aku boleh</malay> fit but it's so <malay>ketat</malay> like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause <malay>aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok</malay> [tau] <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> just
like comfortable
ya <malay>tapi</malay> sarah <malay>punya</malay> is not my size so <malay>bila aku pakai</malay> it's like extra <malay>ketat</malay> and like pain
but then <malay>kalau aku</malay> lose the <malay>macam</malay> the strap <malay>dekat belakang</malay> [kan] then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my <malay>kaki</malay> will <malay>ternaik</malay>
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
<malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>malas nak</malay> go through [ah] the blister blister
<malay>aku punya kasut yang</malay> doctor mart <malay>yang</malay> high cut <malay>dulu itu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi dia</malay> #swee# #swee# [jer] [seh]
[a'ah] <malay>macam</malay> since
<malay>dulu bila aku pakai</malay> like okay <malay>dia macam</malay>
#swee# #swee# <malay>tapi</malay> like there's a little bit of space <malay>tapi sekarang sudah</malay> #swee# #swee# so like
<malay>aku</malay> cannot use thick socks I have to use like
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use [lah] but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak nak</malay> like <malay>kaki aku</malay> blister
like no thanks later will ruin all the fun because I will complain about my blister and all
<malay>berapa banyak</malay> doc mart [ah] <malay>kau ada</malay>
ya
one okay I saw two of it what's the another one
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay okay
[ah] but you rarely use that now
no you can just use it anywhere like go lot
hillion
don't lie sometimes your simple is like <malay>aku pakai lepak</malay> then end up <malay>macam</malay> dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
<malay>macam</malay> rare occasion
<malay>aku pun</malay>
okay now
I just need to find high waisted white
[oh] if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower <malay>baju</malay>
the ones that you always use the high waisted <malay>yang</malay> flair
<malay>yang macam</malay> boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
white white
you have right
ya I think that one can match my <malay>baju</malay> because
okay I have to bring that <malay>baju</malay> to you <malay>sebab dia kat bawah (um) <malay>tali</malay> [tau]
so <malay>kalau aku pakai</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau aku pakai</malay> like normal jeans <malay>kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik</malay>
that's why I need something that is like secured to

<malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] !wow! I I can't imagine like myself being rich

but then like <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> you grow up being rich
like you grow up with like a mansion like you don't have to worry about anything
it's so it's so fun
okay <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [eh] what's one topic right
<malay>kau</malay> don't want to talk about
like <malay>macam</malay> sarah right and her <malay>kawan</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> one topic her <malay>kawan macam</malay> don't like to talk about is like <malay>macam</malay> sex
ya but then <malay>aku tengah terfikir</malay> like <malay>kawan aku</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku aqilah</malay> [kan]
she don't like to talk about money
ya <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku tanya aku</malay> [oh] bank <malay>engkau berapa</malay> like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [oh] nine dollar
<malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so flow and easy <malay>tapi</malay> for <malay>aqilah macam kira dia macam berapa</malay> [sia] bank <malay>engkau</malay> like we want check like
cause <malay>kita semua tak nak keluarkan duit</malay> then for #aqilah# [kan] <malay>kita semua diri dekat tepi dia</malay> then <malay>dia pergi</malay> cover [tau] <malay>dia punya</malay> account
<malay>dia punya</malay> that screen then <malay>kita macam berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada</malay> then <malay>aqilah cakap tak ada</malay> [lah] like nothing like not much
cause but I think confirm a lot cause she work as bond
like after her poly then she will work like this company [ah] then they will pay her eight hundred
eight hundred every month like ever since she started her bond so <malay>macam</malay> I think two years already her bond like
<malay>sudah</malay> ongoing
so <malay>macam</malay> confirm a lot then <malay>lagi</malay> her parents <malay>bagi dia</malay> like <malay>duit</malay> allowance
then ya that's one thing [ah] that I realized for #aqilah# she don't like talk about money
but then for my like #syara# and #shak#
<malay>itu aku tak</malay> sure
[oh] <malay>aku rasa shak tak suka berbual pasal</malay>

ya [lah] not not my not my luck [lah]
ya
ya
it's getting worse [lah] in europe area

<malay>kahwin ke</malay>
ya
ya (err) looking forward to it [lah] in the future
[ah] won't be anytime soon [lah] ya maybe after I get a full time job
after after graduating [lah] from the university
I almost there [lah] I feel that already ya
ya [oh] ya then [ah] how's your your dad's [ah] youtube channel <malay>ada masa</malay> upload upload videos <malay>tak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[orh]
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's I think five months
so you expect the baby to appear at [eh] appear [eh] they expect for the baby to be born [lah] in (err) <malay>dalam</malay> late november <malay>begitu</malay>
so
ya all of us are pretty excited [lah] <malay>kita</malay> even <malay>macam dah buat</malay> a baby shower (um) [eh] not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone <malay>punya</malay> spirits [lah] given ya this <malay>macam</malay> hard
time right
ya and I and my <malay>kakak</malay> #wen# is the
<malay>anak pertama</malay> [lah] to carry a child for the family
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
so ya my my mother and my (uh) brother-in-law <malay>punya</malay> mother both of them plan out [lah] the this party for us
so <malay>harap harap</malay> (err) it's going to be fun (err) it's gonna happen I think [ah] early next month also
near #sharmin's# birthday I think
ya her mother will <malay>masak makanan</malay> for us and then after that my mum will plan out <malay>dia punya</malay> games and
(err) <malay>aktiviti-aktiviti</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita akan buat</malay> on that day itself
nah who who who I mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
the government <malay>punya pantang larang</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti ikut</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> respect respectable [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
<malay>malu</malay> [lah]
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
because she can still (err) go to work [lah] but her <malay>macam orang atas</malay> don't want her to come
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
because he works at the port right so he helps (err) he is a I think I think he's an engineer then <malay>dia tolong macam pasang</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> equipment <malay>yang rosak</malay>
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he <malay>macam gembira</malay> [ah] like !wow! finally he get a job [ah]
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
(err) [ah] school (err) <malay>apa tu yuran</malay> ya <malay>yuran sekolah</malay> unlike us [lah] for for
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) I think really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level [seh] ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five [ah]
(mm)
my sorry what
[oh] my girlfriend [ah] [oh] she's she's fine [lah] because [ah] she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it [lah] how [ah] it's very interesting
then <malay>dia orang tayangkan</malay> the whole thing on (err) facebook live
so they will (err) how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
so they will be like [oh] [ah] school of engineering <malay>dekat bawah</malay> [jer] <malay>nama-nama dia punya</malay> students ya in that slow
ya ya in that type of (uh)
effect ya format ya
[ah] facebook facebook live
then (uh) she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her (uh) school of (uh)
mathematics
(err) they had a zoom
so in that zoom session <malay>dia orang ada buat macam</malay> lucky draw [lah] so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods (err) jabra elite mostly <malay>macam</malay> those school technology gadgets [lah]
ya <malay>dia lagi sikit menang</malay> [seh] she said (err) she said (err) the one that wins ya it's usually like either <malay>dua ke atas dua ke bawah</malay> so
what they found out from her name [ah]
ya
I mean [ah] aren't we all sore losers some days [ah]
[oh] (uh) it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
[ah] she went out [lah] with her family cause (err)
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
I actually ordered (err) ice cream <malay>untuk dia</malay> so like
ya then <malay>kat rumah</malay> I think got no one so (uh) ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure [lah] cause the number is
[ah] the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her [lah] but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that <malay>dia balik sebelum</malay>
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
so <malay>mana tahu</malay> [ah] got <malay>nasib</malay> [ah] time <malay>tujuh</malay> then <malay>baru hantar</malay>
I can request [lah] I mean the idea of contactless [kan] but
(uh) I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible [lah] because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so (uh)
what to do
ya recently (err) one of your I think last year is it one of your friends graduated also right
there are what what do you got got for her

ya
old fella [lah]
(mm)
I mean you know how how [ah]
ya how emotional the fan can get so I mean he put his heart and soul to this club

ya
he wanna pursue psychology or
sociology in that that sense [lah]
ya but ya
(mm) days were with him were the best [lah] because like you know me right I served
my as a firefighter ya and <malay>kita dulu masuk</malay> the station together together
so like both of us (um) kind of like spend our time there together [lah] from the start
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy [ah] <malay>kat</malay> #yishun# <malay>situ</malay>
the <malay>daerah</malay> canberra
so ya like when we were still freshies on the fire ground it was a bit scary [lah] because we don't know what to expect
meanwhile they told us in training is <malay>lain</malay> what from what you are going experience real life
ya but honestly the he is a really good good buddy [lah] to have when it comes to firefighting
ya
ya I'm I'm sure you have the same
experience when you what serving your time as the police right
what what what what you doing [ah] in police
[oh] [oh] so so you so you were like <malay>macam</malay> patrolman [lah] <malay>gitu ronda-ronda</malay> around the area
[ah]
the (err)
okay
[oh]
ya [lah]
!wah! they are not worrying [ah] like you I mean do you get calls often or <malay>macam takde masalah ke</malay> in the area
[oh] (err) I mean like since you are posted in a the area <malay>macam tak ramai orang</malay> [kan] so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
(um)
[oh]
understand [lah]
understand understand
ya I had I had a lot of fun in yes
<malay>macam tak</malay> pressure [lah] <malay>orang tak</malay> I don't feel <malay>macam orang</malay> bully you or anything
ya
[ah] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>hibur-hiburkan</malay> [lah] so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
you know that it was just the that's a wrong day [lah] wrong time
(mm)
ya true true
ya well how you spend the rest of your day man
[oh] <malay>lari-lari anak</malay> around area
[ah]

[oh]
ya correct [lah] I mean there's quite the huge distance [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> the only only time I ran <malay>jauh gitu</malay> is back when I was in serving my [lah] they make us run around #ubin#
(mm)
ya correct [lah] true true
[ah]

(uh) <malay>habis</malay>
thirty minutes <malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>minum</malay> that that's the ideology that
I don't know [lah] but that's what I see [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya
I see [ah] is is you want it you want to drink just to quest [eh] quench your thirst but not to

making your performance worse than if you
control your drinking [lah]
which is true [lah] ya cause they also mentioned that actually heatstroke [eh] no sorry not heatstroke on the heatstroke I think [ah] ya heatstroke ya heatstroke it's not because you don't drink too much

you know what I mean
ya
well it's only been a a few months [ah] since the start of the year
[ah]
ya [lah] as of now just chill [lah] just ya
occasional stuff
ya don't want to get my head too high
in the clouds
ya
(mm)
ya later you know my
potential <malay>nak kena</malay> backfire [ah] you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it <malay>macam</malay> tame first
ya
before it gets ya
ya pretty I pretty sure I already told
a handful of people only
[ah] including you
ya that's the thing
see
ya I've been wanting to
have this conversation quite awhile [lah]
I thought we could have played games you know during this (err) holiday period like like how he used to [lah] but
ya I guess this busy schedule
right I mean
furthermore <malay>kalau main</malay> also like
how many hours
and we don't have that kind of time [ah]

(err)
can I do it I actually don't mind [lah] even though I'm not close to loofy
[ah]
I would I wouldn't mind [lah] ya I mean
as a natural bass player I
I think I can handle
the the responsibilities of a lead guitarist [ah]
ya shouldn't be a problem [lah] but when is this [ah]
(um)
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] [ah] I know [ah]
ya that time [lor]
[oh] <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>baik</malay> [tau]
[oh]
(mm)
he quit or <malay>kena buang</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] but ya I heard back then <malay>dia punya</malay> temper also quite
quite serious [ah] he was your classmate [kan]
(mm) true true true
[oh]
(mm)
I see I see
but <malay>kalau</malay> I think
I should be down to jam with you all [lah] <malay>kalau jumaat lepas solat</malay>
probably four [oh]
together
[eh] but
I heard
if you want to go together then <malay>kena</malay> apply online [kan] to get the queue
[oh]
so should I apply like
like how long how much in advance can I apply now now can already [leh]
[orh]
[oh]
<malay>dia orang</malay> fast game [ah] [dah] apply online
ya but how's the slots like though
the best seats is <malay>tingkat berapa</malay>
[oh]
cause closer to god [kan]
(mm) so that means the the
<malay>takde yang rapatkan saf</malay> [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
I heard
the <malay>wuduk</malay> area now they <malay>dia orang taruh apa</malay> sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay okay [oh] so they they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means <malay>salam pun tak boleh</malay> [ah]
[ah] okay okay
the gentle gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
I mean
ya
<malay>orang</malay> only the <malay>orang atas</malay> would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one <malay>pun</malay> mostly <malay>kat</malay> my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old <malay>kedai kopi</malay> and (err) you know the mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast <malay>punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng</malay>
ya
ya
ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya I did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that <malay>macam dah</malay> second nature [kan] <malay>ambil wuduk</malay>
(um)
ya I mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] <malay>cik jamal</malay> [oh] I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest <malay>punya</malay> supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya (mm) I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just just stress [ah] bro for the last last two games [ah]
cause you <malay>punya</malay> opponent (mm)
ya correct correct
mid table but <malay>kalau menang</malay> the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa europa
ya champions league [dah]
<malay>dah tak boleh dah</malay>
a bit out of reach [ah] ya <malay>jauh sangat</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] so that's that [lah]
quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya that is expected of them [lah]
ya so
<malay>tu yang</malay> quite disappointing [ah]
but (uh) you know you know football just football [lah]
it just a game so
(mm)
ya
correct correct this [ah] can't be predicted [lah]
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
(um) win [ah] so <malay>syabas</malay> to them
yes
(mm)
true true true
ya
[oh] ya speaking of liverpool right so how is (uh) your good our good friend [ah] #havi#
ya
[oh]
[oh] the usual springleaf or the #prata# place [ah]
(mm)
ya that's true that's true
!wah! so you'll be meeting him later [ah]
[oh] !wow!
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my [ah] regards [ah]
(err) like him to know that
I'm always happy for him [lah]
cause this is like first time in
<malay>dua puluh tahun</malay> is it ya liverpool won <malay>punya</malay> premier league
[ah] ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
(uh) that's amazing
ya now he already ya [sia] he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time [ah]
[ah]
but I will have to say [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> though he quite <malay>semangat</malay> [ah]
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be <malay>melampau</malay> [ah]
how emotion emotional football gets [ah]
(mm)
ya true true
but [oh] wells
is he is he still the regular <malay>kat</malay> your fire station
[oh] so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it [ah] the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme [oh] the
something to do with like mature mature student or something [eh]
[oh] james cook (mm)
[ah] okay okay
he but his passion nice [lah]
under him [mah]
(mm)
(mm)
trainings
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a <malay>budak baik</malay> [lah]
and (uh)
<malay>polis</malay>
ya
ya I was at (err) I was at the and #ang mo kio# over there ya
ya correct correct
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya as me
ya so a bit <malay>sedih</malay> [ah]
cause they cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I <malay>kena</malay> posted <malay>kat</malay> foxtrot division [ah] <malay>tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat</malay> this area [ah]
sorry sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] I would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like <malay>macam</malay> woodlands #jurong#
ya I would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I I feel the same way [ah] as as much as like you know the <malay>berita dia orang</malay> cover and all these cases of
<malay>macam</malay> mismanagement
ya
I think it's isolated <malay>punya</malay> cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm)
true true
ya
cause <malay>biasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] I would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish (err)
I wish I have plans after this [ah] but sadly I don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
I usually go for a minimum ten [ah]
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
[kan] <malay>kena</malay> stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya but I think is <malay>tak susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] but it's
<malay>kena biasakan</malay> so
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you when you first start [lah] like after one ten and then usually you <malay>togok air</malay> like <malay>melampau</malay> [ah] but
now I barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree [ah] [kan] I mean cause <malay>banyak orang banyak orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak begitu</malay> informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay>
the
it is the right way [lah] is to <malay>jangan minum banyak</malay> [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like <malay>macam</malay>
it's it's it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
<malay>kena</malay> full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you you <malay>minum melampau</malay> [ah] basically
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause <malay>kalau kau minum banyak</malay> [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
<malay>kau punya badan</malay> is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you <malay>biasakan</malay> with more water then the more likely you will
<malay>kenakan</malay> the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
<malay>ni semua kena belajar</malay> [ah]
(mm) <malay>yang tepat</malay> [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but I've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you as you saying
(uh) I would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>biji</malay> [ah] <malay>biji</malay>
<malay>biji-biji kecil</malay> [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
I think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the <malay>biji</malay> take out then you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> but but then
<malay>bila kau minum</malay> [kan]
then is the texture smooth
<malay>kalau</malay>
[oh] do you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> [ah]
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya I would say that [lah]
ya
but <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>kau kena</malay> like see first [lah] whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before <malay>kau tambah</malay> extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend
[ah]
(mm) true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
with the sugar level already <malay>dah cukup</malay> already
<malay>tak payah tambah</malay> extra stuff
(um)
but as for
(err) grapefruit
(uh) those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit [ah]
ya
so be smooth [ah]
sorry grape
[ah] <malay>lain</malay>
ya different different
(err) grapefruit is <malay>besar sikit</malay>
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
<malay>sama sama</malay> ya
ya it's (uh) <malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
<malay>nama sama tapi</malay>
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut [ah]
(mm)
ya but <malay>kau kena potong</malay> [ah] before you put <malay>dalam</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> blender
