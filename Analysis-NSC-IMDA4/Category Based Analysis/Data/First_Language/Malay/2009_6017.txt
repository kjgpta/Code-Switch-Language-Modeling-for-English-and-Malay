(err) you have a lot of fun [lah] especially with like your co-workers
but the the thing about challenger is different people works for different shift so
you you meet new people [lah] every time you work

[ah] ya <malay>hal ehwal masing-masing</malay> [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
I mean I don't really make a lot of friends in school I mean because of the university [ah] environment [lah] like you know people come from different backgrounds and we have different timetables so

true
ya [lah] not not my not my luck [lah]
ya
ya
it's getting worse [lah] in europe area
and ya and (err) on the bright side also <malay>nasib baik</malay> [lah] cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to <malay>beli rumah ke</malay>
<malay>kahwin ke</malay>
ya
ya (err) looking forward to it [lah] in the future
[ah] won't be anytime soon [lah] ya maybe after I get a full time job
after after graduating [lah] from the university
I almost there [lah] I feel that already ya
ya [oh] ya then [ah] how's your your dad's [ah] youtube channel <malay>ada masa</malay> upload upload videos <malay>tak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[orh]
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's I think five months
so you expect the baby to appear at [eh] appear [eh] they expect for the baby to be born [lah] in (err) <malay>dalam</malay> late november <malay>begitu</malay>
so
ya all of us are pretty excited [lah] <malay>kita</malay> even <malay>macam dah buat</malay> a baby shower (um) [eh] not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone <malay>punya</malay> spirits [lah] given ya this <malay>macam</malay> hard
time right
ya and I and my <malay>kakak</malay> #wen# is the
<malay>anak pertama</malay> [lah] to carry a child for the family
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
so ya my my mother and my (uh) brother-in-law <malay>punya</malay> mother both of them plan out [lah] the this party for us
so <malay>harap harap</malay> (err) it's going to be fun (err) it's gonna happen I think [ah] early next month also
near #sharmin's# birthday I think
ya her mother will <malay>masak makanan</malay> for us and then after that my mum will plan out <malay>dia punya</malay> games and
(err) <malay>aktiviti-aktiviti</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita akan buat</malay> on that day itself
nah who who who I mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
the government <malay>punya pantang larang</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti ikut</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> respect respectable [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
<malay>malu</malay> [lah]
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
because she can still (err) go to work [lah] but her <malay>macam orang atas</malay> don't want her to come
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
because he works at the port right so he helps (err) he is a I think I think he's an engineer then <malay>dia tolong macam pasang</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> equipment <malay>yang rosak</malay>
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he <malay>macam gembira</malay> [ah] like !wow! finally he get a job [ah]
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
(err) [ah] school (err) <malay>apa tu yuran</malay> ya <malay>yuran sekolah</malay> unlike us [lah] for for
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) I think really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level [seh] ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five [ah]
(mm)
my sorry what
[oh] my girlfriend [ah] [oh] she's she's fine [lah] because [ah] she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it [lah] how [ah] it's very interesting
then <malay>dia orang tayangkan</malay> the whole thing on (err) facebook live
so they will (err) how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
so they will be like [oh] [ah] school of engineering <malay>dekat bawah</malay> [jer] <malay>nama-nama dia punya</malay> students ya in that slow
ya ya in that type of (uh)
effect ya format ya
[ah] facebook facebook live
then (uh) she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her (uh) school of (uh)
mathematics
(err) they had a zoom
so in that zoom session <malay>dia orang ada buat macam</malay> lucky draw [lah] so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods (err) jabra elite mostly <malay>macam</malay> those school technology gadgets [lah]
ya <malay>dia lagi sikit menang</malay> [seh] she said (err) she said (err) the one that wins ya it's usually like either <malay>dua ke atas dua ke bawah</malay> so
what they found out from her name [ah]
ya
I mean [ah] aren't we all sore losers some days [ah]
[oh] (uh) it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
[ah] she went out [lah] with her family cause (err)
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
I actually ordered (err) ice cream <malay>untuk dia</malay> so like
ya then <malay>kat rumah</malay> I think got no one so (uh) ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure [lah] cause the number is
[ah] the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her [lah] but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that <malay>dia balik sebelum</malay>
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
so <malay>mana tahu</malay> [ah] got <malay>nasib</malay> [ah] time <malay>tujuh</malay> then <malay>baru hantar</malay>
I can request [lah] I mean the idea of contactless [kan] but
(uh) I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible [lah] because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so (uh)
what to do
ya recently (err) one of your I think last year is it one of your friends graduated also right
there are what what do you got got for her
ya ya that close friend you met on (err) ya #juliana#
[oh]

he quit [lah] I mean ya it they kind of <malay>buang</malay> him [lah] he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets <malay>dia punya orang baik sebenarnya</malay>
