(um)
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] [ah] I know [ah]

probably four [oh]
together
[eh] but
I heard
if you want to go together then <malay>kena</malay> apply online [kan] to get the queue
[oh]
so should I apply like
like how long how much in advance can I apply now now can already [leh]
[orh]
[oh]
<malay>dia orang</malay> fast game [ah] [dah] apply online
ya but how's the slots like though
the best seats is <malay>tingkat berapa</malay>
[oh]
cause closer to god [kan]
(mm) so that means the the
<malay>takde yang rapatkan saf</malay> [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
I heard
the <malay>wuduk</malay> area now they <malay>dia orang taruh apa</malay> sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay okay [oh] so they they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means <malay>salam pun tak boleh</malay> [ah]
[ah] okay okay
the gentle gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
I mean
ya
<malay>orang</malay> only the <malay>orang atas</malay> would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one <malay>pun</malay> mostly <malay>kat</malay> my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old <malay>kedai kopi</malay> and (err) you know the mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast <malay>punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng</malay>
ya
ya
ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya I did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that <malay>macam dah</malay> second nature [kan] <malay>ambil wuduk</malay>
(um)
ya I mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] <malay>cik jamal</malay> [oh] I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest <malay>punya</malay> supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya (mm) I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just just stress [ah] bro for the last last two games [ah]
cause you <malay>punya</malay> opponent (mm)
ya correct correct
mid table but <malay>kalau menang</malay> the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa europa
ya champions league [dah]
<malay>dah tak boleh dah</malay>
a bit out of reach [ah] ya <malay>jauh sangat</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] so that's that [lah]
quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya that is expected of them [lah]
ya so
<malay>tu yang</malay> quite disappointing [ah]
but (uh) you know you know football just football [lah]
it just a game so
(mm)
ya
correct correct this [ah] can't be predicted [lah]
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
(um) win [ah] so <malay>syabas</malay> to them
yes
(mm)
true true true
ya
[oh] ya speaking of liverpool right so how is (uh) your good our good friend [ah] #havi#
ya
[oh]
[oh] the usual springleaf or the #prata# place [ah]
(mm)
ya that's true that's true
!wah! so you'll be meeting him later [ah]
[oh] !wow!
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my [ah] regards [ah]
(err) like him to know that
I'm always happy for him [lah]
cause this is like first time in
<malay>dua puluh tahun</malay> is it ya liverpool won <malay>punya</malay> premier league
[ah] ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
(uh) that's amazing
ya now he already ya [sia] he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time [ah]
[ah]
but I will have to say [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> though he quite <malay>semangat</malay> [ah]
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be <malay>melampau</malay> [ah]
how emotion emotional football gets [ah]
(mm)
ya true true
but [oh] wells
is he is he still the regular <malay>kat</malay> your fire station
[oh] so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it [ah] the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme [oh] the
something to do with like mature mature student or something [eh]
[oh] james cook (mm)
[ah] okay okay
he but his passion nice [lah]
under him [mah]
(mm)
(mm)
trainings
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a <malay>budak baik</malay> [lah]
and (uh)
<malay>polis</malay>
ya
ya I was at (err) I was at the and #ang mo kio# over there ya
ya correct correct
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya as me
ya so a bit <malay>sedih</malay> [ah]
cause they cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I <malay>kena</malay> posted <malay>kat</malay> foxtrot division [ah] <malay>tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat</malay> this area [ah]
sorry sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] I would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like <malay>macam</malay> woodlands #jurong#
ya I would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I I feel the same way [ah] as as much as like you know the <malay>berita dia orang</malay> cover and all these cases of
<malay>macam</malay> mismanagement
ya
I think it's isolated <malay>punya</malay> cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm)
true true
ya
cause <malay>biasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] I would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish (err)
I wish I have plans after this [ah] but sadly I don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
I usually go for a minimum ten [ah]
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
[kan] <malay>kena</malay> stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya but I think is <malay>tak susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] but it's
<malay>kena biasakan</malay> so
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you when you first start [lah] like after one ten and then usually you <malay>togok air</malay> like <malay>melampau</malay> [ah] but
now I barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree [ah] [kan] I mean cause <malay>banyak orang banyak orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak begitu</malay> informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay>
the
it is the right way [lah] is to <malay>jangan minum banyak</malay> [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like <malay>macam</malay>
it's it's it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
<malay>kena</malay> full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you you <malay>minum melampau</malay> [ah] basically
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause <malay>kalau kau minum banyak</malay> [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
<malay>kau punya badan</malay> is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you <malay>biasakan</malay> with more water then the more likely you will
<malay>kenakan</malay> the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
<malay>ni semua kena belajar</malay> [ah]
(mm) <malay>yang tepat</malay> [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but I've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you as you saying
(uh) I would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>biji</malay> [ah] <malay>biji</malay>
<malay>biji-biji kecil</malay> [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
I think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the <malay>biji</malay> take out then you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> but but then
<malay>bila kau minum</malay> [kan]
then is the texture smooth
<malay>kalau</malay>
[oh] do you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> [ah]
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya I would say that [lah]
ya
but <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>kau kena</malay> like see first [lah] whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before <malay>kau tambah</malay> extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend
[ah]
(mm) true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
with the sugar level already <malay>dah cukup</malay> already
<malay>tak payah tambah</malay> extra stuff
(um)
but as for
(err) grapefruit
(uh) those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit [ah]
ya
so be smooth [ah]
sorry grape
[ah] <malay>lain</malay>
ya different different
(err) grapefruit is <malay>besar sikit</malay>
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
<malay>sama sama</malay> ya
ya it's (uh) <malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
<malay>nama sama tapi</malay>
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut [ah]
(mm)
ya but <malay>kau kena potong</malay> [ah] before you put <malay>dalam</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> blender
