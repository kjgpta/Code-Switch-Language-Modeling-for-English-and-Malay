ah chey chey kau berbual merepek sia
oh okay um sekarang I'm doing like part time um kerja part time so macam um I do some um actually doing financial advisory um ya at the same time doing um freelance freelance works ah ya um macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
ah no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had um indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
uh ya ya ya so actually um like last time my maid selalu um talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam I know how ya how to speak ya hmm
um actually it just baru baru start so macam um macam just had like briefing then uh so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
ya I think macam health actually quite important lah um ya I rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy lah for your good for your health and stuff like that
same lah sama sama ya is is I think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja oh so baru graduate also
oh drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
oh macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing lah
hmm so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between lah
mm dia mm okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common lah untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
mm actually good good that your boss macam I recognize that you you need to take a break then um then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me uh ya lah macam I work for dua tahun then lepas tu uh I tried dua company tapi macam uh at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau I need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to macam take a break and then um from there I explored different different punya industry and then um at the same time I kerja part time then um macam trying to at the same time I explore lah whether I feel nak stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough lah one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya at least some more now macam it's COVID punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
it's something better than macam nothing right
ya ya ya I think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam jer then um ada assignment then um some project ya just learning new things I guess
oh the the webinar is actually uh era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya tapi those hmm tu actually untuk mid career adults lah macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new lah I guess ya
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
hmm okay I see I see I see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
hmm sounds very challenging lah macam susah so
ya so macam I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment lah so I started taking um um I started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings um to to prepare us lah macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to um basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody lah so so I rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn macam susah to macam convince people um to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process lah I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
hmm I macam baru start meeting clients that um uh there are some um potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that ah ya
so um other than that macam I think you what you said about um an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive um like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess tapi macam I haven't actually um had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then um for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy macam ya like I don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how I felt lah everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
ya I think it's common like macam I spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing lah ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job kan
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like oh is it difficult
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay um so um ya it's really macam it's I think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
oh you are twenty only oh sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me lah like because ya even though I'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy lah our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think ah macam syukur lah like I feel quite
mm I see ya I think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
you ada connections with like theatre punya um like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
um actually macam I just told him I am exploring something new lah while because like at the same time also um learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so macam I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything lah like I can pay for my own things like I ada savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that lah like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like ada ada like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
ya I think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace lah it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar hmm
hmm oh you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time um I rasa like while we're still young important to save also lah saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since I was young kan I always believe in saving then macam I am quite thrifty lah macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like I made sure to to have enough savings lah so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
oh but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun lah like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right hmm
ya tapi you can just tell her later kan like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
tapi ada notice period tu semua lah
oh kenapa
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
okay actually I ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience lah then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least macam lah like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry lah then at least you roll one out
so actually I met her from um like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
I don't know I think macam I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like I was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand lah like my work was difficult lah like I was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
at the same time macam as in like I said lah because I had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important lah like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing lah ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing lah like take a break and not work kind of thing
oh probation ah macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
no but your contract said you have so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
oh only one kakak lah
huh sorry oh see I see okay ya I'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common lah
so um I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that hmm that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
dah diam lah okay

err just walk around and then dia kata
come on guys let's do it gitu aku macam tak it's it's more of like an australian accent

the other time kat mannequin mannequin so taking each other
entah agaknya ah aku takut gila sia
oh tabik salute
tak apa it's okay good things await for those who
so my school starts actually for now it's like um tengah holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october nineteen tu pun now is just only like semester one jer belum semester two then like it's still like year one so
macam I feel like year one ni lama gila
ya my friends also like nak ajak hang out also my friend you know sarah
she ada club so she sarah and nasrul ni uh both of them is club is school of applied science punya
ah is more like your own course habis is more of like leadership punya kind of
then um tak salah
sarah have like err apa ni event ah for their um for their so she's the one that like macam like overall in charge
so ada ada um ada ada groups yang kena buat event tu one is her group kena pilih another one is another group tapi nashrul punya group like um tak kena chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week baru like we
I also have my own tapi tak apa lagi pasal malas
ya pasal malas
honestly I respect those people yang macam dia orang sudah like for two years
and then doing the same thing that budak poly buat then having to go through the same thing like for another three years kat poly it's just so tiring and exhausting ah that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people yang
selepas they choose to just work
apa ni uh studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
poly kan macam also is like poly so like I feel like macam ni poly example I take it as eh having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
it's not like macam easy you know like for those people who really like um
buat the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
salute those people who macam have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to um poly ya
phase is just um submitting your diploma ranking course lah kalau your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah kan dia dapat interview so dia pass interview and then she already get her what ah her results that like she can go in like like her place for
um pharmaceutical science memang sudah chop chop for her so macam okay lah she sudah selamat she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because dia memang can already it's like
so macam kalau interview sudah pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all lah
but for me because my interview tak dapat
now focus solely on which is uh kita orang pasal kita orang tak ada exam also so they look
over um they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day macam for us kan ada orang like
um sekolah dia orang satu hari is like is combination of subjects but for me is like kalau math is
then after that kalau there's a mixture of A and B is banyak and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like um three to four
gitu then kalau macam C banyak gitu then maybe around two point five to three point five gitu then um
like baru berapa compared to my other two friend I think they did more better lah in a sense
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech memang nak try dapat biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan dia like
dia like mati-mati nak biomedical science jer like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
but the thing he tak put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense lah cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
biology also tak pernah dapat A
A susah nak dapat then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard lah cause it's the um they focus um on biology the most
so like this semester tak ada exam so I next semester ada exam
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay pasal assignment dia pun is
tak banyak like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day kan like through read virtually like other then after that um
habis ada quiz juga that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
then the practice question is like biasa macam homework gitu
mostly banyak presentation but it's good lah
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm um when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages pasal like I think you will feel like
kalau I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu kan is just like my weakness like
then pasal presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then macam
senang lah but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates yang
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation punya tu
sometimes I'm like wow kita dah eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near um uniforms so macam eh how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old lah then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage kan aku macam actually it's normal macam biasa like wow it's just normal lah honestly
and it's okay cause macam tak ada boyfriend kan it's okay lah macam we don't really take that into my mind macam oh like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like keluar dates with you know I think
I don't really mind lah kalau I have a boyfriend or not as long as macam that is like um kawan dekat you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me pasal later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
NAFA is like lah kirakan
like different people also like different lah honestly like um the things that they're prioritising and it's all like semua ada masing-masing lah hanya
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to macam have a lot of worries like oh pasal duit and all that of course you want your family to be macam stable lah like in every um ya in everything you know
it's very hard lah like I feel like kalau family tak cannot like tak tak ada like stability and all that kan I feel like ah one day confirm will fall apart punya
and some more I also like the type of person yang tak message orang
like wow kalau dah malas dia punya malas is malas tak aku boleh like
for one week straight tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa cause like I'm that type of person ah
so macam ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up kan macam wah like heartbreak this heartbreak gila babi you know like that kind
but then like wah like sekarang I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
but even though like there are times macam eh macam nak ada orang like to be by your side like a boyfriend lah okay kirakan like cakap good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
kita boleh get over it lah there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
so like sometimes kalau oh ada family gathering kan it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something ah even my sister like
like uh video call her friends during ah apa ni I'm having a dinner so I I feel like macam like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay lah kalau ada kawan tu okay but then like kalau it's time to like for your family you focus on your family jer tak mahu get mixed lah like video call with friends like
other time you can do what like kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang like jumpa kawan habis kat rumah also like kawan then like when are you going to like you know um
mm spend time with your family not really ya tak ada
wow I'm lucky to be in such a family kind punya vibes cause different family different ah ada family like focus um
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future kalau nak ada family I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then kalau like my anak-anak macam ada boyfriend ke girlfriend ke aku macam nak bagi advice sikit
apa benda you kena buat
I'm going to sign on police agaknya
tak dapat police maybe
macam itu lah
sama lah long time since I've been to
the shoes are cheaper there like macam I like
macam jacket japanese
people never see before so orang tak pernah nampak outside
um when you go to your trip dekat korea
agaknya japan
I I hope satu hari ah I hope so that
anime ada banyak type like what's your genre in anime
aku pun agree
selain anime
tak tahu ah this one is your favourite or not but it is two days one night
oh he's I don't know when is the last time I watched two days one night tak tahu ah bila
I tengok running man jer
my favourite girl group uh tak tahu ah pernah dengar ke tak
kalau aku ingat it is
agaknya that time
kalau uh I
but dekat sini
makanan apa you suka
like asam rebus you know especially when
I also think macam itu juga ah
kalau for me
um selain McDonald's what's your favourite fast food also
yes ya dia dari uh datang dari filipino
I boleh makan like three piece or five piece of chicken
it's just sedap
tempat dia dekat sana juga ah I think we talking about the same thing
and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think
oh I'm sorry my melayu rabak sikit
so tebu is definitely not bamboo
K K I'm K salah saya
I pergi sana is because
so bila I go there ah
dia kerja dekat suria is it
I tak tengok news
kalau free ke apa tengok lesung
sekarang ni I watch bara
aku rasa uh
dah ada dekat uh mobile
uh habis senang untuk kita just you know
you pay one-time fee habis senang untuk
can watch your favourite anime tapi depends ah
sometimes not all the show that you want ada dekat dalam
apa cerita you tengok dekat
yes so kadang-kadang my class start at eight
the latest that I arrive paling lambat I think pukul lapan
tapi I will try my best to come school early next time
cuba juga improve my
now I have a lot of projects so tengah nak habiskan semua
lama seh
I think nak apply kerja
susah lah nak cari duit
err bulan depan
apa-apa you cakap tadi ah
dalam masa depan pun I think will continue my studies
apa you join
tak tak tahu kenapa also I join then when I was sec three
my kawan uh all ajak me go
and that's where I grew my interest dengan rugby
I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily
tapi I hope that phase three is coming soon because tak sabar nak pergi malaysia
tak mahu cakap pasal mask
then when you breathe and there's fog dekat cermin mata
I can't wear contact lens takut
my kawan like
I pun tak sabar nak uh habiskan ini COVID
ya sedih bila dengar Teo Heng is closing down
tapi um if it's not karaoke
I rasa I nak pergi main bola dengan my kawan
oh of course I want to keluar dengan my family
uh ajak dia orang pergi dinner um
you know uh pergi
tak pernah dengar pasal hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher tu boleh buat untuk staycation
dah lama plan
ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind
bila I go wild wild wet
kita pergi wild wild wet but actually it's different because
kena lineup time uh the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people dekat dalam you only can go one round
boleh enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
cannot agaknya bring my girlfriend along
um actually tak pernah pergi sana but I hope to try
like just now bila
I cakap I don't like uh I mean I like heights right
I takut
bila dia tengah naik suddenly dia turun
tapi no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
ada ah similar
tapi tak boleh lah because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and nak cuba
there's satu specific
that I suka
it's a M three uh I tahu you don't like cars but
ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies
kalau you percaya there's nine fast and furious movie
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so macam dah malas nak tengok
ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family
uh yes ada baby pictures of me wearing a
actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup
um I'm not being a hater tapi macam I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
kalau tak nak pergi kerja you can always take tapi kalau dah ambil
uh pergi lah rest dekat rumah
hards hard time has to come first baru
easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy
ya I get what you mean tapi
harap that everything will
and boleh dapat uh boleh dapat kerja senang
kalau boleh everybody at uh live their normal life after that
I hope that good news akan datang
kalau tak we will if orang tak uh
akan datang ah

primary school aku dulu kat katong punya area kan then
then there was macam a lot of
macam drains ada banyak longkang-longkang besar
so that time tengah primary school tengah pendek kecil kan so like
after school nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang then keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya area keluar kat luar jer kan

to work somewhere in uh plaza singapura lah plaza singapura then I can err it's
second they called me they say which ah which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza singapura then
they send my resume to plaza singapura then

like food online or online or macam food delivery online then
bars and all that lah macam whatever that has music ah
actually macam counter that thing yang is actually can survive and
ah ah if you're comparing macam like music eh audio and video right
uh right now video is important lah macam there's more video jobs like for internship like more video jobs err
ya lah so sometimes I feel like macam
would have been different lah but but ya lah macam nasib ah
mm betul itu lah that's why that's why right now
I mean ada macam I I got my school
so actually I feel honestly right now aku feel like macam want to give up lah because
macam there's no more industry there's no no more music industry right then
then I'm like in year three trying to finish my diploma in audio then macam I feel like sometimes
like want to give up lah pasal like like
you know of of course there's still macam online streaming all that lah cuma
you know netflix you know netflix sekarang they have err all the singaporean movies
everything is on the Netflix right now you know then like macam
oh is it oh tak ya ya all the way lah right now right now all the all the old singapore movies is on
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
