[eh] bro long time no see [ah]
not that [ah] actually cause I just got sacked [ah] by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
ya that was back then [lah] but <malay>sekarang dah kena buang</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak ada guna</malay> [ah] <malay>nak tengok tu semua balik</malay>
(err) around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful [lah] cause
I got to travel to different countries [ah]
among all the countries I would say
(uh) saudi arabia cause (uh) it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
so <malay>aku rasa lebih aman</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay>
[ah] saudi arabia [ah] #mecca# <malay>rasanya kat</malay> #mecca# <malay>sana semua</malay>
no <malay>aku</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku tak pasti</malay> [ah] <malay>apa pasal</malay> corruption <malay>ni semua tapi</malay> I did read over the news that (uh) ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself [ah] but then
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion [lah]
(err)
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
(uh) finding [oh] discovering new food there the arabic food was
amazing I would say <malay>sebab dorangnya</malay> taste
a bit different from asian <malay>nya</malay> culture <malay>dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit</malay> [lah] and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I would say I would want to go to
spain [ah] cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
(err) I want to go to #barcelona# cause
I will to get a chance to meet #messi# [ah] you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>disebabkan</malay> COVID period [kan] <malay>aku rasa</malay> no chance [lah] <malay>nak gi sana nak jumpa atau</malay> maybe <malay>kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada</malay> chance <malay>kot</malay>
<malay>maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau</malay> in singapore
so far <malay>aku rasa dorang dah main dah</malay> start <malay>main cuma</malay> it's just that no [ah] spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will [ah] suffer a lot of loss [ah] cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue [lah]
actually <malay>tu yang aku pelik</malay> [ah] but then (uh) I did make a research [ah] on the internet and I found out that (uh) they make money through (uh) fans memberships the merchandises like example (err) <malay>satu apa ni baju bola</malay> [kan] they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe [what] so <malay>kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin</malay> they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover [lah] you know before the
whole (uh) football period (uh) resumes
(uh)
ya <malay>aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat</malay> facebook <malay>apa semua</malay> especially in singapore (err) aviation <malay>macam-macam kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya</malay> (err) <malay>kita tengok</malay> singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial [ah] aids to (um) singaporeans [ah]
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang aku</malay> rest [jer] <malay>kat rumah sebab</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> to stay close [ah] with my family
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective [lah] but I would say it's hard [lah] [ah] you know to find a job that [ah] that is suitable with me <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit</malay> savings <malay>aku</malay> [ah] <malay>alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat</malay> save for the past (err)
months that I've been working as air steward <malay>kalau tak mungkin aku kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>cari mana-mana kerja</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> actually <malay>risau juga cuma</malay>
<malay>alhamdulillah</malay> again <malay>aku dapat</malay> save quite a lot
I mean <malay>aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau</malay> [kan] but then ya I would (err) the savings that I save
probably can last me for six months [ah] if I really (err) spend accordingly and safely [lah] and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
[oh] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku baca hari tu kat</malay> facebook <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa kerja</malay> as a swabber is it they could earn like
four thousand !wah! that I think that's a lot [eh] for a part-time job
maybe cause (err) they are finding people who are willing to work (uh) a risk a risky job [lah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> they are willing to pay that much
<malay>tapi</malay> to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer [lah] <malay>sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi</malay> maybe it's better if government pay them [lah] you know
[oh] I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
(uh) moving forward
it will be a tough period [lah] for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera [lah] you know <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>nak cakap susah memang</malay> [lah] <malay>susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> wonder on how singapore would cope with this (um) COVID nineteen [lah]
(mm)
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs [lah] you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that [lah] cause as we (um) you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
(err) the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
and <malay>tu pasal aku rasa penting</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> plan [lah] <malay>untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada</malay> family <malay>atau beli rumah aku rasa</malay>
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important [ah] in singapore
(uh) ya I get that a lot [lah] I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
(err) it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
(err) you know a lot of children I don't know [lah] maybe for them it's a <malay>rezeki</malay> but in terms of singapore context
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you [lah] but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided (err) you are not doing overtime or what [lah]
so ya two thousand is not enough [lah] at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that (err) or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling [lah] you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and (um) the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them [eh] sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children [lah] you know maybe
for (err)
primary school children [kan] <malay>tak payah bayar</malay> school fees <malay>ke</malay> or maybe edusave <malay>bagi lebih banyak sikit ke</malay> you know
ya I really agree on that [lah] we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know (err)
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right !wah! my house [ah] I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you [lah] to [ah] hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time [eh] you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
(uh) this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news [lah] I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry [lah] to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree [ah] there are multiple aspects that (um) lead to (err) emotional (err) depression
or probably (um)
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right (um) financial
(uh) issues I think is the most depressing issue [lah]
you know cause
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this <malay>aku kadang-kadang pening</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab aku dapat gaji</malay> [jer] <malay>aku kena kasi</malay>
<malay>apa ni adik-adik aku</malay> [eh] sorry <malay>adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar</malay> bill <malay>aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi</malay> [ah] then <malay>aku kadang-kadang</malay> barely <malay>aku cuma ada kadang-kadang</malay> five hundred for myself like in every month
so <malay>walaupun</malay> I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with !wah! sorry with whatever I'm having [lah] you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period [lah] for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
I mean I sometimes I really wonder <malay>macam mana orang-orang yang</malay> (err) <malay>sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak</malay> [lah] you know <malay>rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar</malay> [tau] <malay>dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar</malay> bill
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think [ah] I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very (uh) depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also (err) came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID [lah] I mean some people
(err) actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why [lah] I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything [lah] that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
(um) hold the border
to some (uh) high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news [lah] maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
(uh) explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the (uh) about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
being raped which I'm totally (uh) angry about <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk</malay> singapore <malay>mungkin kalau aku</malay> ironman <malay>mungkin aku akan pergi sana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku nak</malay> save <malay>dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau</malay> (err) <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>sedara kau sendiri</malay>
(uh) was tortured was raped in front of other people
(uh)
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's (err) moral morally right [lah] I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
<malay>tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi</malay>
<malay>ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua</malay> I really
(err) don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say (uh) history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being (uh) killed
(err) you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
(err)
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
ya I really (err) I'm really disappointed that (um) the muslims are treated that way and also another case is <malay>sekarang ni</malay> happening in this world is
(err) I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really (err)
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community [ah] be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it (err) it (err) really (err) bring a hole
(uh) present representation of the whole community and as you can see in [eh] <malay>aku tengok</malay> (err) <malay>kenapa</malay> police <malay>dorang</malay> (err)
<malay>apa</malay> treat all those (uh) black people with such violence and brutality
where recently <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> news (err) <malay>satu orang dorang siapa nama dia</malay> george floyd was killed
intentionally in front of people !wah! that was another level of murder I would say [lah]
(err) <malay>aku tak tahu apa yang tak</malay>
police police <malay>tu fikir</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa</malay> (err) <malay>orang tu dia setakat</malay> (err) <malay>apa ni ada</malay> fake <malay>duit</malay> [jer] which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
(err) we did have I mean we do have (uh) casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it [lah]
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such (uh) racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
<malay>aku rasa dalam negara ni</malay>
(err) <malay>orang masih boleh</malay> you know <malay>kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma</malay>
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others [ah] you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist [lah]
ya I heard that (um)
<malay>dekat sana ada</malay> this thing called <malay>bumiputera</malay> where the malays are given
the malays do have more privilege than (uh) comparing compared to other races [ah] know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a (uh) national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country [lah] you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example [ah]
you and your neighbour
wanted to buy this house at <malay>taman melawati</malay> [lah] you know in #kuala lumpur# or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard [lah] I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean (uh) but then ya that's what I heard [lah] when you are chinese indian
(uh) sarawakian or #sabah# you know someone from #sabah#
you have you don't have that <malay>bumiputera</malay> rights where you can
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
should be <malay>bersyukur</malay> you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually [kan] <malay>kalau dorang gi klinik</malay> they could actually
they (uh) <malay>dorang cuma perlu bayar</malay> one <malay>ringgit</malay> [jer] [tau] one <malay>ringgit</malay> for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
a clinic I don't know you could (err) easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say [ah] but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be (err) it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being [ah] you know
they are they are going to get charged in court [eh] I know you confirm know [ah] who's that guy [ah] #najib# (uh) #najib razak# and some other
his (uh) friends getting charged at court cause
they (err) they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and <malay>kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke</malay> I mean
okay [ah] <malay>berdosa tu dah</malay> another level <malay>dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> [eh] <malay>rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu</malay> and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
<malay>kapal apa</malay> yacht [eh] I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something !wah! that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister [lah] like that you know what you think about that
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years [ah] but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and <malay>mesti dia akan dapat</malay> lawyer <malay>yang bagus-bagus</malay> [ah] and he might win the case and just (uh) go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years [ah] so
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way (uh) you know they
they (uh) give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny [lah] but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
is a joke you know is a joke you know <malay>kau kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> (uh) how how well
[ah] our ministers in singapore is acting and how (uh) well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very (uh)
I would say [ah] I don't know what to say [ah] it's very good [lah] I would say what you think about that
actually actually <malay>memang ada tapi</malay> (err)
(uh) he he's called the <malay>yang berhormat</malay> speaker you know he's the man in the centre that (uh) will call on each (uh) each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
(uh) ministry like for example financial or et cetera [lah] and but then
I really (err) you know in <malay>melayu</malay> [ah] they say <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say [eh] speaker <malay>diam</malay> [lah] [eh] speaker <malay>apa ini</malay> you know they are very chaotic you know and
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke [lah] I mean have you watch the singapore [one]
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister #shanmugam# and mister what it's called [ah] mister #vivian balakrishnan# the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
bro (uh) I don't find it weird [ah] cause <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau]
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
all of the ministers actually <malay>ada</malay> fake degree you know he actually <malay>beli</malay>
<malay>di apa</malay> a fake degree on internet or something or <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia suruh orang</malay>
<malay>pergi ambil</malay> degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something [lah] I mean <malay>memalukan</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
I mean <malay>kau dah tak</malay>
<malay>kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus</malay> and
you being a minister you will only (err) how to say (uh) not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do [lah] you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with (uh) in a higher position right they seem (uh) they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it [lah] so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most [ah] I repeat again most ministers
are recruited (uh) based on merit [lah] you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya <malay>aku aku</malay> happy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> government <malay>yang</malay> stable [ah] <malay>walaupun ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ramai kata apa</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> minister <malay>ni tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>minister tu tak bagus tapi</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> <malay>kita nya</malay> government quite stable [lah] and <malay>aku</malay> happy to see that ya
[eh] actually <malay>aku terima soalan ni banyak gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak duduk</malay> malaysia the reason being is that
[ah] the peace and financial freedom <malay>mungkin sebab masa tu</malay> I mean still (uh) <malay>sampai sekarang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku masih kerja kat</malay> singapore [kan] and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted (uh) into the malaysian currency it's time <malay>apa</malay> times three <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>satu dolar tiga ringgit</malay> and you when you go there <malay>kau boleh</malay> spend <malay>apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa</malay> spa <malay>apa bagai</malay> and <malay>kau boleh buat apa-apa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana</malay>
and <malay>kau kerja kat sana</malay> [eh] you might not be (uh) spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia <malay>ringgit</malay> example you are earning two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in malaysia
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
!huh! so you willing to wake up in the
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and <malay>kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik</malay> bus <malay>atau naik</malay> motor <malay>pergi kerja sini</malay> and okay [lah] <malay>mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam</malay> twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
<malay>sebab</malay> ya the you know the okay example <malay>kau bangun pukul empat pagi</malay> then <malay>kau kerja sampai lima pagi</malay> and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and <malay>kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam</malay>
and you know <malay>kau</malay> barely have time for yourself [ah] you know <malay>kau rasa kau akan</malay> do that for a long term or
(um)
(uh) maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
you know try to spend two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand <malay>ringgit</malay> I mean
of course [ah] it's not easy for them I mean <malay>aku pun ada sedara kat</malay> malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in [ah] you know <malay>dalam kampung-kampung semua</malay> and (um) <malay>kalau kat</malay> singapore <malay>apa orang kata</malay> is it or gross income [lah] <malay>dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit</malay>
<malay>atau seribu lima ratus ringgit</malay> and
it's still <malay>tak cukup</malay> you know cause they are living in a <malay>dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang</malay> I mean <malay>mungkin barang-barang murah tapi</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>barang-barang lain macam</malay> bill <malay>makanan apa semua</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay> and still <malay>tak cukup untuk dorang</malay> so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles [ah] so we cannot justify on what they are facing [ah] but [kan] in singapore itself it's very hard you know
(err) like I said [lah] having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
(uh) ya I mean I do agree [lah] on what you are what you just speak you know but (uh)
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past (uh) thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
(err) no I I don't
I mean I might sound
(err) like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships [lah]
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is <malay>haram</malay>
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong [ah]
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said [lah] I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore [lah] you know <malay>penting gila</malay> I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to <malay>tolong</malay> you to to (uh) you know to give <malay>duit</malay> I mean
it's embarrassing [ah] I mean this is not some gender inequality [lah] but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that (um) ya actually women [ah] do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
(uh) have to lead them [lah] I mean I mean this topic is very (err) subjective [lah] you know but I think in singapore women are really (um) having a good career earning more than man I would say
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains [ah] birth rate in singapore is declining [kan] <malay>orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab</malay>
ya <malay>dorang risau</malay> [kan] <malay>apa tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada tak cukup duit</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> time and
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada</malay> maid <malay>aku tak akan ambil</malay> maid <malay>untuk jaga anak aku sebab</malay>
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know <malay>besar</malay> I want to <malay>saya aku nak besar</malay> [kan] <malay>anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan</malay>
<malay>setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap</malay> they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them <malay>kasih sayang</malay> [lah] <malay>kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau</malay> you know <malay>dibesarkan dijaga oleh</malay> maid and maybe one day <malay>dorang tak kenal kau atau</malay> maybe <malay>dorang sayang</malay> maid <malay>lebih dari kau</malay>
(um)
<malay>gitu</malay> [lah] I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important [lah] singapore [kan] <malay>kalau kau</malay>
<malay>kau kau bayang</malay> [kan] <malay>kau</malay> spend
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding [ah]
I mean actually
it's not even compulsory <malay>pun</malay> to have your own wedding
so <malay>yang penting</malay> I mean in our religion islam <malay>kita nikah dah cukup</malay>
<malay>tak penting pun</malay> then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend <malay>dekat kau punya rumah kau</malay> can pay <malay>lebih</malay> deposit
and stuff and (um)
