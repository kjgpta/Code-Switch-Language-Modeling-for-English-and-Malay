and this is #wafaidil#
pretty good you know and it's (uh) it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family (uh) spending I just spend today at the beach in #sentosa# and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study (err) this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you #hady# what have you done for this weekend
(um) personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant [lah] I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless [ah]
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill [lah] looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
(um) one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand [ah] for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
(um) in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us [ah] cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it [ah] it's always (err) prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like [ah] fighting off against the heat [ah] and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
<malay>minumlah banyak air</malay>
so <malay>bila kita dah peluh</malay>
[ah] more water is put in ourselves and we will <malay>kita akan rasa</malay> hydrated [lah]
okay my
(um) me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid [lah] and
me as being someone very (err)
very (err)
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free [ah] cause I didn't ask to be born with (err) bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on [ah] for you know countries like switzerland providing [eh] countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their (um) their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also (err) adopt that (err) value of (err) taking care of their people's health [lah]
and providing certain free services for like I would say certain be better cause
(err) we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question #hady# (um)
it may be seem out of context but (um) if you could have one superpower what would it be
(mm) after much consideration of like
[ah] me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think [ah] do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind [lah] through through their eyes [lah] basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard [eh] hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark [ah] and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
(err) back to you #hady#
[ah] and you can also read the minds of all the <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> what they are talking about between each other
you can just listen from afar right
(hmm)
ya yes of course you know (err)
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to (err) give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind [lah] cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya [lah]
<malay>nanti tak baik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau orang tengok kita macam</malay> (err) <malay>orang jahat tapi padahal kita biasa-biasa</malay> [jer]
[ah]
(hmm) <malay>kalau aku</malay> I feel that
I <malay>aku akan belajar</malay> (err) what what's that photo photo memory
where you see something once
<malay>abeh terus boleh ingat</malay>
(um) this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be (hmm) I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking [ah] cause
(err) food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
(err) ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me [lah] to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my [ah]
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
(err) I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
(err)
I'm (err) I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household (err) and (um)
somewhat lacking in the social department [lah] cause
(err) it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
(err)
we just (uh) interested in different things [lah]
so that's just me and my (err) life relations [lah]
(err) <malay>masing-masing ada masalah sendiri</malay> [kan]
you know
for as for you #hady# <malay>kalau kau boleh</malay> master <malay>tiga benda</malay>
master <malay>apa</malay>
(hmm) me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated [lah] cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single [ah] intricate detail of like
explosions (um) (err) hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
(um) if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables [ah] cause
(err)
nearly all my favourite actors [ah] actors and actresses are in there my idol
<malay>abang sado</malay> arnold schwarzenegger
(err) there's also
(err) people like
(err) rocky [ah]
(um) not really him but (err) the actor for rocky [ah] <malay>yang dia naik tangga tinggi itu</malay>
[ah] he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie [ah]
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance [ah]
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
(um) diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
[ah] the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions [lah] of
in a love [lah]
(hmm) <malay>kalau aku</malay> [eh] <malay>nak jadi</malay> actor
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush [ah]
mister johnny depp he has a very (err) mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie [ah] I would say
(err) but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his (err) former wife [eh] [ah] by amber heard
it's kind of sad [lah] I just wish him the best [ah]
you
(hmm) so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps (oo) because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar [ah] I relate to (um) my johnny depp cause you know
well
<malay>kita dua-dua</malay> handsome you know and can relate
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters [ah] [eh] small horses [ah]
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea [ah]
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school [ah]
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea [ah] and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and [ah] another item I would say is probably
(hmm)
probably a note to myself from the past (err) you know [lah]
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know [lah] like what's your future self
would I be more <malay>gemuk</malay>
would I be <malay>lagi tinggi</malay> would I be (err) <malay>lagi kaya</malay>
(err) you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing [ah] basically a reality check from the past [ah]
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
my young self could persuade <malay>bapa</malay>
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more [lah] cause
<malay>lagi kaya</malay> [lah]
[ah] as for you #hady# what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste [ah] putting a note together
take [ah]
you want me [ah] one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes [ah]
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars [ah] people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me [ah]
I could sponsor my parents trips to their <malay>haji</malay> every single year
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
(um) like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
[ah] I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time [ah]
of course (err)
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
(err) ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert [lah]
(um) me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes [ah] and
(uh) I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things [ah] that
I would wish for [ah]
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you #hady#
what would you wish for
(um) those are very good wishes [ah] your first wish makes me (err) seems like a very stingy person and selfish [ah] cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself [ah]
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that [ah] cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone [ah] so if you could
I would suggest you (err) be the owner of liverpool instead [ah]
fair enough [ah]
[oh] that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat #nasi lemak#
cause
(uh) actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
actually <malay>kalau aku boleh makan satu satu benda untuk</malay>
the remainder of my life [ah]
probably #nasi ayam penyet# [ah]
it literally has all components I need [ah]
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
[ah] there's always cucumber which is good
(err) of course [lah] the primary part [ah]
of course [lah] the
(um) primary part
of the dish of #nasi ayam penyet# which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
and always a small kick of spice with the <malay>sambal belacan</malay> that is always given so ya I would say that's a pretty
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body [ah]
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so #hady# if you could eat one dish what will you eat
(hmm)
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
(um) <malay>kalau aku</malay> [kan]
I would want to be a
(err) I would want to run my own radio like (um)
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to [lah] cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to (um)
(err) prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch [ah] they very humorous
and
considering they are three <malay>abang melayu</malay>
that [ah] that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
[ah] started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
!wow!
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
<malay>aku</malay> guarantee you we would be a number one radio
(um) another job that I would be
probably the law law sector [ah]
<malay>daripada kecil</malay> I've
<malay>aku nak jadi macam</malay> lawyer <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know <malay>tolong orang</malay> [ah]
(err)
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment [ah]
for example <malay>kalau orang dia jahat</malay>
that give him the proper (um)
punishment
I don't want I don't want to be a lawyer <malay>macam</malay>
they can be bought off [ah]
(err) you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense [ah]
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
<malay>gini semua merepek</malay> [ah]
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize [lah]
justice [ah] over anything
and for my third job [ah]
honestly I would want something social [lah]
so perhaps
(err)
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know [lah] cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
(err) (err) a hobby of mine which I like [ah] cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently [ah] so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly [lah] if the people #macam#
<malay>kalau orang itu perangai jahat</malay>
you can learn
how to deal
<malay>dengan orang yang perangai tak baik</malay> in the future
<malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
back to you #hady#
<malay>kalau aku</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
for me personally
from what I've seen [ah]
I feel like <malay>badan sapau</malay>
<malay>lagi penting daripada kelihatan</malay>
[eh]
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body [ah] cause
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
<malay>semua perempuan melayu</malay>
you know
(um)
(um)
good looks over that one [ah]
cause they also keep in mind that they want
<malay>dia orang nak</malay> baby <malay>yang macam</malay> you know <malay>yang</malay> cute cute
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them [ah] easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
[ah] <malay>itulah yang</malay>
from what I ask my female friends [lah] female <malay>melayu</malay> friends
that's what they say [ah] how about you #hady# what you think
<malay>setuju</malay> [ah] <malay>setuju</malay>
there there's no point if you have good looks
<malay>tapi perangai macam</malay>
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah] simply said [ah] for what for what he looks good
but <malay>dia kurang ajar dengan kau dia tak jaga hati kau</malay> what's the point of all these if cannot that's why ya ya personally
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality (oo) then that's what I would choose [lah] primarily ya stick to good looks [lah]
okay (err) passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
(um) personally <malay>aku setuju dengan</malay> your opinion that <malay>hidup kita semua</malay> (err) is moving in a very fast pace [ah] and you all happening
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it [ah] so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind [ah] (um) kind [ah] does a heavy toll on us [ah]
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
(err) mental health <malay>ini memang</malay> overlooked at [ah]
they just avoided [ah] like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
ya that's what they always thought but [ah] in this newer generation is good <malay>yang</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita semakin</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (err) making it more of a
(err) raising awareness [lah] I would say (err) to this type of issue [ah] back to you #hady#
[oh]
(hmm) ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya (err) okay time to turn (err) time to turn to happier pastures [ah] from this depressing (err) fix (err)
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
(um)
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport [lah]
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of (err) electrical buses
very green [ah]
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide (err) you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country
and ya something that I'm proud of being singaporean is I think an effective and also green public transport
yes of course #hady# we talked about certain questions and
getting our opinions on certain issues I feel like this talk was very good [ah] productive <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
<malay>terima kasih</malay> bye bye
