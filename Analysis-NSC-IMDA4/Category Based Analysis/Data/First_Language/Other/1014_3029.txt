or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K [lah] I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
<malay>satu ke tepi abeh macam</malay> lazy eye and then the
the distance between each eyes is like right
why do you care about his perspective when you're the one who has to look at him so <malay>mata dia jauh gila</malay>
<malay>abeh hidung dia macam butang</malay>

<malay>kita</malay> poke <malay>nama</malay> [sia]
okay (err)
(mm)
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
(err)
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay [lah] one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
!huh!
!huh!
<malay>tak faham</malay>
so <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> tour guide
I don't understand
<malay>ada ke kerja macam gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm) I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no [lah] in singapore first [lah]
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya [lah] what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and (uh) basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya [lah] with the money then I will do that [lah]
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills [what] and then the cats I rescue them and then [what] feed them [what]
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya [lah]
cause I will invest also [what] so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
<malay>tak itu</malay> those like kittens and <malay>semua</malay> is like
a non-profit organisation
!huh!
(uh) (uh) I cannot [lah]
volunteer [ah]
then you get to play with the cats [sia] so cute
bring [lah]
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya [sia] like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
[eh] then nevermind [lah] they can be bubbles and more [what]
why socks
no but it doesn't fit
the kind of names that you want
blossom
what do you mean brighter cat
[oh] you mean have what white cat
orange or ya
but even if they are
bright cats you can't even see them
ya why why do you want to see them in the dark anyways
why you want to know what they are doing
[oh] ya just now while eating
I was telling #aliyah# I dreamt about

not like as if I practise all of this [what]
but ya of course I will help myself
because that's the most important thing right now
if somebody wants to <malay>jampi</malay> another marriage or something then just tell [lah] why do you need to use <malay>jampi</malay> [sia]

(mm)
odd weeks you mean what alternate weeks [ah] basically
[eh] why are we talking about this
[eh] but I have always had this like
(err)
thinking
!wah! I I've never believe in all these nonsense [sia] until like
like she told me about the possibility of the
the family using all of these but to me this is all <malay>merepek</malay> and like <malay>syirik</malay>
ya but I I really don't believe until like it it's like closer to me now !alamak! mama <malay>balik pula</malay>
okay (err)
okay nevermind let's switch topic first since like
we cannot talk about it now
(um)
(mm)
but what
[oh] ya I wanted to say
I feel like
papa has sense like
<malay>macam pelindung</malay> for like all of us
!huh! your friend can see
what kind of places
no
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>kena kacau macam mana</malay> at the place
<malay>hantu tu takut dengan kau</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
you saw
then
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
!huh! <malay>kau punya</malay> like yours
and then
and that's why I thought I said that
I somehow feel like papa send like <malay>pelindung</malay> for us
cause his family also like
<malay>macam orang-orang boyan</malay> and then after that come from the indonesia also [what]
his side
if I'm not wrong
ya [lah]
why do you think <malay>nenek</malay> and <malay>atuk</malay> keep saying that (uh) <malay>mesti bapa kau pakai benda untuk mak kau</malay> and everything which I find like <malay>macam merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau percaya benda merepek ni semua</malay> but
when I as I grow up and then I try to understand all these different cultural practices then I'm like ya
we cannot be like so dismissive
when there is a possibility of it
(mm)
ya you'll never know [sia]
and he's not that like great also
and then the wife like <malay>macam tunduk dekat dia</malay>
no but I really think that he did send something for us since he like cannot be around us
and then this <malay>pelindung</malay> is fighting with #etol's# thing so that's why I still can think rationally like no I don't want this marriage but that thing also is like playing around and say no you want this marriage
I think
I think
I think
I think these are all signs of
delusion
I think <malay>kita pergi</malay> <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>abeh ustaz ustaz ni ustaz ustaz ni semua berapa</malay> [ah] <malay>kena bayar islam punya</malay>
no we cannot get like normal <malay>ustaz</malay> [what] we need to get like the

if we have <malay>pelindung</malay> we no need to be scared [what]
<malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>ni pelindung</malay> if only I can talk to my <malay>pelindung</malay> please do your job you didn't really save me from
making some decisions that I will regret
[ah] then after that he will <malay>jampi</malay> even stronger <malay>jampi</malay> [lah]
