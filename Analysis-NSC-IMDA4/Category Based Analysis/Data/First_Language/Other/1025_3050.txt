you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know <malay>pada kau</malay> because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like [oh] <malay>dia macam</malay> it's their first time seeing it [ah] so they will either like it or not like it [ah] so if it if they like it means it's good [lah]
ya and like

dengue my friend had dengue but he was hospitalised and then he's okay already you know mine was my friend was like I think two weeks then like okay aleady
fever and dengue <malay>dia rabak</malay> [eh] chronic [eh] but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct [oh] okay so only one presentation [ah] <malay>bagus</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku dua</malay> presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself <malay>macam tiga</malay> lecturer <malay>yang kita ada</malay>
and then like (uh) week sixteen is another lecture that we <malay>tak kenal</malay> ya so it's like (uh) brand new face that see <malay>macam</malay> because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer <malay>kita</malay> [kan] everyday <malay>nampak</malay> [kan] so like they bring this another lecturer then from there <malay>terus</malay> but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like (err) that one I can say (uh) make or break [ah]
ya but the adjunct lecturers <malay>semua baik gila</malay> ya
but depends [ah]
is it I I don't know what that that lecturer is called
[pe] processor ya <malay>entah</malay> [lah] that what name ya
I feel like this sem my lecturers are quite good
cause last sem really it's <malay>rabak</malay> [eh] and I feel ya <malay>entah</malay> maybe because <malay>pasal</malay> like
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] I feel like last year was their year <malay>macam shu dengan</malay> like eden I feel like this year it's like me and <malay>effy punya</malay> ya their they are so <malay>rabak</malay> !oi! [ah] ya last term last term
(mm) honestly <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay>
!huh!
same year (uh huh) year one sem two
it was a bad year year two sem one this sem mine is good
(mmhmm) [orh] it's your own major right ya ya <malay>kita</malay> every sem <malay>tukar kelas</malay> ya but fuck
cause
because like honestly I thought this sem <malay>kita akan tukar kelas lagi</malay> but then me and <malay>effy macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>kita geram gila</malay> [ah]
you know we still in the same class <malay>tapi macam</malay> okay how it goes right that
<malay>sama</malay> class so everyone in <malay>sama</malay> class [ah] so basically its like monday tuesday is <malay>kita punya satu</malay> module [jer] <malay>kita ada</malay> for this sem for next coming sem [ah] <malay>satu</malay> module [jer] but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
<malay>kirakan</malay> major [ah] like what we want
<malay>macam</malay> we have <malay>macam</malay> performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot [ah] performing arts then we have
<malay>apa tu</malay> packaging motion design <malay>semua</malay> then we can only choose three <malay>aku ambil</malay>
ya ya part of my module cause is like cross elective
okay [what] <malay>macam aku ambil</malay> figure drawing is the same [what] but it's still under fine arts [what]
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of <malay>apa tu</malay> routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then (uh) from that three then <malay>kita belajar</malay> then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem <malay>aku tak dapat ambil dua yang</malay> figure drawing full [kan]
ya so <malay>aku</malay> just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya !huh! [oh] my god <malay>aku</malay> four [jer] [eh] (mmhmm)
[oh] ya ya but packaging [ah] the <malay>aku dengan effy</malay> took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what [oh] design and brand strategy because honestly (uh) <malay>kalau kita ada tiga ni benda</malay> [kan] then intern <malay>kita</malay> will be easier though ya because like for us <malay>macam apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) whatever we take is to prepare us for the future
ya and honestly <malay>aku tak sabar untuk</malay> intern I don't know why
what is that have [lah] choose your ya correct correct [oh] for you guys [lah] okay (uh huh) [oh] !wow! [eh] that's good [eh] [eh] that's good
girl you know how we have to get for our intern we have to choose six from like example intern
fastjobs ya exactly then we (uh) these ten slots [kan] we put inside this then that (uh) for the [kan] we have to send to our lecturer which is like our lecturer [lah] for the whole three years then (uh) she will be chooosing he or she will be choosing for us our intern ya he or she feel that which one is better for us
right exactly that's why I feel like yours is better [oh] okay
cause like I feel like <malay>kita boleh pilih</malay> but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> our lecturer will be the one that ya but (uh) honestly after that after this coming semester [kan] <malay>kita ada</malay> three months holiday right then me and #effy# thought of like <malay>kerja</malay> at any (uh) graphic comm <malay>punya</malay> firm and then from there <malay>kalau</malay> like we feel that in in <malay>apa tu</malay> that company is quite good then we just continue until intern [lah]
ya so it's like a smart move right
no it's in year three babe ya [lah] so continue [ah]
<malay>dah ada kerja</malay> what you mean okay (uh huh)
<malay>kerja</malay> for that really [meh] no [lah] I don't think so <malay>tu</malay> <malay>ni</malay> diploma
[eh] you okay or not
no [lah] I feel like during okay [lah] I feel
the process it will take place in that sem [lah] week sixteen twenty blah blah blah ya
the process then <malay>kau</malay> will first day <malay>macam</malay> for example first day <malay>kau</malay> is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya [lah] so <malay>apa yang kau nak</malay> start <malay>dalam</malay> year two sem two ya [lah] the process is year two sem two [lah] ya [lah] okay so that's what I should've say girl
but honestly right I feel yours is better [ah] but it's nerve wrecking also [lah] ya true
(hmm) <malay>entah</malay> [eh] I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
pros is like at least you get to talk
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [ah]
like the companies that choose you you can choose yourself you know
then
then after that like (uh) <malay>tak</malay> the cons is like you have to compete with everybody [ah]
and a bit like <malay>macam</malay>
in your face [tau] <malay>macam</malay> company <malay>tu tak nak kau macam</malay> !ouch! <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> indeed <malay>aku nampak banyak macam</malay> art teacher <malay>abeh</malay> those <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
that C word I forget what is that for the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>budak-budak</malay> art
<malay>bukan</malay> taxi [lah] !aduh!
[oh] my god I forget but then it's like something
got conductor not it's not conductor [ah] ya curator
I mean like your course quite broad [lah] honestly and yesterday also <malay>aku cari macam kedai-kedai</malay> [eh] <malay>kedai</malay> [eh] company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to <malay>kerja</malay> as part time [eh] stop it
ya so stop !hais! [eh] <malay>kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang</malay> picking packer okay [lah] this whole week <malay>kau</malay> take a break then maybe <malay>kita</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> next week [ah]
ya
<malay>kalau bukan</malay> this week <malay>kau nak</malay> confirm <malay>dengan aku bila</malay> okay okay okay
!hais! no cause <malay>aku</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> [kan]
!huh! no it's actually quite okay but the thing is I I don't know [leh] I I feel like
what I sign up for it's not what I get
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail <malay>punya</malay> position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but <malay>macam kirakan</malay> there's a lot of <malay>macam</malay> promoter at each section so you are doing that <malay>kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga</malay> overall then <malay>kau kena tengok-tengok</malay> and at the same time you have to like go for the customer <malay>ni semua</malay> [lah]
that's the
point you know [oh] my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so <malay>aku</malay> it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store <malay>kau kena</malay> take care of ya so exactly that's why <malay>aku terus</malay> like
<malay>aku dah tak aku dah</malay> quit I told #shah# about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like [oh] you can just go to the customer then I'm like [oh] okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
so what am I supposed to do I just stand there walk around [lah]
I think six hours nine eleven to six [eh] I just whatsapp the manager [ah] say like the environment is not for me (uh) what (uh) this is honestly not what I expected it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya <malay>kalau tak esok aku kerja esok</malay> thursday <malay>aku</malay> actually [dah] full this this week

the funny part is
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they (uh) then end up <malay>orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah</malay> exactly so I'm like exactly then (uh) #effy# is quite mad ya
<malay>effy dia</malay> #sot# [lah] <malay>tak aku</malay> example it's like really unfair [ah] I don't know why but it's just the school [lah] I can say
you show <malay>macam orang punya kerja</malay> it's like a good thing [lah] but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
<malay>apa tu</malay> copy yours and do better and after that
<malay>dia orang punya kerja yang kena pilih</malay>
and you are still <malay>kat bawah</malay> trying to survive <malay>padahal kau punya</malay> it's like <malay>orang yang</malay> copy
ya I think there's that [ah]
[eh] <malay>kau suka pergi</malay> hiking <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak aku macam nak pergi</malay> hiking
<malay>aku dah lama mana tak pergi</malay> hiking <malay>abeh</malay> one time <malay>aku kat</malay> <malay>abeh macam mana</malay>
every friday saturday sunday
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
not every [ah] ya can say ya <malay>macam</malay> friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo [ah] so every time <malay>dia nak patah balik patah balik</malay> sunday ya
sunday
I don't know though honestly it's going better cause at that time [ah] we actually went downhill [lah]
<malay>aku tak bilang siapa-siapa</malay> ya it's like I don't know [ah] at times we <malay>gaduh</malay> and then like but that one time we <malay>gaduh</malay> right quite <malay>rabak</malay> ya but (uh) the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it <malay>macam</malay> you know if we break it off then what's the point of us <malay>macam</malay> wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct (mm) the thing I like about him right <malay>dia punya</malay> mindset is really mature !oi! he's your age ya
then like I don't know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>dia cakap</malay> like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>dah tak suka</malay> I <malay>semua ke apa</malay> in our relationship anytime [tau] <malay>kalau aku</malay> just <malay>dah tak ada</malay> feelings but just <malay>bilang dia</malay> and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go [lah] <malay>kalau tak macam</malay> if he wants to make it work [lah] ya so it's like very matured thing [ah] at the same time <malay>kalau kita nak</malay> break it off
we have to really <malay>macam</malay> talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
and then like now it's getting better I don't know I feel like ya
I think that one week before he went we really fight a lot
ya really a lot until we I think he (um) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] I call [kan] <malay>dia tak angkat</malay>
at that point <malay>macam betul-betul</malay> like he like we had enough of each other [lah]
but then <malay>macam</malay> (um) during the period the first few weeks <malay>terus macam makin lama makin</malay> okay then now it's better [ah]
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right <malay>dengan</malay> my school schedule then like we met almost everyday [sia] then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
we keep fighting then now ya then now we it's good [lah] cause we got our own space and we can focus more ya
and we don't fight a lot also and like you miss that person a lot to fight so ya I don't feel it better [ah]
and like <malay>pejam celik pejam celik aku</malay> next month [dah] one year <malay>dengan dia dok</malay>
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya <malay>tu masih suka</malay> [eh] <malay>aku masih</malay> (uh) <malay>kerja kat</malay> [seh] <malay>baru baru</malay> [oh] my gosh then now <malay>dah nak</malay> one year it's quite fast [eh] really really fast
