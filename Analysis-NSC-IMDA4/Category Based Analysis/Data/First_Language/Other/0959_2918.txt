ya they say is like
it's like won't be as what you experience
before like it won't be back to pre-COVID life [lah] definitely

damn hard to breathe [sia] sometimes
especially on hot days
(hmm)
<malay>rimas</malay> ya

what to do is like that [lor]
[oh] you want to go

!wah! then that yesterday I also talked with adrian
about like you know adrian is in
[oh] (err) TransCom adrian [lah]
he also went for shooting the other day
ya then he says he's damn busy now
(hmm) <malay>belum</malay> my [one] supposed to be

so they say okay never mind can come another time then like [oh] okay [ah] then they I think they reschedule me for
january [ah] january eight ya
next try will be next try will be when [ah] early of [eh]
eleventh of jan I think
[ah] [oh] damn
okay [lah] hopefully [lah] cause
I just want to get it over and done with [ah] they say is just like <malay>satu hari</malay> [kan] so should be okay if not like I have to go this [one]
the the one that they actually ask me to go now right is like
<malay>berapa hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>dua hari</malay> [ah] so one day then <malay>lagi satu hari</malay> the actual shoot [ah]
ya but I don't know why they ask me okay (err) thursday you come for then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
[oh]
maybe [ah]
[orh]
I mean that would make sense [lah] is earlier
[ah]
been awhile since I go there also [sia]
[eh] no [lah] last time I went was for
!wah! that [one] #shaggy#
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it (err) you so (um) one week
push-up all that right the person is
(err) standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count [lor]
but then (err) cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
(err)
there's no gauge for you when to
(uh) push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier [lah] but then
ya [sia] true
you got try at #maju# [ah]
[ah] #maju# the
#maju# is very the the machine
damn cock like <malay>susah untuk</malay>
use [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the what [ah] the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run [eh] the
the
(uh) statics because is all automatic
then I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> [kan] so
<malay>macam</malay> new experience [ah] then
(err) when I use then I !wah!
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like !wah! I never run this fast before [sia]
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been [sia]
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like !wow!
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it [lah] but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider #maju# [lah]
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
[ah]
[ah] ya ya same same like #maju# [lah]
I mean
okay [lor]
sick wait with incentives is hundred right
I think with incentive is like <malay>seratus</malay> [eh]

then silver is three hundred then the max is
the max is five hundred [lah] the gold

no action also #sian#
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff

(uh) I think then it was at
marina stadium there [ah] then what they did was what I had to do was (err)
I just accompany them on the boat

I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do

what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about [sia]
is it like is it like like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like !wow! this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any #manga# before [sia]

now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good [sia]
but that's
black panther [eh]
[ah] ya black widow I think
end of the year [ah]

the whole marvel scene
<malay>dari</malay> start <malay>sampai habis</malay>
so you <malay>tengok</malay> the infinity wars <malay>semua tu</malay>

[orh]
but now what he doing [sia]
is it
[oh] ya
<malay>ayam penyet</malay> [oh] the one at science block [ah]
after
I see serious
[orh]
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions [lah]
that's what he don't have
ya [sia] that [one] !wah! that [one] #shiok# [eh]
but
coney island [ah]
is literally coney island group
okay [lah] then we got one more year you want you want
[eh] no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
!huh! no [ah]
I mean
I that day try to keep up with you all also I want to <malay>pengsan</malay> already bro
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
[oh] ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and #hasif# got the gazelles team
the #hasif#
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool [eh] and
but sad [lah] like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked #imran# [lah] like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun [lah]
I miss playing football [sia]
why [sia]
[orh]
is the clutch game [ah]
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers [lah] then
then I think #hasif# just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya [lah] quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
they all like very selfish with the ball so then <malay>tak</malay> pass
and it's just play amongst themselves and me [lah] so is like
unfair to others [lah] so I think they decided to leave
but that one #safi# #jio#
so then they stayed for long they were good [lah] but then ya just selfish [lor]
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play [sia]
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then (uh) I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
(err) think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then !wah! I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged [lor]
but by then they all would have played at right
!wah! #shiok# [sia] !wah! #shiok#
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time [lah] before before like
before
year two okay [lah] year two was fun [lah]
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky [lah] they get to travel that [one]
ya not bad [ah]
(err) <malay>bulan</malay>
<malay>bulan tujuh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay>
exam so <malay>kita kat sana untuk</malay>
ya ya
so <malay>kat sana untuk</malay>
<malay>satu minggu</malay> [ah] ya so I mean school [lah] so
#bo# #pian# [lah] so it's just like
you just go there then you learn about their healthcare system
<malay>pastu pergi mana</malay>
(err) some of the hospital [lah] <malay>kat sana</malay>
get to know like they are how their
how the hospital works actually they all I was surprised [sia] like their
they quite
not say backwards [lah] but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old [lah]
ya maybe ya cause that [one] was up a mountain [leh]
but it was quite cool [lah] then
try #soba# then the
(err) we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go #dublin# right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good [lah] so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan [ah]
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya [ah]
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure [oh] ya that is true
ya [sia] ya [sia]
how you got learn [ah]
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya
macarons
isn't that like super sweet or something
the capsule [ah]
[orh]
!wah! sounds tough [sia]
I do (err) during the circuit breaker at what they are
I mainly bake cake also #pandan# cake
(err) what other cake
(err) was it
butter
honey pound [ah] ya but then like
and all my like asked me like [eh] why you suddenly like start baking then like I got bored [ah]
but all the baking was just like just to relieve stress [lor] cause I think that period was also like exam period
then like !wah! I just want to take my mind off it [lah] so <malay>buat kek</malay> [ah]
ya then
ya [lor] that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell [lah]
it was just like at home doing nothing
actually it was quite therapeutic [lah] having that like time to myself also
[oh] ya that's true [lah] that's why a lot of people like
they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype [leh]
you me no you did
[oh] ya ya chloe kept on trying [lah] I think #dekai# also kept on trying
[oh] ya [lah]
neighbours
actually mac and cheese I don't know why [sia]
because there was that time when (err)
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself [lah] for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up [sia] then I eat right I can still the taste the flour [eh]
ya maybe [ah] probably probably
!wah! but that one whole week was quite
#shiok# [ah] having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right !wah! is actually
ya
but the
[ah] ya you use what
(mmhmm)
mean
I think I use parmesan parmesan cheese
I think it was not bad
but I also use it to make this pasta recently
I think I made with #fifi#
then like he teach me how to like
make make what's this thing called
make (err) the mushroom more meaty [ah]
so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill [ah]
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like (err)
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
(err) take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside [mah]
then after that he will
he will take
[oh] what he do after that [ah] [oh] ya then he will take
(err) like this
thing to <malay>kemek-kemek</malay> [kan] [ah] like press press
press it then
(err) so you will take out all the moisture !wah! then we make
we use that to make like cream pasta !wah! damn nice [sia]
actually next time right if like after all this
like if can go each other house then
