<EX2>cheebye< [sia] that [one] serious [sia]

no I have no patience in that
wet wipe <malay>tu kat depan tu</malay>
<malay>nak pinjam tadi</malay>
but I'm taking pharmaceutical science so what course I can get [ah] let me check [ah]
<malay>ada ke</malay> nursing
ya
yes I can psycho you
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]

okay
why
then <malay>buat</malay> [lah]
<malay>jap aku tengah cari</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [ah] how to apply
[ah] july admission and then I should take july intake
I think by the time by the time you graduate from your diploma [ah] when april or july itself

ya by the time july <malay>dah boleh</malay> just nice [lah] to apply <malay>sekolah</malay>
[eh] why so good can use account
!yay!
how much you left
how many thousand
!huh!
but how much you left left balance when you when you apply
[eh] then where the rest how come your account
but wasn't that much right
the one that you do full time
my god but it's like [oh] so you left I thought [oh] you left like two thousand
[ah] e-application fee is sixty four dollar twenty cents
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>mana</malay> part <malay>tu tempat tadi</malay>
(mm)
to begin this we view the application guide let's submit your application
ya inclusive of
because <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
because mine I got around I think fifteen K I I thought I got eight K only [eh]
[ah]
but by the time you working you already working full time [what] they should
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
I go then I go to but is under private [what]
consider
(hmm)
psychology [lah]
<malay>aku pada</malay> that time <malay>memang aku nak ambil</malay> psychology <malay>apa</malay>
so that that [one]
that pharmaceutical science is much more <malay>susah</malay> than psychology [sia] actually
ya because my friend said that they you have to <malay>halal</malay> [tau] like legitly <malay>halal</malay> and #rizal#
[ah] sister
(uh) said that the thing is going to be a bit more
I don't know she said it's much much I think it's difficult
(mm)
<malay>macam mana nak tengok macam mana nak tengok dia punya</malay> school [ah] how much is the course
(mmhmm)
how come forty and above is six thousand plus only
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
this [one] should get for him

(mm) (mm)
[oh] okay [lah] just nice
so I don't need I don't need to pay extra

ya I think I'm prepared for this
okay [lah] at least at least I just need to ask him to
pocket up the money
so I can get married [seh]
okay [lah] as long he he support we support each other I think shouldn't be any problem [lah]
<malay>cuma nak kena tahan sabar dengan dia punya perangai</malay> which is
he will blue tick me when he is busy
and he will get back to me later
it's not [ah] because
for me I understand that he's working because for me he still even though he's busy he will get back to me
after that so okay
I don't like to control him also [lah] it's like it's your
you are big enough to know what's what is right what is wrong [ah]
so there's no need for me to keep on telling you
this and that okay you're not a five year old boy that I can just like <malay>macam nak kena bilang kau</malay> [oh] you <malay>tak boleh buat gini</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat gitu</malay> okay you're not a five year old kid okay
[ah] so for me you should know your courtesy and you should know [what]
what is right for you what is wrong for you [lah]
<malay>macam tu</malay>
<malay>dah besar panjang</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua dah tua bangka</malay> [kan]

<malay>tengah hari</malay>
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(mm) okay
I long time never walk already [leh]
(mm)
is this the only course that they have
I don't know I should take counselling or should just take psychology this question be the best
biomedical <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] engineering but (ugh)
no it's not
[ah] to challenge myself
because somebody said I have no life so ya
#rizal#
(mmhmm)
I just give her the look
just give him the look you see you wait you wait [ah] until I do diploma you shut up also
just to shut his mouth [ah]
sorry [ah] my critical thinking is way better than him okay
in a way
(mm) someone with depression [ah]
no
because I myself is already mental health problem
I got
I got anxiety
[ah] it happens
no but in a way the doctors
can see that I have a very bad I have a very bad anxiety when when I lost my mum
the counsellor the counsellor actually saw saw it happen
so it's like no no no I don't need a hug
ya so that what happen when I have psychology problems then eventually slowly I'll get get out of it
then sometimes it came [lah] but it just
sometimes when it came [ah] when it <malay>datang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau tak tahu</malay> [tau] <malay>macam kau tu tu tu cam rasa sawan gitu</malay>
you start to gag
you start to <malay>macam</malay> you feel that <malay>macam</malay> the bad energy coming
so [ah] there's this one point of time I think [ah] #rizal# saw it a few times
because when we (um)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>aku buat</malay> [eh]
I just talk to him <malay>macam biasa</malay> [tau] <malay>nanti</malay> at that all sudden I will start crying
I will just start crying
then it's either that
or I will start to have gag reflex
ya
[ah]
but it only comes like <malay>macam</malay> if really really I'm really under a lot of stress
(mm)
but right now <malay>dah</malay> random [lah] because I think because I'm busy with work
but I partly I will be a bit stress [lah]

after her is me (uh) before before her is me
no #rizal# only know
I was in the logistic duty [lah] <malay>aku angkat berat</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay> I didn't realise I didn't realise I was pregnant also at that point of time
until (uh) my period came a bit earlier
which it came with very
a lot a lot a lot of blood
and I was so tired
<malay>uzur dah tak datang</malay> the <malay>kelakar</malay> part was the <malay>uzur datang</malay> still <malay>datang</malay>
(uh huh)

feel weird [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I don't I don't feel anything I feel a bit weird [lah]
but then <malay>sekali bila</malay> part <malay>yang</malay> the first blood clot <malay>jatuh tu takde pape</malay> [tau] the second time <malay>malam tu bila</malay> part <malay>aku tengah nak tukar</malay> pad [kan] then I saw one small little <malay>kat dalam</malay>
then then I realised I got miscarriage [ah] then my friend I was asking my nurses friend [ah] then my friend said I think yours will be around five to six weeks
already
already five to six old but how you feel right now <malay>aku cakap</malay> I was very tired [lah] I sleep the whole I mean the whole two days I sleep [sia] during my period
<malay>anak</malay> ya in a way [ah]

okay either or
is it
but you bought first hand right
<malay>aku punya</malay> hundred seventy [jer] [sia]
it's a very good condition
then got then then my friend was like telling me [lah] actually you are you did had miscarriage
if you saw that little photos means you <malay>dah</malay> miscarriage already
I don't dare I was I
I don't know whether I want to cry or I want to
I want to like I mean shocked
because I didn't know that I was pregnant
and I was in on logistic duty <malay>aku tengah angkat berat lagi</malay> I didn't know that I was having a baby inside inside my tummy
(mmhmm) <malay>aku</malay> went into that very like
