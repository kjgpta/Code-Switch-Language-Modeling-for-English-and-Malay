!whoa!
okay
I would ask for a a car
<malay>kereta</malay> I will ask for a car and I also ask for money
and I will also ask for an unlimited supply of <malay>kasut</malay>
shoes
for anything any type of shoes I would want
so like so <malay>pape kalau aku nak main bola ke main</malay>
<malay>takraw sepak takraw ke boleh</malay>
<malay>pakai apa apa-apa kasut</malay> [lah]
so ya
so what about you #akid#
okay okay
actually <malay>pandai</malay> [ah]
but I think also genie <malay>sesuai kalau</malay> genie is the one granting your wishes [ah]
you know what I mean
so ya
(hmm)
genie
genie the people who grant your wishes
genie
but I also think genie also have their own set of rules that you cannot ask for more wishes of these things [what]
you never know you know never know
the world is like super mysterious [what]
(hmm)
<malay>entah</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> I know I know but then for for shoe right
[ah] since I already have money right
but I only can ask for this much amount of money
so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right
<malay>cam</malay> [ah] <malay>makin turun turun turun banyak duit</malay> so like
[ah] if I just for unlimited amount of shoes for any type of sports I want right
my money won't go down and I still have time for shoes [what]
so you get where I'm going from
and you know <malay>kereta untuk</malay> you know <malay>gi sini gi sana semua</malay>
for my love life I think
so <malay>kalau kalau aku</malay> [dah] <malay>ada duit ada kereta</malay>
<malay>kasut</malay> is for my own needs [ah] but
these two things already I think is already up there to get like
the girls I want not saying they're they're gold-diggers or anything but like
I'm saying that it would help me
a part to get girls [lah] like a love my love life to kickstart my love life I would say
so ya
so what so what
why you keep talking to me about your love life #akid#
what is wrong with your love life
<malay>apa yang</malay> like
<malay>tak</malay> worth it [lah] of course it's not gonna be worth it what because like
because like you know (err)
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
your life would be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
life <malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah]
easy to say it's like it won't be good [ah] everything will just be everything [oh] I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate [ah] so like
so like you know [ah] sometimes right you need to think about
worth it [ah]
<malay>dapat semua benda</malay> [pe]
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life [ah] for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
[ah]
I mean everybody has their own opinion [what]
their own opinions in life
like <malay>dorang nak apa</malay> like
<malay>sorang ada sorang nya</malay> opinion [pe] so like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you know if our opinions are different right then it is what it is [ah] like ya
so first first first [kan] <malay>aku nak perempuan lawa punya</malay>
[ah] <malay>kalau kalau tak lawa aku tak nak</malay>
!chey! just joking but ya of course [ah] I want a pretty lady in my life and
<malay>hati-hati kena bagus macam</malay>
<malay>hati kena bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>macam hati dia kena bagus kena macam aku nak dia</malay> caring loving
(uh) show respect to my parents like that kind of girl [ah]
in that's what I look for in a girl [ah]
<malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm)
okay we talking about this minor details in women that I look for of course there is [lah] there are a few [ah] so I'll tell you about my life [ah] like I can be honest [ah] <malay>dalam hidup aku</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku keluar dengan tiga perempuan</malay> [jer] [tau]
<malay>tiga perempuan</malay> the first one she can make me laugh she (uh) <malay>boleh buat aku ketawa semua</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> take it one step too far she make me laugh too much
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say [lah] like too playful [ah]
like <malay>macam dia suka main-main aku</malay> text <malay>tak nak</malay> reply <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>abeh berbual</malay> serious
serious <malay>punya benda dia</malay>
<malay>dia macam buat macam kelakar semua</malay> then you know
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she [ah] <malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
handle jokes <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>kena aku selalu kena</malay> care for her [ah] like
<malay>takleh kena takleh kena sikit ke apa</malay> [ah]
then <malay>bila berbual dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>nak buat macam</malay> joke <malay>kelakar semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia nak sepak aku sepak muka aku ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari gaduh</malay> so the third one right
she's a good mix in between [ah] like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall [ah]
but then turns out I'm not her type [ah] so if that that one I cannot do anything [ah] but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course [ah] every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus [ah]
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
to be needy you know like I don't want her to be too needy like <malay>selalu</malay>
like <malay>dia selalu macam</malay>
<malay>cari aku dia nak ni dia nak ni</malay>
so like <malay>semua benda semua benda dia</malay>
like <malay>cari aku</malay>
then <malay>aku kena pergi sana jumpa dia berbual dengan dia dia nak nangis aku kena gi sana semua</malay>
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want [ah] I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
<malay>cam dia tengah</malay> contact <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>satu orang satu laki ke kau takut</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
!whoa!
[ah]
feeling feeling <malay>kau macam mana</malay> feeling
happy <malay>gila ke apa</malay>
process [ah]
process your morning
you're like in a fifty fifty state of mind [lah] <malay>kalau dia</malay> reply then
<malay>kau berbual kalau dia tak</malay> reply then
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [jer] [ah]
[ah] okay

[ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa tu kerja apa aku tak ingat</malay> [ah] but then ya
[a'ah]
so like <malay>macam</malay> start conversation <malay>dengan dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cam</malay>
<malay>berbual</malay>
did she seem like interested in you <malay>dia macam</malay>
(um) <malay>ada tunjuk kau dia ada suka kau ke ada</malay>
(mm)
it was just like out the blue [ah]
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first first everything [lah]
it's like your first breakup [ah] you don't know how to handle [lah]
[oh]
I couldn't take it [lah] <malay>aku nangis cam</malay> day and night <malay>aku nangis nangis aku pun tak tahu asal aku nangis</malay>
<malay>kalau aku fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu pun aku asal aku nangis</malay>
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments [what] but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs [what]
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like [oh] this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated [ah] some would say
so ya
but then when she
<malay>minta dia nak minta</malay> break
<malay>dia nak minta</malay> breakup then <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [lah] like we never say anything but we there was no like
labels [ah] I would say
like <malay>kita kita tak</malay> label
<malay>kita macam</malay> boyfriend girlfriend <malay>mata air tak</malay>
<malay>kita tak macam kita macam</malay> just go with the flow [ah]
<malay>boleh cakap gitu</malay> [ah] go with the flow [jer]
(mm)
so you just became like a emotional guy [ah]
<malay>cam jadi</malay> emotional [ah]
like you just needed like reasons [ah] like you want to solve it [ah] like you don't want to just breakup
like that [ah]
like <malay>kau tak nak</malay> let go <malay>dia cam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>kau nak macam</malay> rebuilt <malay>semua</malay> you know
so like you try to you know talk to her [lah] but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you [ah]
she
move on [ah] so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky [lah] your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good [ah] because like
[sial] [lah] <malay>aku pun nak</malay> [sia] <malay>kalau</malay> first try <malay>dapat macam boleh cam</malay> like the perfect girlfriend
like the perfect wife [ah] <malay>boleh cakap</malay>
so like ya [lah]
[a'ah] [seh]
this one <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> [kan]
in this world [ah]
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
<malay>tak</malay> this is different because right anything you want for free
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
[a'ah]
<malay>satu benda</malay> [jer] <malay>benda</malay> free
<malay>apa-apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>tak tak muak ke hari-hari makan</malay> Pizza Hut
so what did you leave her for someone
(mm)
so like you pretty much just stalk her first [ah] <malay>cam tengok orang ni macam mana</malay>
so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
<malay>ni perempuan macam</malay> not bad [ah]
<malay>cam</malay> this is the [one] [ah]
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
(mm)
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings [ah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> fade [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] that's good that's good
[ah] to be honest [ah]
it depends on how the break up went [ah]
<malay>kau faham tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kita punya</malay> break up <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau punya macam senang macam</malay> just ended smoothly like no hiccups or anything then okay [lah] <malay>boleh jadi kawan tapi macam</malay>
<malay>kawan pun bukan macam</malay> best friend <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kawan macam</malay> low-key <malay>macam boleh cakap</malay> [ah] hi bye friends [ah]
<malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> technically <malay>kawan tak</malay> [ah] you know what I mean
it's like
ya
so like
but then <malay>kalau</malay> break up <malay>macam rabak kita macam gaduh semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> like
try <malay>jadi kawan balik macam susah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
what's the point [kan] ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't [ah]
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends [ah]
do you still searching for love or anything
[ah]
[oh]
[ah]
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh]
(mm)
[ah]
you just try to care for her [lah] like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares [ah]
[ah]
that's
that's a super hard question [ah] because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] like [ah] <malay>kalau aku</malay> just break up then <malay>aku nak</malay> move on it takes me like at least at least [ah] four months I would say
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended [ah]
like
it really depends on the person [ah] like <malay>kalau aku cam</malay>
<malay>kalau aku</malay> handsome <malay>gila ke apa ke</malay> then (uh)
<malay>senang-senang dapat perempuan semua aku tak</malay> [kan] move on
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>berapa berapa lama</malay> [kan]
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on [lah]
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this [one]
were you still moving on
ya
(mm)
your second girl your ex [lah]
[ah]
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
it's not wrong [ah] it's not completely wrong <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] <malay>kalau cam</malay> care <malay>pasal</malay> ex <malay>kau ke apa</malay> it's not wrong it's like
<malay>macam</malay>
how you say [ah] like you like imagine if you lost your phone right and <malay>kau hilang</malay> then
<malay>tu benda tu</malay> phone <malay>kau takleh cari mana-mana</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [ah]
<malay>ni mesti macam</malay> two years down the road two years the road <malay>kau mesti fikir balik</malay> [eh]
phone <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>aku rasa kat kat sini ke</malay>
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that [ah]
it's like something that is lost can never be found again [ah]
<malay>dorang cakap</malay> [ah]
people say this one
so like ya
(ugh)
ya
totally not wrong
(mm)
in my in my relationships [ah] my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me [ah] I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like <malay>macam</malay>
example [eh] example <malay>macam</malay> one of the times (err)
<malay>ni perempuan dia nak berbual dengan aku dia sedih dia nak</malay> she needs someone to talk to [ah] pretty much so I just decided like <malay>macam tapi aku aku tengah main</malay> game
