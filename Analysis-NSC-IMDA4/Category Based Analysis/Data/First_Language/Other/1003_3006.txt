what if
[eh] what [ah]
ya means can give full bottle already [lah]
I don't know because because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this [one] is I don't know
ya how [eh] when to increase milk
too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can [eh] as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty [ah]
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
so ya [lah] <malay>dia nak masuk</malay> two months already
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can [ah]
ya
[oh] ya I <malay>lupa</malay> I need to call seoul garden <malay>bukan</malay> need to call I want to call seoul garden ya I <malay>lupa abeh dia punya</malay> time <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
