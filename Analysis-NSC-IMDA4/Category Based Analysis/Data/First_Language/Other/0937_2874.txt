and you will be comforted
like anyway <malay>pasal buku aku yang aku cakap tadi tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> !hey! <malay>bukan yang buku tu aku cakap buku aku sendiri setan</malay>
I'm telling you that I wanted to buy
no it's not lit it's just a book that I read for fun two years ago
you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
is that at first <malay>ada satu lelaki ni lelaki ni</malay> something happen to him there's something wrong with him I can't remember what's wrong because it was two years ago when I read it
<malay>tapi sebab dia ada</malay> accident
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
then he met this girl <malay>rambut dia</malay> is like silver <malay>rambut dia</malay> silver <malay>lepas tu dia cantik gila</malay> according to the description
he didn't fell in love at first
he saw the girl and he saw the girl <malay>punya</malay> purse <malay>dalam tu ada</malay> like <malay>berjuta-juta</malay> cash so being like a poor ass human being he stole his her purse he stole then he tried to walk away from her hotel but then he felt bad then he came back and he wanted to take his notebook
and then eventually like they got closer and closer it's like <malay>macam</malay> your basic korean story although it's not korean then after that (um) they did what they had to do and this guy that guy was trying to help the girl from suicide
and then like they help through each other [ah] but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
and it's !oi! <malay>jangan buat bising</malay> [lah]
!oi! it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front [oh] okay I'm sorry I can't remember

you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
<malay>mana</malay> you need to <malay>pandai cari</malay> [lah] you cannot obviously find those <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>apa tu yang</malay> what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself <malay>kalau</malay> shop <malay>tu ada</malay> brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something <malay>yang tak ada</malay> brand <malay>sebab</malay> okay if I tell you (um) chanel
a bag from chanel or a <malay>baju</malay> from chanel and a <malay>baju</malay> from H&M but it's the same exact <malay>baju</malay> it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop

he's like I don't know he like to sleep like dozen places you know he like to hide under the sofa
and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also <malay>suka bilik mak aku</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>bilik mak aku</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dia dah</malay> romantic mood

I want blackout curtains so when you close the curtains you cannot see any light at all
you bet I'm going to sleep the whole day girl
<malay>asal</malay>
[ah] <malay>sebab kau</malay> [kan] vampire
<malay>tingkap pun tak nak buka</malay>
<malay>asal kau tak nak buka tingkap</malay>
so your house is like just <malay>dua tingkat</malay> you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the <malay>tingkap</malay> near your <malay>bilik</malay> it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
why you
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
<malay>tapi</malay> our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
<malay>tu</malay> the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful <malay>macam</malay> bacterias in the air and then <malay>keluarkan</malay> the cool air
I cannot understand <malay>punya</malay> fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
like last time before was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
[oh] wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby #jungkook# now he's so !aww!
he has like !wow! I know him <malay>badan dia</malay> like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ</malay>
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
!oi!
why
why not
I'm not saying maisonette is like <malay>atas bawah</malay> [tau] <malay>rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu</malay>
or condo
why you don't
one why
why then we might as well live with your parents
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it <malay>macam</malay> you want your own space
why [oh] because you just live in your room [eh] <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>dah terbiasa gitu</malay> [lah] [oh] okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay>
so [ah] <malay>rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun</malay>
(uh huh) <malay>atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku</malay> P three
<malay>cerita dia pasal kampung</malay> girl [a'ah] <malay>dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay>
and then it got really complicated <malay>aku tak pernah habis baca sebab</malay> I find the character so cringey
and it's like <malay>macam</malay> about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but <malay>aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa</malay> she would like it I guess
[ah] about <malay>apa</malay> don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> even the like okay so that day I ask her like
I don't know what I ask her [ah] and after that she suddenly said like her mum [ah] did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like [oh] then why why is she not working because I legit ask [ah] out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said [ah]
what [ah] to <malay>jaga</malay> her <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very #atas# lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the that type of lifestyle [kan] it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
like that time <malay>ada</malay> thing but then in the end she managed to go also [pe]
ya [lah] <malay>ngok</malay>
ya
ya
I mean
why
<malay>apa dia</malay>
serious [ah] <malay>asal</malay>
[ah] <malay>selalu gitu</malay> [oh] my god girl you want me to get started on christina and #ulfa# [eh] no <malay>salah nama</malay> christina and #insha#
so you don't know #insha# and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them <malay>ada</malay> boyfriend [kan] however the thing with #insha# is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird <malay>sebab macam</malay> it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team [lah] I would have like shouted at her but then [oh] my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
and like <malay>macam</malay> okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like <malay>macam</malay> you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay #insha# did to christina so on like
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on #insha# story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then [ah]
she she said that <malay>macam kalau</malay> in terms of <malay>apa</malay>
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina <malay>tapi</malay> ya that's not how it is
<malay>dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar</malay> together they did a double date <malay>lepas tu azhari</malay> didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why #azhari# didn't pay for it but then #akif# paid for it like christina <malay>punya</malay> boyfriend he paid for <malay>insha punya</malay> cable car ride
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars
<malay>sot tak sot</malay> [sia]
