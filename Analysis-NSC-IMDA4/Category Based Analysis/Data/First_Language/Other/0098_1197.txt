[eh] D <malay>dah lama tak jumpa</malay> (uh) <malay>awak sekarang tengah buat apa ni</malay>
<malay>tak ada kerja</malay>
!alamak! (uh) lynn <malay>sekarang tengah kerja kat</malay> catering kitchen [ah] <malay>buat kerja</malay> part time <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak kerja</malay> (uh) I <malay>boleh ajak</malay> you <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>awak nak tak</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah] ya ya ya I remember her
(mmhmm)
!alamak! <malay>kesian</malay>
[oh] really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
(mm) I'm not so sure I think you can do some (uh) admin job duties I know in my workplace (uh) sometimes we have (um) we need we get orders from customers for #bentos# or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to (uh) hire someone for the time being especially during this period [lah]
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
(mm) I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay #hijabis# not (uh) not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this (um) poll [lah] (uh) asking whether like have any of us malay #hijabis# ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset [lah] like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
[oh]
(mm)
!wah!
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry (uh) for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab (err) restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried [oh] let's say what if the medicine or anything like
<malay>kena</malay> the hijab then later got stains all those germs [mah] so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always (uh) how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
and I think in social media it has been blowing up [ah] but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay [lah] [ha]

standing near this guy from school of engineering so (uh) I was like his shirt quite cute [eh] he wear spider-man shirt then I was like [oh] I like your shirt it looks cute then he was like [oh] thank you then after that (um) suddenly (uh)
we were doing some other things [ah] so after the block visit right we were sitting down then after that he was like playing with the cat obviously I went to him but not because of him [lah] I went to the cat cause I like cats [mah] so I was like playing with the cat I was then suddenly we were like talking and talking cause like we both like cats so we like started talking [lah]
and then he said (uh) can we exchange numbers cause you know for the (uh) final year project I was like okay [lah] I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay [lah] why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right (uh) what is that movie [ah] marvel is it not star wars <malay>apa</malay> movie <malay>tu yang</malay> viral
