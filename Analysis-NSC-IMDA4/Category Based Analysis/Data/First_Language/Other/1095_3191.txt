she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like (um)
I see okay I ask her [lah] [oh] when you have one dollar then I start <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia dah</malay> then I say what is that
(uh)
[oh] like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like !hey! I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like !huh! maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
then <malay>baru dia</malay> like
okay okay and (uh)
that's usual [lah] cause #ilan# was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you [what]
timetable [kan]
I never teach her timetable [lah] I always subtraction <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> count backwards
<malay>dengan tu</malay>
like like she can even ask me like when I said
like <malay>apa</malay> (um)
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
[eh] (err) one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me (err) is it (err) minus or plus
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money [ah] or you lose money or you take away and she go [oh] <malay>duit</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> no I find <malay>dia tak</malay> grasp the concept <malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>dia cuma</malay> like [oh] I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent [ah]
ya ya ya that kind of thing
like #ilan# is some one <malay>senang nak tangkap sebab dia</malay>
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff [lah]
but for her <malay>dia punya</malay> ya the concept
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her [ah]
then I because I at the same time <malay>aku pun</malay> spring clean #ilan's# room I threw quite a lot like all those also gonna throw (err) except for that cotton on (uh) paper bag [ah] <malay>tu barang-barang</malay>
