<malay>dia tak</malay> lightweight it's very <malay>berat</malay> it's like eleven
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> (err) I like thinking [lah] whether to get or not because at first
cause at first <malay>macam</malay> there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that [one] like <malay>besar gila</malay> and then but that [one] can put two people in two babies two babies
your head [lah] how can you sit ya you see you see <malay>tengok tengok</malay> show me ya that [one] that [one] the the <malay>tu</malay> [a'ah] <malay>cantik</malay> [kan] that's why you you see the video it's
<malay>cantik</malay> [kan] [ah] actually <malay>dia ada</malay> another one it's called Nuna Mixx <malay>ini</malay> Nuna Mixx next <malay>yang</malay> Nuna Mixx <malay>tu dia</malay> fold <malay>sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh</malay> shorten so <malay>dia macam dia</malay> compact (err) so <malay>yang ni yang baru ni dia</malay> compact and very
<malay>apa tu</malay> <malay>dia</malay> fold just nice [ah] and it can stand on its own and then <malay>dia boleh</malay> recline <malay>sampai</malay> [ah] lay very flat <malay>untuk</malay> baby <malay>baring</malay> ya and then <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> canopy <malay>boleh tarik sampai kat bawah</malay> the canopy the <malay>tu</malay> the cover <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>bila dia tidur</malay> then like sunlight right either that or you [ah] you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
twin stroller talking about
demi grow
!huh! what
[orh] I no I I don't want to get a bassinet because bassinet only can use (uh) like zero to six month [jer] [seh] then if like
like no you use up to six months after that <malay>lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi</malay>
because it's not meant for after six months [lah]
it's meant for something like that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is heavy or probably the height or weight is not [ah] suitable <malay>untuk dorang</malay> anymore
according to the person [lah]
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that <malay>macam kalau</malay> I want to take grab <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
it's like ya then I can just yes ya it's easier [lah]
because only grab can use (uh) if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat <malay>kalau</malay> you take taxi <malay>tak payah</malay> car seat
<malay>cik</malay> #usop# [kan] <malay>kawan abah cik</malay> #usop# [ah] what [oh] my god my toe <malay>sakit gila skit gila</malay>
my toe
it looks swollen
really
<malay>tapi</malay> why [seh] why is it even swollen [eh]
no cannot be !alah! I scared I scared it's (err) gout again [seh]
no [lah] I scared [lah] cause that time I also <malay>sakit kaki</malay> again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the <malay>dia nya tu</malay>
how it works ya you will see how how <malay>dia punya tu</malay> works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the <malay>belakang</malay> the <malay>belakang</malay> is meshed is like <malay>macam</malay> like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part <malay>lepas tu</malay> when she <malay>baring</malay> [kan] <malay>belakang dia dia boleh rasa</malay> [ah] <malay>panas</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay> the air and then this [one] also <malay>boleh buat</malay> like bassinet bassinet
because <malay>bawah dia punya</malay> feet area [kan] you can just snap out <malay>dia punya</malay> feet area <malay>tu</malay> then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that [lah]
ya
I love the colour also the colour is nice
ya ya ya ya you can you can ya ya that's one thing I like I like the handle handle bar
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar <malay>sebab dia</malay> colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because <malay>dia boleh pusing</malay> and baby can face me instead
ya
ya and then like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down <malay>dia tepi dia ada</malay> net <malay>ada</malay> meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the <malay>barang</malay> to <malay>sampai</malay> next week I think about seven days
what <malay>baju</malay> (mm) (mm)

and then washing machine <malay>pun belum habis</malay> the washing machine haven't finish [ah] so many things to do need <malay>dia ada</malay> dryer <malay>kat dalam dia</malay> but ya dryer <malay>dia</malay> is not is not [ah] drying [lah] <malay>tapi nak kena</malay> like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to <malay>sangkut sidai</malay> outside
outside [ah] but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe <malay>kalau balik rumah</malay> #jurong# I will just bring bring along <malay>kalau macam</malay> I stay <malay>lama</malay> [ah]
[ah] ya <malay>tapi</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh</malay> like like everyday <malay>dia basuh</malay> like <malay>dua tiga kalau</malay> jeans jeans <malay>susah</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> laundry mat it's okay [lah] just get laundry mat [lah] better [what] can wash all <malay>satu kali ni</malay> wash <malay>dua tiga kali nak kena</malay> wash [seh] as in cause <malay>banyak</malay> [kan] so <malay>kalau baju</malay> baby okay [ah] <malay>baju</malay> baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything <malay>masuk dalam tapi bila</malay> drying <malay>dia</malay> [kan] it's <malay>sikit sebab dia punya</malay> drying is <malay>dalam</malay> basket <malay>kecil tu</malay> you have to keep inside that basket <malay>kecil</malay> then <malay>kalau letak banyak-banyak</malay> it won't <malay>kering</malay>
I mean it's good cause <malay>kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan</malay> ya socks underwears all the small small [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see [ah] if he even if he wash this [one] right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to <malay>cuci</malay> to dry <malay>satu kali</malay> and is more saving [lah] <malay>dari dia pergi pergi bawah</malay> then washing machine and then after that you know [oh] no <malay>cuci</malay> is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash <malay>kat sini kat dalam</malay> washing machine <malay>ni</malay>
he just go down do it use the dryer
