okay so the topics that we will be talking today [ah] it's (um) firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
(um) fifty <malay>betul</malay>
so <malay>maknanya kalau</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau</malay> if you <malay>yang</malay> in ten years time <malay>memang</malay> you want to be in an area <malay>yang ada laut yang ada</malay> greenery where
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>kalau untuk saya</malay> for me [eh] I think [eh]
for me [ah] I like science [lah] so maybe ten years in the future [kan] I would want to have
I would like to live in my own lab <malay>atau</malay> garage
and maybe <malay>sebelah</malay> would be my like lab apparatus <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and [ah] whatever there is [lah] so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also (uh) ten years time probably (um) I would like to
(uh) I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
so if I have my own lab I would probably (uh) maybe add a telescope <malay>atau</malay> like some meeting devices so that I can
focus on my (uh)
my computing whatsoever [lah]
yes
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe (uh) so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so (mm)
<malay>katanya</malay> if say let's say you were
(uh) you were in your future house
and then (um) maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
(mm)
mind is stimulated [ah]
martial arts <malay>gitu</malay>
(uh) more to like action thriller
<malay>macam nak kena</malay>
(uh) okay for for me (uh) I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you (uh) in-hand situations about (uh) about issues that could surface in the future [lah] (uh) technology areas or
(uh) any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and (um) I think it it it gives me like <malay>macam</malay>
something to think about
ya and and make you like [oh] it helps me to
solve problems easily and (uh) see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode [eh]
<malay>yang satu orang ni</malay> (uh) she was actually (uh) she was actually trapped in a spaceship
the reason why she was trapped is because (um)
(uh) her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
computed her body into into a technological (uh) into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone [ah] <malay>orang sendiri</malay> [tau] so
so the boss <malay>memang memang jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>gilanya orang</malay>
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting [lah] how they plan to (uh) get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then [ah] sometimes he can [ah] turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked [lah] cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end (uh) some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so (uh) he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and (uh) there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape [lah] so it was quite surprising interesting [ah] how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that [eh] (hmm)
if you can become an actor
(uh) what
(hmm) if you can become an actor [eh] and like any actor [eh] do you prefer (uh) do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
like their their image you know what I mean <malay>faham tak</malay> ya so an image of them self you mean <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ada</malay> fit body <malay>atau</malay> good looks
<malay>kenapa</malay>
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
I think I will
I think I agree on that [lah] <malay>sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then <malay>buat apa</malay> [lah]
ya so I think for me <malay>kalau ada</malay> fit body is more satisfying <malay>sebab</malay>
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without without health actually (um) you can be bedridden and even the the cost of (uh)
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is [ah] not getting cheaper these days
so I think (uh) focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases [ah] correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
so <malay>macam</malay> I think health is very important [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> without health <malay>memang</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> much [lah] you can't do much actually
<malay>mencegah</malay>
<malay>kena</malay> start <malay>awal</malay> [lah]
so I think one <malay>kalau</malay> pot from having a fit body [eh]
I think
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind <malay>sebab sekarang memang</malay> as you can see [eh] mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth (err) among the working adults and among (um) teens
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be (um) how can mental health be (um) what's that addressed
and how can be (um)
how can we (uh) better improve our mental health area general
<malay>cara</malay> holistic [lah]
I think mental health also like (uh) stems from other external factors <malay>macam</malay> maybe overwhelming of
school work <malay>atau</malay>
(uh) projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have [lah] that they experience so (um) like if you can see like the education system <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang memang</malay> very (uh)
very rigorous very very broad and very
it's very intense [lah] so like what <malay>macam</malay>
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and <malay>macam memang</malay> I've been schooling [ah] and I think <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
(uh) rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given [ah] should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity [ah]
but <malay>tu memang</malay>
(uh) off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system [ah] like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but it doesn't really appease them so I think <malay>macam</malay> apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but (uh) everything has been changing and revolutionised
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
(uh) it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless <malay>sebab apa</malay> [tau] if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you <malay>macam</malay> just just <malay>kasi semua</malay> on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
(um)
(um) how many one point two grams of (uh) phosphorus is needed to make (uh) I don't know cyanide or something
<malay>macam</malay> apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics [lah] and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion <malay>bila macam</malay>
you can think of how to (uh) not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
<malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] [kan]
okay so (uh) moving on maybe let's talk about
(mm) okay so <malay>contohnya</malay> like for now [eh] we are in the twentieth twenty first century
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever [ah] where would you want to go
and why
ya
<malay>cuba</malay> like for example [eh] you <malay>ternampak</malay> a time capsule
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
[oh] when you were a little child
work studies stress [ah]
we play
(mm)
I think that's <malay>pun</malay> what I would really <malay>macam</malay> really cherish enjoy
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
(uh) memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
(um) shape you and how you are today
[ah]
probably (mm)
I I think I would want to go to
<malay>zaman</malay>
I don't know maybe <malay>zaman rasulullah</malay> <malay>atau</malay> dark ages [ah] cause (um) basically the dark ages were <malay>macam</malay> a period of time
the <malay>macam</malay>
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby (uh) in the european universe or the western part of the world
[ah] there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but (uh) there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
(um) ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and [ah] people were killed and people were died from (um)
(um) unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
(uh) the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know #sina# [ah] #al jazali#
(uh) #mariam#
#rolab# and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science <malay>bila</malay> there's this two brothers
#abu sayde# or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam [lah] I think it's very interesting to see
I think it's very interesting to see <malay>macam</malay>
the the progression during that period of times <malay>sebab sebab</malay> during that time <malay>memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan</malay> idea <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>seperti</malay>
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
during the golden age and I find it really interesting <malay>sebab</malay> how their mind
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
even in engineering and science and (uh) it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's (um) <malay>macam kita jarang tengok</malay> [ah]
<malay>dalam dunia ni sekarang</malay> [tau] most of the time [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang macam contohnya</malay> [eh] I have to (um) <malay>contohnya</malay> I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine (uh) philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once [lah] but I think <malay>macam</malay> ya I think it'll be very interesting [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you can like learn
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
<malay>sebab saya rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita</malay> just go far
<malay>sebab ilmu tu mana-mana</malay> and you can use for <malay>ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu</malay>
you [ah]
<malay>ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa</malay> as long as <malay>kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik</malay> and I think it will be very fruitful [lah]
<malay>ilmu</malay>
so apart from like
(mm) going back in time
(um) what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to (uh) have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to (um) to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal [lah] you particularly the elderly man take
(um) <malay>duit ke rumah ke</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay>
the third one
[ah]
(uh) I think first [lah] I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
(uh) I wish
(uh) I wish that (uh) world hunger can be stopped [lah] cause
or war actually can be stopped cause technically (um) <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau boleh</malay> share but technically like (uh) world hunger among there are many (um) palestinians
and they went in first world country
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [seh] <malay>orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang</malay> now <malay>orang</malay> [eh] actually <malay>tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada</malay> no access to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from (uh) camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad [lah] so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope [ah] nobody would go hungry [lah] in this world
and [ah] the second wish would be [ah]
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause (uh) we don't have the technology
because even from (um) the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
[eh] three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so (um) I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out (um) others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish (uh) actually (uh) I think I
I wish to have my own family one day #inshallah#
maybe next five ten years or so
so I think (um) having a family really <malay>macam</malay>
really helps me to
(uh) have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me [lah] I really like to learn
and <malay>kalau ada suami</malay> I would be able to
find solace in him cause <malay>memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan</malay> [kan] so I think having a spouse would be very interesting [lah]
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but (um) just hope to you know
(um) get married one day
okay so (mm)
so maybe (uh) cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
<malay>akhlak yang baik</malay> [lah]
I eat right
I think (uh) I think
<malay>tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I can feel you [lah] I think having (uh) having status
is not really essential [lah] but apparently
(uh) you want your friend or anything
even if you want me to have good <malay>akhlak</malay>
how can I contribute better to the society
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal</malay> okay <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>kita kurang berakhlak</malay>
<malay>tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada duit yang banyak tapi akhlak kita</malay>
<malay>hancur</malay> [tau]
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
<malay>akhlak</malay> is more valuable [lah] than intellect
<malay>akhlak</malay> [lah] actually even if you have your own
(uh) if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be (uh) be taught to the world
but (um) having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life [lah]
yup
respect
won't look down on you [lah]
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>buat yang baik</malay> [lah]
you <malay>tak ada gunanya</malay>
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's (um)
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you [lah] that (uh) having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
maybe like (um) what do you think if you <malay>macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam</malay> superpower
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> superpower like you <malay>nak jadi apa kalau</malay> what what what will you like to have right now
flash
speed [ah] speed
#inshallah#
<malay>kalau ada barang nak kemas</malay> #inshallah# [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you know I <malay>rasa</malay>
(uh huh)
I I like to teleport [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> teleport [kan]
I <malay>takkan lambatnya</malay> cause I'm like always late <malay>kalau dapat</malay> teleport then <malay>macam</malay> on on the speed of light or even faster than that (uh) just like be wherever I want to be just teleport <malay>tak tak payah nak</malay> passport <malay>semua</malay> so I think that's very cool [ah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau dapat</malay> teleport [lah]
I think the current technology <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] unless <malay>kita ada</malay> transporter <malay>macam kat</malay> star trek <malay>ke</malay> but of course not [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi contohnya</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau macam</malay> now's the <malay>kalau</malay> cause <malay>sekarang</malay> <malay>memang</malay> is in progress [lah] what what do you think of
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
phones <malay>pun</malay> is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
(mmhmm)
<malay>sekarang</malay> google [jer]
you know is is very easily easy [lah] I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
<malay>macam kerja rumah semua terbengkalai</malay>
I think okay [lah] maybe <malay>salah saya juga</malay> <malay>sebab</malay> phone <malay>tu memang</malay> it serves like an educational purpose [lah]
ya and the entertainment purpose <malay>untuk zaman sekarang</malay>
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like [oh] [ah] when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like (um) we have (uh) we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry (um) some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to (um) playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind [lah] that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
(err) is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation [lah]
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think (uh) (uh) this thing
trait between and humans probably (uh) they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have (um)
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans <malay>ada</malay> this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things <malay>tapi macam</malay> they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very (um) like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think <malay>agaknya</malay> also I feel it's on the good side [lah] because
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
(uh) some (uh) some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
important I think apart from that I think <malay>macam</malay> humans should actually still take care of their parents and <malay>macam</malay> don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and <malay>contohnya macam</malay>
(uh) for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
(uh) like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> limit to it
I think one <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>pun</malay> very subjective [lah] <malay>sebab kita orang tak tahu</malay> like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something [lah] something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
I think ya technically <malay>macam</malay> you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world <malay>macam</malay> india they are very overpopulated <malay>kalau kita dah ada</malay> robot <malay>lagi mana nak letak</malay> [seh] human <malay>ni</malay> so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> you have to find a contingency plan <malay>sebab memang dunia ni</malay> maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting [lah] to actually to predict and cause nowadays <malay>memang</malay>
(um) especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be (um) probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
(uh) like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it [lah]
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
humans <malay>dorang betul-betul kena</malay>
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting [ah] to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from (um) human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many (um) so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even <malay>macam</malay> greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser
very interesting
(uh huh)
