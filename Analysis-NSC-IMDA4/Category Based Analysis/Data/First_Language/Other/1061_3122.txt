!hey! how are you
<malay>dah lama tak nampak kau</malay>
<malay>tak ingat</malay> [seh] I think like since COVID about
<malay>macam</malay>
almost two months ago
[kan]
<malay>betul tak</malay>
<malay>asal kau ketawa</malay> [ah] <malay>kau teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti</malay>
[a'ah] that time <malay>yang aku</malay> video call <malay>kau tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kau ingat tak</malay> what happen that time
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
(mmhmm)
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] [sia] like a blessing in disguise [ah] [eh]
okay [lah]
<malay>kerja aku rabak juga</malay> [ah] like because I don't know whether
you heard
but
(um) <malay>kerja aku</malay> recently <malay>buang orang</malay> like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left <malay>semua nak kena buat</malay> you know pick up the slack <malay>abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat</malay>
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now [lah] but (um) you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done [ah]
ya actually I am most of the time only like (err) two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
everything can be done via the laptop [lah] but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to <malay>apa tu</malay> collect <malay>dia punya</malay> physical mails
cause there are some like letters from (err) the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
[eh] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> imagine [sia] like I will I cannot even you know
both of us <malay>ada</malay> short attention span and like to have
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
<malay>abeh</malay> like you can't even like focus and
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time [lah]
a few hours at least
in a week
ya [lah] I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
(mm)
!huh! as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
ya I know you always do [lah] you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere [lah]
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
[oh]
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you [ah] like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
<malay>banyak orang juga</malay> like you know stress eat
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age (um)
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one (um) app away or one call away so
(mm)
is it I never heard of that before
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
[oh]
I see I will check that out I think one day <malay>aku</malay> check it out
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's fun speaking of <malay>joget</malay> recently also like literal you know literally yesterday (err) me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through <malay>macam</malay> dance <malay>punya</malay> youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing [kan] <malay>kau</malay> you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to <malay>kau buat</malay> like (um)
HIIT workouts I mean that works better [lah] because you know it's a specific <malay>punya macam</malay> (err) they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then (um) she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to <malay>apa tu</malay> download
this thing (err) this game <malay>apa</malay> just dance [eh] ya so we've had we've yet to try that (err) it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good [ah]
like you feel more refreshed <malay>abeh nanti kau tak</malay> feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time (err) always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
as cliche as it sounds [lah]
I'm not one to preach but it is important [lah] cause now also <malay>zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang</malay> all fast food and things like that you know as compared to <malay>zaman dulu</malay> [kan] they're more much more
(um) healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my (err) to get my workout in [ah] on a daily
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes <malay>pun jadi</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau tahu tak aku</malay>
highly ambitious <malay>niat tu ada</malay> but <malay>selalu tak kesampaian</malay> like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday <malay>macam berangan</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam kau nak</malay> [oh] <malay>berangan nak</malay> jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour [ah]
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> start the start my day right you know working and then like <malay>macam</malay> feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said [ah] <malay>tadi</malay> you just have to be consistent [ah]
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] is it
(mmhmm)
<malay>kena</malay> monitor [ah]
what's the average [ah] what's the ideal
that's normal [ah] [ah]
that plays a part [ah]
ya (mm)
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
ya like <malay>macam</malay> if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you <malay>macam tak nampak</malay> so tired or worn out [tau]
(mm)
<malay>asal kau menyesal</malay>
ya [lah] it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more (um) you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad [what] I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face [sial] babe
[oh] no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
<malay>aku memang suka</malay> like dark (err) like because I don't know like
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tak lawa sangat</malay> [ah]
ya I hang it like <malay>macam</malay> fairy lights around <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [ah] my my bedroom <malay>punya</malay> frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> because I prefer to use like <malay>macam</malay> candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that <malay>kalau</malay> fairy lights when you switch it on [kan]
okay [lah]
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on [lah]
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings [ah] different modes that you can choose from like <malay>macam</malay> those like blinking ones or like <malay>macam</malay> !alah! you know <malay>macam lampu lap lip</malay> [lah] basically
it's like that
ya
[oh] yes it's right there
ya I use it is <malay>dia macam</malay> aurora lights
no [lah] I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep [lah] <malay>bila aku nak</malay> you know feeling spa day <malay>nak</malay> relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
<malay>bila aku nyanyi</malay> ya <malay>bila aku nyanyi nak</malay> feeling feeling
you know me too well
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>kita dah kawan</malay>
how how long have we known each other

I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
<malay>tak tahu</malay> it's like literally after school it's not
even during school we don't really talk to each other [kan]
[ah] [eh] speaking of which <malay>tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun</malay> like literally random [ah] like <malay>aku tak rapat dengan dia pun</malay> like <malay>tu pun aku</malay> that time <malay>kerja</malay> part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then (err) <malay>kita tak</malay> contact <malay>pun</malay> and then after that random after few years <malay>aku jumpa dia dekat</malay> (err) #tioman# island <malay>ke apa</malay> then random <malay>gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to #bali# and then I met her again just now so <malay>macam</malay> random [lah] like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to <malay>macam</malay> like meet them often but
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
(mmhmm)
[oh] [ah] <malay>tu pun</malay> random [seh] <malay>kau pun pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan dia juga</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
anyway speaking of which how's your love life <malay>dah lama aku tak dengar apa</malay> any anything new that you want to talk to me about
(mm)
(mm)
the last time <malay>kau cakap dengan aku dia</malay>
something about his throat [eh] <malay>sakit ke apa</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>rajin</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
(mm)
ya
(mm)
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know <malay>macam</malay> you gave so much (um) care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return [lah] <malay>kau ikhlas memang</malay> but
you know (um) from what you're telling me
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like <malay>macam</malay> it's one sided like you
like
the effort
is only at your end
you know then <malay>bila kau sakit tangan ni semua</malay> I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so <malay>macam</malay> he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like <malay>macam</malay> all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times [lah] but
(err) it is all about compromising and <malay>macam</malay> if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
you know like (um) in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
then <malay>entah</malay> [eh] do you really think it's worth it then
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow! that really open up like
a lot of things like <malay>macam</malay>
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay [lah] (um) being in a relationship of friends [ah] like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this (um) saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like (err) people come and go
and especially when the (err) when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men [lah] but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women [eh] I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay (um) you know
(um) you shouldn't get back to your (err) to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly [kan] (err) maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience [lah] but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense [ah] I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
!aww!
!aww! so cute
a book like a diary
[oh] right okay
[oh] my gosh
[eh] but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
[eh] that is actually a good thing like (um) it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know (um) on paper
(mm)
then it hit you [ah]
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like (um)
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
(um)
!aww! <malay>dia</malay> blue tick <malay>kau</malay> [oh] <malay>dia</malay> seen <malay>kau</malay> [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up [ah] then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
[oh] my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes <malay>dia yang paling</malay> decent
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
(mm)
ya [lah] like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up [eh] not not the cause of your okay [lah] somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay [lah] I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya [lah] but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
!aww!
!wow! you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
[eh] [oh] my gosh
I mean
if you may never know <malay>mana tahu</malay>
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly [eh] when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
(err) it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead [lah] it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on (err) cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay [lah]
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know (um) but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so <malay>kau</malay> just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head [kan] <malay>bila kau</malay> like you know
late at night <malay>kau tak boleh tidur</malay> thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
you know
but (err) do you know if he's attached now or not
[oh] my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually [ah] you don't like <malay>macam</malay> don't don't make it obligatory for him
<malay>kau tanya</malay> [jer]
[oh] is it
and then <malay>kau</malay> action [ah] treat him for his birthday or what
ya I don't give a shit anymore [sia] I can't even remember
<malay>bila</malay> birthday <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>dekat tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> action <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
<malay>tak</malay>
ya or (um) no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like (err) <malay>jual mahal</malay> but at the same time like !hey! you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
[eh] isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah (um) let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
(err) do you have any plans <malay>macam</malay> a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like <malay>macam</malay> (err) let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to (err) do you have any plans <malay>macam</malay> like secretly hoping him would to say yes
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
<malay>kau</malay> set reminder set reminder
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
<malay>dia sama</malay> age <malay>dengan kita</malay> [eh] [oh]
[eh] you don't don't say that about yourself [lah] you are amazing
(mm) (mm)
[oh] my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
an hour we should like start a podcast or something [lah] it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also [lah] <malay>dah lama kita tak jumpa</malay> [kan] and and it's like so good to to finally you know
[eh] ya [oh] my god I almost forgot about our #makisan#
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
you know <malay>kat belakang</malay> and not at the front so
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging
!wow! if I were to start with mine we need another one more hour
love life <malay>aku boleh</malay> like you can literally write a book out of it man
[oh] my god
my nonsense my <malay>lain</malay> my love life <malay>lain</malay>
