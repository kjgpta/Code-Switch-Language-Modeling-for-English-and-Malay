okay testing
okay [lah] can [lah]
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of (um) hitting the red waves
yeah
[ah] but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements [ah]
take this as a the centre marking [ah]
so how was your prep
<malay>tadi lambat lagi</malay> [oh]
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like [ah] (um) what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but what what was the instructor's comments
(mm)
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money [ah]
it's the same bike
(mm)
E brake [eh]
<malay>hujung sini punya</malay> side [ah]
[oh] okay okay ya [ha] ya it's there [ah] okay wait it was on the straight road
[oh] corner <malay>yang</malay> third corner
ya there's one mirror there
ya
(mm)
<malay>takde bunyi</malay>
behind [ah]
[oh] okay
secluded [ah]
okay
(um)
of course [lah]
<malay>mana boleh</malay>
wait you went you you stop to help her
[oh] the instructor went to help her
ya [lah] I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
[oh] she
ya correct ya
(mm)
(mm)
what so she crashed into the wall
skid [ah]
by point of time you stop [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
kill switch
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>siapa</malay> number one
[oh] you get you got number one [ah]
(mm)
bandana
<malay>ada muka macam mat salleh sikit takde</malay> [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
the other side [ah]
then
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
but he was in charge of your class [ah]
prac one also [lah]
[oh] okay
(hmm)
no [lah] maybe maybe they they want you to practise more [ah] before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no [lah] some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
[eh] <malay>kau jangan cakap pasal</malay> two B
people who are riding class <malay>tu</malay> steady <malay>jatuh</malay> plank I have issues with plank I cannot hit the timing
class two ten seconds
!huh! class two class two class two ten second slower with a heavy bike <malay>aku punya</malay> timing <malay>selalu</malay> nine point seven nine nine point eight <malay>habis kat aku kena</malay> four points <malay>aku</malay> short [siol]
seven seconds is fast [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> class <malay>tu</malay> you have to go ten second <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh]
okay [lah] I mean with practice you can [ah]
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already [ha]
gear gear one <malay>kau boleh</malay> reach thirty
<malay>kalau kau</malay> whack [ah]
<malay>ini kau</malay> vroom <malay>dah pergi</malay> [siol]
that's how fast a class two bike is [ah]
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly [ah]
highly harly can bobber [ah] you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive [lah] [sia] (uh) I I I tested the bike (um)
I think last year during (uh)
wicked wallop <malay>tu dia orang baru</malay> just started (um) this company called mutt motorcycles [lah] I mean it's it's quite a renown brand in in their own country but it's new in singapore
so when they they they open up their their booth
a lot of interested <malay>punya</malay>
people [lah] so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay> two fifty like what's the purpose of you riding a two fifty [kan] either three hundred or four hundred [lah] [kan]
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean the the bike is
whatever what you see is what you get [lah]
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
the only ones that I know is vicious cycle <malay>ada satu dekat</malay> woodlands
(uh) #sanju#
#kaki bukit# #sanfu# #sanfu#
(uh) and I think the
ya and they have a showroom <malay>dekat</malay> #paya lebar#
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven [ah] seventeen K
[eh] sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
inclusive of [ah] back then that was last year <malay>punya</malay> so imagine with this year's
four K
four plus [ah]
expensive [ah]
definitely way cheaper [lah] I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean (uh) zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike [ah] brixton
but of course [lah] mutt is mutt is
I mean way better [lah]
<malay>aku</malay> actually try <malay>apa</malay> when I went to wicked wallop <malay>aku tanya dia</malay>
[eh] (um) if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
[oh] I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
(uh) brixton is is is a europe bike [ah]
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
then <malay>bila aku fikir-fikir balik</malay> (uh) forget it [ah] I'm taking my class two
waste <malay>duit</malay> [sial] <malay>nanti dah beli lepas tu aku dapat</malay> class two upgrade <malay>lagi</malay> don't want [ah]
but my wife tell me [ah] cause I keep falling <malay>apa</malay> I keep failing my class two and then every single time I take my class two prac
<malay>aku jatuh</malay>
my wife <malay>cakap</malay>
(um)
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money [ah]
you upgrade
(mm)
[ah] [lah] of course [lah] of course [lah]
no [lah] I mean I'm looking at my options
why [ah]
ya but super four is (uh) quite reliable bike [ah]
it is
ya no problem
ya but theirs they they it's not four hundred yes it's five hundred [eh] I mean because of singapore <malay>punya</malay> (uh) limitations and stuff so they
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> two A [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> higher [lah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
but the one thing about super four
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> their maintenance
it's freaking expensive [ah] [sial]
for a normal two B bike [ah] okay at the max you can go is one and a half engine oil bottles I mean we don't we don't talk about class two bikes [ah] class two <malay>memang</malay> of course [lah] the maintenance the servicing is going to cost you a bomb talking about standard two A bikes or two B bikes
my my bike one bottle that means one litre [lah] so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no [lah] one month [ah] I mean right now COVID one month [ah]
back then [eh] no [lah] back then when I was working in (uh)
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
to and fro [ah] twenty eight <malay>pergi</malay> twenty eight <malay>balik</malay>
fifty six [lah] <malay>kau masuk sikit-sikit</malay> if you know <malay>jalan jauh sikit</malay> then sixty [ah]
that it took me about one month [ah] to to to reach two click two thousand click
!walao! if two weeks two weeks <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] [sia] ya [lah] ya ya
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need [ah]
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay [lah] harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
!siala! <malay>kau</malay> imagine
four bottles of okay [lah] let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
(uh) quality <malay>punya</malay> engine oil okay [lah] basic [ah] ya basic motul [ah]
motul (uh) ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs [ah]
[eh] <malay>kau jangan cakap pasal</malay> iridium spark plugs [ah]
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's about what forty eight plus hundred bucks hundred and forty eight dollars that is just every one month monthly <malay>punya</malay> servicing you know
then <malay>tak termasuk kau punya tayar kau punya</malay> wear and tear <malay>kau punya</malay> brake pad
<malay>kau punya</malay> coolant super four <malay>ada</malay> coolant [kan]
that's why [lah] I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] I'm I'm too short [ah]
like what
three ten is quite big [ah] [sia] <malay>aku dah</malay>
is it
it's nice [lah] I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
it's it's a cafe racer <malay>punya</malay> model [eh]
capacity
(mm)
[oh]
ya [lah] and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper [ah]
no the furthest I went with this bike was (um) #desaru#
the furthest I went with my was (uh) #muar#
ya ya [lah]
(um)
three hundred it depends on where you are if I think about six hundred <malay>ke</malay> four five hundred <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] but
I've heard my I mean my friends [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> case <malay>dah</malay> on the [eh] <malay>dah dah pergi</malay> on the way <malay>balik</malay> piston jammed piston seize
tow [ah]
if <malay>dia orang</malay> if <malay>kena</malay> those people <malay>yang sengkek</malay> those who don't have money
they will go for the
the dangerous way [ah]
which is to <malay>tolak</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tahu tolak macam mana</malay> [kan]
this one I I never tried [ah] I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you [ah]
so you've lift down your foot rest
your <malay>dia punya</malay> pillion foot rest
my left leg
will <malay>tolak</malay> your bike I will I will use my bike <malay>punya</malay>
(uh) power to push together
[ah]
[ha] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] I've seen on the road [sia] serious I've seen it on the road [eh] <malay>au tak pernah nampak</malay> [eh] <malay>ni</malay> I've seen it on the road so that one if if you get caught by in singapore both revoke
but I mean malaysia <malay>dia orang kisah apa</malay>
[eh]
don't talk about #negeri sembilan# benny <malay>yang</malay> deliver <malay>dulu</malay>
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders [ah]
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
<malay>dia keluarkan</malay> so his was under run in running in
so technically his engine <malay>dah baru tukar</malay> overhaul [lah]
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or (uh) a new overhauled engine
(um)
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
ya so your has to be less than seven [ha] <malay>jaga</malay> correct
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike [lah]
so this guy
<malay>dia sorang</malay> two B
the rest was all two A class two no <malay>dia ikut</malay> [siol] he was going at one twenty !wah! <malay>pergi boleh pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>pergi</malay> happy happy
<malay>main</malay> go cart <malay>balik</malay> piston jammed piston <malay>pupus</malay> [ah]
benny <malay>tolak</malay> [ah] benny then swap [ah] <malay>tukar-tukar</malay>
that was from #malacca# to <malay>dia orang tolak</malay>
no [lah] [sial] they were going a hundred plus <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [sial]
I mean the person <malay>yang motor mati tu</malay> was just relax [jer] [ah]
steer [lah] but if <malay>kalau kau kena</malay> those sticky situations [ah]
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
<malay>kereta kat depan</malay>
jammed brake
<malay>kau tengah tolak</malay> [siol]
brake brake [ah] <malay>habis kalau</malay> case <malay>yang</malay> I don't know [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] because <malay>kau punya motor mati kau tak boleh</malay> engine break <malay>kau nak</malay> clutch in <malay>tak boleh</malay> clutch in <malay>tak boleh</malay> gear down
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral [lah]
<malay>kau tak pernah tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>ni</malay>
speaking of bike accidents
(uh) my father's friend [ah]
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga</malay> [ah]
<malay>dia bawa yang apa</malay> wolf [eh] wolf
eagle is it
I don't know [ah] it's a it's an old bike [lah] <malay>aku rasa sekarang pun dah tak ada</malay>
and then I think he was riding an
and then <malay>ada</malay> <malay>dua ke apa</malay> I can't remember [ah]
so they went to #pasir gudang# to to track [ah] <malay>main</malay> track
so <malay>dia orang nak main</malay> [ah] <malay>kira dah puas</malay>
<malay>balik punya</malay> time
<malay>dah sampai</malay> singapore
so one of the one of the friend <malay>dia tengah</malay> pillion <malay>orang</malay>
pillion <malay>tidur</malay>
he was sleeping and then of course [lah] #pasir gudang# quite far [lah] <malay>kau nak main</malay> track <malay>semua</malay> it's it's quite tiring [ah]
so this the rider
<malay>dia tak tahu</malay> [tau] the pillion was sleeping
he went to <malay>selit</malay> in between truck two trucks of course <malay>kau punya kau</malay> wobbly [ah] the pillion <malay>jatuh masuk dalam lori</malay> [siol]
my father witnessed his friend died [lah] [sia]
guy <malay>dia dia punya</malay> parents all like blame whoever it was there [lah] [sia] members [ah] <malay>kira</malay> [eh] <malay>jom</malay> [ah] <malay>kita main</malay> track you know that kind of thing [dah] happy happy <malay>balik mati</malay>
<malay>bujang</malay> [ah]
<malay>cakap pasal</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) accidents sean
sean sean sean fan sean fan [ha] liner he used to have two B [what] he also witnessed his friend died (um) they all going to <malay>tu dia pun mat rempit juga</malay> [ah] <malay>bawa</malay>

before this guy died [ah] he told me [lah] then he was very different
<malay>dia dah minta maaf dekat semua orang</malay>
[eh] you know forgive me [ah] if I ever sinned towards you [ah]
so on that day they went to
I think this guy <malay>tertidur ke apa entah</malay> either <malay>tertidur</malay> I don't know the full I forgot the full story he told me the story but I can't remember
but same case [ah] he went under the truck
<malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> shagged [ah]
<malay>habis kadang-kadang</malay> people will think [ah] then if I don't ride then whose my bike how
it's dangerous [ah]
[oh] speaking of dangerous riding [kan] I think one of their simulation lessons [kan]
they will simulate
you drunk
and how is it gonna look like [oh] you you <malay>belum lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>belum pergi</malay> [eh]
but it's damn stupid [ah] [sial]
no pass no fail
so you riding so the thing was like <malay>gini gini gini</malay>
is just car just swerve in front of you
<malay>aku</malay> brake <malay>tak makan</malay> [sia] brake <malay>tak makan langgar</malay> [ah] error you have met into an accident <malay>kepala otak</malay>
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar

it's just stupid
your leg on your bike [ah]
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
<malay>tapi</malay> when (uh)
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
<malay>kau kena</malay> watch out
(um) because <malay>dia punya</malay> platform so you have to climb up this platform and the bike is there so ya three screens
so <malay>dia punya</malay> the foot rest and the platform so the motor <malay>boleh gini</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kalau kau terpijak</malay> on the wrong platform <malay>kau boleh jatuh</malay> gear <malay>kau boleh jatuh</malay> [sial] <malay>kau macam</malay> lost balance [ah] if your if your <malay>kalau kau</malay> if you have slow reaction then you'll fall [lah]
but <malay>kalau kau jatuh tinggi</malay> [sial] <malay>tu</malay> platform
can
look <malay>benda tu</malay> like imagine the bike <malay>dia dia kira sebab</malay> bike <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>gitu tapi</malay> the bike won't fall
but you will hold the bike [ah] no need no need no need
<malay>tapi</malay> the the car simulation <malay>dia punya</malay> instructor
