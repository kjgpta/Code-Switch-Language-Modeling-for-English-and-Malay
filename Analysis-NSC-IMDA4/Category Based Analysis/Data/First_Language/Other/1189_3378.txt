[oh] <malay>betul tu</malay>
[oh] ya [hor] [eh] but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says (err) (um)

it's like chicken chicken and all
okay [lah] ya I mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy <malay>macam</malay> chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap [sia]
so one is for one dollar
it's I would say the a normal chicken is like <malay>macam</malay> you go to #jinjja# chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or [ah] it's that one [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like <malay>macam</malay> got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone [lah] got a lot of different flavour [ah] like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
we never go at there maybe we can go there [lor] check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces !wah! #shiok# [sia]
actually we can two person share one [what] one person six piece six dollars okay [sia] right
ya so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather #sedap# mania [ah] #sedap# mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right <malay>kalau</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> then this price <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kuning</malay> the other price right colour <malay>hijau</malay> do you remember because colour <malay>hijau</malay> is the cheapest [mah] right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
[oh] sounds yummy ya okay <malay>apa</malay>

<malay>baik</malay> #satay# sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
#satay# sauce soup base I was like !wah! that's kind of cool then maybe we can
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tengah</malay> diet

cheat day yes <malay>betul tu</malay> cheat day
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>tak tahu kejap</malay> I <malay>tanya adik</malay> I adam
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>mata tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> B B nine
(err) <malay>bukan bukan bukan</malay>
ya <malay>bukan</malay>
so okay <malay>kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni</malay> [eh] <malay>mari kita</malay>
[ah] <malay>nak cakap pasal orang tak</malay>
<malay>nak cakap tentang apa</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh gitu</malay> [eh]
<malay>orang kasih</malay> assignment <malay>kita mengumpat</malay>
okay okay ya alright <malay>kita jadi</malay> serious (um) <malay>apa kita nak berbual</malay> [eh] (um)
<malay>kita boleh cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita punya keluarga</malay> or okay no [lah] no [lah] [ah] shares [lah] stock market [lah] [eh]
so (um) you <malay>ada</malay> any investment you you <malay>dah buat ke</malay> or anything you <malay>nak</malay> recommend
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
me ya
I I also don't know [lah] I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> because <malay>sekarang nak beli</malay> tesla <malay>mahal tak mampu</malay> though
so
I think <malay>kalau</malay> I I will <malay>beli</malay> the stock (uh) for what I have now [lah] my capital <malay>yang ada</malay> I would probably invest in cheaper stocks [lah] singapore based stocks like
(uh) old #chang kee# for example (err) <malay>murah</malay> [jer] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> old #chang kee# <malay>dia punya</malay> share price is (err) <malay>enam puluh satu sen saje</malay> [tau] [ah] serious [a'ah] <malay>betul tu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada macam seratus ke dua ratus</malay> dollar then you <malay>akan</malay>
hold a lot of shares [tau] so I think
<malay>berbaloi</malay> [lah] then I I I mean [ah] I was looking at their annual report then old #chang kee# [kan]
<malay>dia orang akan</malay> open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like <malay>macam</malay> the demand for asian foods are rising <malay>tapi</malay> supply <malay>tak banyak</malay>
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region [kan] then <malay>agaknya</malay> I would think [lah] it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like (um) they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend [lah] so I mean that's my thing [lah] cause <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I I <malay>boleh mampu</malay> [lah] tesla <malay>mahal saje</malay>
ya <malay>tapi itu</malay> my thing [lah] on stocks
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> some some stocks <malay>dia orang tak</malay> how to say <malay>dia orang tak syariah</malay> on client [tau] so <malay>nanti dia orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh ambil dia punya</malay> (um) benefits [lah] from that stocks so ya I don't know [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua</malay> islamic financial [ah] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it [lah] that time I went for this (uh) website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get <malay>syariah pampasan</malay> or not
so it's very interesting because <malay>macam</malay> they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's (uh) allowed or not <malay>haram</malay> or halal [lah] in that sense <malay>tapi</malay> the problem with that website [ah] they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you <malay>kena bayar</malay>
then I'm like !alamak! then you muslim <malay>pun nak buat duit</malay>
<malay>nak tengok</malay> stocks halal <malay>ke tak</malay>
but I would say it's good [lah] like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very <malay>macam</malay> you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay [lah] that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
ya I think <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>kita sekarang</malay> (err) I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive [lah]
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
so ya <malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay>
ya (um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
good <malay>tak</malay> stocks
(mm)
I see I see
ya anyway (err) <malay>betul tu</malay> ya but I heard [kan] <malay>itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak pakai wahed</malay> invest then
<malay>ada</malay> some fees involved right like <malay>apa tu</malay>
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
(um) okay <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak bilang</malay> you [oh] ya anyway I I found out there is days
new (um) way
technically grow your money but with very low return [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you <malay>tak nak letak</malay> it in the bank [lah]
because firstly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the <malay>hibah tak banyak</malay>
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new <malay>saham</malay> returns <malay>tapi tak banyak</malay> the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> it's like a savings account with a little bit more (uh)
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
so
wasted [lah] I think like a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal
so
ya [lah] wasted <malay>kalau dia orang tak</malay> invest in bonds then <malay>kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam</malay> [seh] if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
right [kan]
can [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> I call <malay>dia orang</malay>
ya [lah] I call [lah] I call [lah] I <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay> right
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
for the idea of islamic finance because technically (um) you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also <malay>macam</malay> in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
that's why I think (err)
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore <malay>macam</malay> not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
interest yielding accounts and maybe <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> [lah] it's <malay>haram</malay> because you would need to kind of know [mah] <malay>yang kita tak boleh yang</malay> interest and all bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya <malay>kita terus</malay> deep [eh] <malay>berbual</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> I was looking at (um) the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting [lah] because (uh) one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are (err) they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
SOCOE will be a good <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun macam tak faham sangat</malay> [lah] how how the SOCOE (um) investment works but halal [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] so <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [eh]
ya so
ya
[oh] <malay>kita punya</malay> trip [eh] [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I I <malay>punya adik kejap</malay> [eh] I call my <malay>adik</malay> hello
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>baru kentut adik</malay> I <malay>kentut adik</malay> I <malay>lepas ni nak kena</malay>
<malay>bau dia kuat</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu dia punya ada</malay> like a mix of a and I don't know <malay>dia makan apa tapi bau dia</malay> like one kind you know toxic toxic
<malay>kentut</malay> [ah] I think maybe yes [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> eating [lah] agaknya rasa gitu</malay> [ah]
so (um)
ya ya <malay>itu</malay> I I I <malay>tu tak</malay> okay [ha] [ha] so anyway (um)
<malay>nak pergi makan</malay> I <malay>pun lapar sekarang belum makan</malay> so I <malay>pun nak pergi makan</malay> actually [kan] is #hafizah# going or not to #sedap# mania like what what do you think the chances are
(mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lor] actually <malay>semua pun dah</malay> agree <malay>apa</malay> sunday <malay>semua</malay> okay
!aiyo! unless <malay>kita</malay> just go somewhere to like <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
then after that we just <malay>lepak</malay> then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
I would think maybe #seletar# cafe will be good <malay>tapi sana makanan dia</malay> <malay>tak</malay> halal so <malay>mana kita boleh makan</malay> [oh] maybe we can eat at #seletar# airport the mister <malay>teh tarik</malay> express <malay>dia tu mahal ke</malay>
okay (um)
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> what are good things for us to <malay>makan</malay> [eh] (err)
I okay
okay [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan</malay> I <malay>punya adik</malay> [lah] <malay>mana kita nak pergi</malay>

<malay>apa seorang</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay> or rather act a bit <malay>pelik</malay> you know
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
maybe <malay>dia punya anak</malay> needs treatment [lah] like like do you think so
[oh] mother's gossip
[a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] however <malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul tu</malay> maybe what we can do is we can actually find this (um) Q your distant relative we can <malay>ajak</malay> her [lah] go <malay>makan</malay> [oh] maybe #sedap# mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
<malay>banyak banyak banyak banyak</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> so
<malay>lagi</malay> more reason [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true [lah] if someone is put in that environment they kind of <malay>macam</malay> angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you <malay>takde</malay> you know outlet <malay>boleh keluarkan</malay> the <malay>perasaan</malay>
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally [lah] [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> her [eh] I [tau] eat him or her up like internally
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
(mm) [ah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay>
[ah] ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]
[ah] #sentosa# is it
that's how [ah] we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
(um) #sentosa# I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump <malay>itu</malay> I <malay>tak berani</malay>
so (um) #sentosa# maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar [ah]
you know we can just hang around at #sentosa# #sentosa# I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts [lor]
[ah] yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort #serapong# can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
tramp <malay>punya</malay> trail then we just <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
you cannot claim compensation [lah] because it's at your own risk [mah] you <malay>masuk tempat gitu</malay> so
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good [lah] cause <malay>kalau kalau tak</malay> then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]
I'm not too sure I really don't
[oh] ya we can do that also (uh) I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
(err) (um) can [lah] I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
can also then luge <malay>macam laju</malay> [lah] a bit too fast don't you think so
