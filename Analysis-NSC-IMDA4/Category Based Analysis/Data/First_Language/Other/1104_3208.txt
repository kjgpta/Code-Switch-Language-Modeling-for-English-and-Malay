hello <malay>mas apa khabar</malay>
I'm fine thank you
how's your family
[ah]
ya second one is a boy right
[oh] I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
it's okay <malay>macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana</malay> (mm) so what are your plans for this weekend
[oh]
(uh) I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it (um) you might know them because some of them are our former [ah] schoolmates
[oh] yes #ahmad# is there (uh) <malay>dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada</malay> (uh) think four or five kids
no [lah] it's okay [ah] <malay>rezeki masing-masing</malay> [ah] so are you not going out with your family today
[oh] you're into baking now !wah! that's nice !wah! must try some of your cake soon [ah]
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
[ah] movie but [ah] during this pandemic kind of hard [lah] because I think with the crowd control and all
!wah! netflix and chill [ah]
(err) I don't know (uh) only so far only a few have confirmed but (uh)
I will update you [ah] on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can [lah] (uh)
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
[ah]
(um) but is it too young for them to start
(um) going to tuition at this age she's only six years old [kan]
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that (err) everyone is competing (uh) so
it's
it has its pros and cons [ah] like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
ya but
slowly [lah] but surely (uh) I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important [lah] they just try their best [lah]
and
I I do have other maybe (uh) I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
[oh] [oh]
[orh] okay okay I understand I can ask for you [lah] then
(err) we'll see what we can arrange
(err)
!wah! you sit down at coffeeshop [ah] I thought you #atas# [one]
[oh] you you full time housewife [ah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tu boleh jaga anak-anak</malay>
good [lah]
actually it's better for to me [lah] personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
(um) like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore (err) I think (err)
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive [ah] then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day (uh) some owners also like abuse their maid [lah] so that's not right [lah] I feel
ya there's (uh) the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse [ah] think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news [lah] but you just have to be updated [lah] now with the
COVID nineteen [ah] I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that [lah] before they are cleared to do cleaning [oh] (mm)
<malay>bagus</malay> [seh] <malay>masak untuk</malay> husband all
[oh] must take care of your health now [lah]
like but I think if now if you go to any
(uh) I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya [lah] for those who are working [lah] they will give you like
to check on yourself
(err) so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ya but <malay>ni adalah satu</malay> (uh) precaution for us to take ya so <malay>kita perlu berhati-hati</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so <malay>penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah</malay> [jer]
(uh) #alhamdulilah# so far
I'm okay [lah] maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest (uh) because of work [ah]
ya [lah] stress [lah] at work <malay>macam-macam</malay>
(um) politic [lah] then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what (uh)
safety measure measurement at work (mm) cause yes
now currently we have this installation (uh) of #doraemon# at the national museum it's interesting [lah] but
since it's the holidays [kan] <malay>banyak orang-orang datang</malay> (uh) visit museum
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak datang dengan</malay> family <malay>nak kena datang</malay> on weekdays
(uh) weekend <malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal terlalu ramai</malay>
(uh) until <malay>nak</malay> queue under the hot sun <malay>pengsan pula</malay>
(um) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>semua kena</malay> queue <malay>macam biasa</malay>
unless I'm there [lah] then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ya so ya [lah] kind of sad <malay>pasal tengah</malay> holiday <malay>sekarang</malay> but we have nowhere to go
[ah]
[oh] ya ya I've read about it but <malay>belum ada</malay> time [lah] to redeem tour voucher
(uh)
[oh] I don't think <malay>ada</malay>
for kids <malay>ada tu</malay> vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
(uh) claim it
online [ah] so it's not that bad [lah] hundred dollars <malay>pun jadi</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>biasa</malay> [lah] singaporean <malay>bila yang dia orang tak</malay> complain
[oh] usually you go to #johor# [ah] and do your shopping
(mm) understand ya I think (uh) COVID nineteen <malay>ni menjejas banyak</malay> singaporean
then ya [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday <malay>pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu</malay> [lah]
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so <malay>pasal</malay> I think malaysia <malay>pun sekarang masih ada banyak</malay> case [ah] so it's still unstable [lah]
I think so far our government has done well [lah] to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
(mm)
[oh]
I think (uh) ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also <malay>ada bilang juga</malay>
[ah] so it's like
(uh) they have different sizes [lah] and
(uh) they cater also for kids
(mm)
[ah] no [lah] I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask <malay>pun</malay> can do its job [lah]
(mm)
ya true
ya [lah] <malay>sekarang pun yang baru-baru</malay> case <malay>dekat</malay> tampines mall <malay>tu</malay> !wah!
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall <malay>terperanjat</malay> [seh]
ya
ya but surprisingly
(uh) so far <malay>tak ada pula</malay> case <malay>yang lain-lain</malay>
I mean <malay>yang</malay> in the community [lah]
I think they are currently
preparing [ah] for phase three to roll out but ya [lah] depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert [lah] it's important [lah] for us to be on alert
[ah] because you will never know [seh] who <malay>yang ada penyakit ni</malay> then <malay>kita pun senang jangkit</malay> especially <malay>dengan macam</malay>
<malay>warga emas dengan kita punya</malay> parents <malay>nak kena jaga-jaga</malay>
ya I think <malay>baru semalam</malay> news (uh) that people are queuing over at <malay>mana</malay> [eh]
[ah] foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
in place [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] from the look of the photos <malay>tak ada</malay> [jer] think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
(mm)
ya [lah] that's where the christmas light up is <malay>lagi</malay> so this year has been a challenging year [lah] [ah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>ada bagus juga</malay> [lah] that you
<malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to <malay>ke</malay> malaysia <malay>ke</malay> I think it's affecting business everywhere (uh) <malay>kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian</malay> [kan]
I think (mm) <malay>mana-mana</malay> affected
you know
(mm) ya [lah] but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> are required to have the mandatory swab test then (uh) like
stay home notice ya
and I think (uh) for those who are coming in I think
(uh) they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure [ah] I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required [lah] [eh] even when they come in they have to do the swab test [lah]
[ah]
ya thankfully
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] so I I <malay>dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena</malay> swab test <malay>yang</malay>
(uh) <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau dibuat dengan betul tak</malay> [lah] <malay>rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru</malay> or trainee <malay>yang buat</malay> !wah! <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali</malay>
a
(mm) yes yes
(uh) I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the (uh) the conduct the test
ya I think I even my friend <malay>yang</malay>
was (mm) asked to leave I think he got a job as a security [lah] (err) and considered is also a high risk because (err) he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm (uh)
but actually they're paying quite
high [lah] is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that [lah] because they don't want to
be in contact [ah] ya don't want to be exposed to this (uh) and even when he he's finished his job think he ask (uh) his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can (uh) remove his clothes outside his house (uh) ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace [lah] so it's just an
additional steps [ah] precaution ya
[ah]
ya you see
ya actually quite <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] in this situation <malay>macam banyak orang ada</malay> family but
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> business <malay>tutup</malay>
[ah] so it's not easy [ah] it's quite
twenty twenty has been (uh) ya [lah] like I said a challenge [lah] <malay>untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan</malay> [lah]
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
measure steps [ah] I think which is quite good [lah] for all [lah] even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted <malay>tak boleh keluar ke apa</malay> but still it's for our own good [lah]
[oh] I do actually (err) I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like [ah] so he and his wife <malay>dah beli</malay>
a few cartons [eh] I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe [lah]
got some quality is not that good [ah]
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask [ah]
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but I don't know how <malay>berapa bagus yang</malay> reusable <malay>punya</malay> mask
ya but
no [lah] I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last [lah] (err) for a few months then but you have to
wash [lah] I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] because (uh)
<malay>bulan</malay> december (err) think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe <malay>nak ajak makan</malay> [lah] but
(err) according to the
safety measurement I think
!wah! only can <malay>keluar</malay> (um) five <malay>lima orang sahaja</malay>
(mm)
ya can okay [lah] that's an idea but
think <malay>kalau</malay> the atmosphere is different [lah] when you dining outside (err) <malay>dengan makan kat rumah</malay> [kan]
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
take care of ourselves [lah] think the celebration is is actually <malay>pasal kita nak kena</malay>
<malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
<malay>janji kita sihat</malay>
(mm) <malay>mana kita berhenti tadi</malay>
(um) [ah] <malay>awak</malay>
<malay>seorang</malay> baker <malay>awak suka masak apa</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> family
(mm)
<malay>pandai juga awak</malay> baking [eh] <malay>abeh kalau masak masak apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>untuk</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>suami awak</malay> family <malay>awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay>
(mm) <malay>mungkin pasal orang dah</malay> stock up <malay>ke</malay> (uh) <malay>iya</malay> [lah] singaporean [kan] <malay>macam saya cakap</malay> #kiasu# <malay>dia orang suka benar simpan</malay>
[oh] <malay>beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi</malay> (uh) three or four packets for a family of
[ah] three [kan] (mm)
ya [lah] <malay>kesian yang orang-orang yang ya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada pendapatan</malay> (mm) <malay>tapi saya rasa</malay> <malay>ada juga</malay> restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
(mm) ya [lah] <malay>saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang pergi</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay> (uh) there's a lot of platform <malay>yang</malay> go digital so I think (uh) everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop [ah] these are now necessities
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya I think (uh) a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can [lah] so it's best they do so [lah] during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected [seh] ya I think my friends either <malay>yang kena</malay> retrenched at an early age [eh]
feels also quite sad [lah] for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something [ah] but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad [lah] but it's better than not having no job and all [lah] ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya [lah]
ya [lah] it's tiring [lah] even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now (uh) doing grab but grab is also affected (err) think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he (uh) took back the car ya but still it's not doing well [lah] he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental (uh)
ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
I think <malay>dia tak akan</malay> take the swabber paying job [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I think he has more kids at home <malay>kesian takut</malay> he'll be affected [lah] even though he'll be (uh) think
he has his reasons [lah] for not doing that kind even though it's (uh) <malay>gaji tinggi</malay> but still <malay>dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan</malay> (uh)
to the family [lah]
(mm) true [lah] I think
the government implementing a lot of (err) help for those
need them [ah] they also I think they have set up this (um) united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need [lah] ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march [ah] I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya [lah] things will get better [lah] think I think for singaporean [ah] they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases [ah] that can affect us
ya where should we go to <malay>makan</malay> what is your favourite food
#prata#
(uh) there's a #prata# at #sin ming# I think it's quite nice it's run by a family (uh) father and a son
can can (um)
can [ah] maybe I want to try eat the #briyani# [ah]
the #briyani# is quite nice [ah] I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best [ah]
(err) what do you want to order I help you order
the #briyani# or the #prata# coin is also nice
yes the curry is (uh) <malay>sedap</malay>
and it's
<malay>tak pedas sangat</malay>
I think just the right
taste [ah]
can
(uh) I think I eat #briyani# with (uh) fried chicken [lah] (mm) because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking [ah]
then what drinks do you want
#teh# #peng# #teh# #peng#
#teh# with ice [eh]
ya but I think is not that good to always drink #teh# with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better [lah] at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health (err) and also see what eat we eat
[ah] and also see what we eat
okay
can
(uh)
anything else
!wah! there's a lot of people in the queue

[oh] so we have to pick up or
[oh] okay [oh] that's
!wah! see <malay>sekarang semua dah</malay> high tech
order <malay>makan pun boleh</malay>
ya I understand but (err) I volunteered with (err) an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food (err) to buy groceries so that they will minimize (err) their movement outside [ah] so they can actually (err) contact us and have like medication
(uh) you can buy for them and then send it to their homes (um)
ya [lah] I think it's a long way to help our seniors (uh)
because I think if they are exposed to this I think (um) probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is (uh) I think done by government agencies [ah] they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors (uh) so that they will not be exposed much [ah] so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies [ah] then we will be there to send groceries medication (uh) food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer [lah] through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask [eh] for more information [lah] ya
ya at this point <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's not
(um)
not right to be walking on their own <malay>tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> I think it will take <malay>masa yang panjang untuk dia orang</malay> to recover to get well [ah] <malay>kesian</malay> I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
free [ah]
(mm) <malay>betul tu abeh lagi</malay> cause my parents are staying on their own <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] we don't get to meet them as much <malay>abeh ada</malay> some old folks <malay>tak tahu pakai</malay> smartphone so <malay>lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu</malay> so <malay>kesian dia orang</malay> so <malay>masa-masa gini</malay> [lah] <malay>kita patut berwaspada</malay> even though it's sad but we have to follow [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] <malay>yang generasi yang</malay>
<malay>lama mereka tak</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> internet <malay>macam kita sekarang</malay> so with this technology I think <malay>dia orang</malay> will
[ah] <malay>ambil masa untuk</malay>
<malay>mempelajari semua abeh kalau kita</malay>
<malay>tak ada di sana</malay>
<malay>makin susah</malay>
so <malay>kesian</malay> so
communication
is
<malay>macam makin kurang</malay> and there's less interaction human interaction
ya [lah] <malay>tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia</malay> and <malay>dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh</malay>
<malay>nak dia orang bersama kita</malay>
(mm) actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones [lah] <malay>yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
data
(mm)
that's why it's (uh) important [lah] to <malay>untuk mereka</malay> (um) update <malay>dengan</malay> keep with the trend <malay>apa yang berlaku bukan jadi</malay> trendy [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> keep up with the times
<malay>mungkin juga</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga</malay> so <malay>mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat</malay>
(um) <malay>balik semula kehidupan yang</malay> normal
[oh] the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort [ah] to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal [ah]
some <malay>dan hari raya</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm) (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> contact is now minimal [lah] (mm)
<malay>sedih</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam mana</malay>
<malay>kita harus mengikut peraturan</malay>
<malay>mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan</malay> [lah] <malay>setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> singaporean usually <malay>kalau</malay> holiday <malay>akan</malay> go overseas (uh) (mm) holiday (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang tengah</malay>
<malay>keadaan begini semuanya</malay>
<malay>tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di</malay> singapore

<malay>harap bersabar sahaja</malay> [lah] <malay>kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua</malay>
(mm)

when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide [lah]
[ah]
[oh] <malay>itu</malay> safe distance ambassador
