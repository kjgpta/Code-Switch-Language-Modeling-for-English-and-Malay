[oh] it's okay (um) #jurong# and woodlands not very near also [what]
[oh] what bus was it [ah]
(oo) actually that's damn long [eh] I can't imagine like <malay>penat</malay> [eh] confirm
[ah] <malay>ada tempat duduk tak</malay>
(mm)
not bad I don't think I ever took one eight seven before [sia]
like the only bus I will take
to go #jurong# is [eh]
I don't know honestly I don't know
(um) yeah I mean I go to school like I study in #jurong# right okay technically not #jurong# [lah] #clementi#
but usually like I take and bus
but then there isn't like a direct bus to my school so that kind of sucks yeah
[ah] yeah correct I take the train from #marsiling#
to #clementi# then I take one eight four
yeah it's pretty tiring honestly everytime I sit I get so annoyed because like there's so many people on the bus and they're all just squeezing to get a seat (ugh)
yeah especially like before COVID right at least now with COVID everyone like social distance and the bus isn't so crowded right but like
before COVID [oh] my god it was a mess [eh] <malay>berapa banyak orang</malay> inside the bus
honestly like I also now everytime I went to school
I'm kind of glad now that it's not so crowded but I do hate the fact that COVID exists
<malay>macam macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
<malay>susah nak</malay> breathe right yeah that's why I don't like wearing the mask you know it's really so hard
I feel like [oh] it's just so tiring you take more energy trying to breathe then like
walking around or running around
yeah honestly like our friendship is damn low maintenance [ah] like we took
we haven't been out with each other in like what a year
like <malay>satu tahun</malay> that is so long you know
like honestly the last time we went out that was memorable was us going to LANY
and that was fun I'm quite upset that this year there's no more concerts
(um)
yeah <malay>itu pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> right it's so sad [seh] like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
all because of COVID is really damn irritating especially when it comes to like
school [oh] yeah you know I was supposed to go on a holiday in june to New Zealand
like dude that's one of the best countries
ever [eh] like honestly but we couldn't even go and the thing is
<malay>kita tak tahu</malay> [seh] whether next year you can go or not
!hey! loser
(mm)
same [oh] my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the <malay>paling</malay> best right is like when <malay>malam malam kita</malay> go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
[oh] my god I miss malaysia Ramly burger
yeah like the vibes at night is just different like last time [ah] when me and my dad
when we went there when me and my whole family used to go right then my dad will always go to this one particular guy his name was like #azan# or something
but his burgers <malay>sedap gila</malay> [oh] my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
we can't even go there and the thing is we don't even know if he still has a business which is so sad
<malay>kasihannya</malay>
<malay>kasihan</malay> [seh] like
some people like they their only form of income is like all these businesses
<malay>habis sekarang sebab</malay> COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
but honestly if you think about it right if I stay in malaysia I'll be having so much fun right now
because like malaysia is so big you can already travel from #jurong# #jurong# [eh]
#johor bahru# to and where can we go in singapore #jurong# to #tampines#
like what the heck so boring
!huh! <malay>tak</malay> best [seh]
I thought like the best part of living in malaysia would be because like you can go from one place to another
but that's not the case
(mm)
what
what so the police like
dress up as a <malay>pocong</malay> to scare them
(hmm)
actually that's quite <malay>kelakar</malay> [sia] like honestly can you imagine <malay>malam malam tengah</malay> drive
<malay>habis tiba tiba nampak pocong</malay> scary #wei# I also will turn around [seh] LOL
yeah honestly indonesians have the funniest humour from what I see on Twitter they always say like
when usually people have the worst humour like if somebody go to their house and scare them they would like laugh and stuff right
yeah honestly but when in singapore <malay>tak ada apa apa jadi punya</malay>
like it's like okay <malay>kalau keluar terus kena</malay> [ah] arrested
<malay>habis</malay> like <malay>dia orang semua</malay> like they have fun with it [ah] but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
cause the COVID situation is not so bad but I still miss school
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so <malay>penat</malay>
like (ugh) it's so hard to focus in class you know because it's all online
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress <malay>gila tahu</malay> honestly
it's like you would think that <malay>kalau belajar</malay> online <malay>lagi senang</malay> [kan] but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but I have one exam coming this thursday and I'm so scared cause I have barely studied
yeah I was thinking that exams would be online which would suck
but luckily for me <malay>tak</malay> it's like
you must go to campus but you have like a lot of precautions to follow you must like
key in your temperature like on the school website [lah] then like you must at the entrance you must show like this specific lanyard thing that you must have to enter the campus and all then [ah]
our exam <malay>dulu kat</malay> (um) like hall <malay>besar besar</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> it's all just in class
so it's like one class per classroom then the exam is there
then honestly to me like <malay>tak ada</malay> vibes [ah] like there's no
exam like seriousness of an exam so it's very hard for me to focus like I had an exam a few
like two weeks ago
and like honestly <malay>susah gila nak</malay> focus because like
I don't know just not used to it you know like wearing a mask and then it's just so uncomfortable
[ah] <malay>tak</malay> my exam is all written
for me [ah] yeah because
I don't know my course don't really have a lot to do with like online stuff or like
next sem we're going to have <malay>macam</malay> coding classes but this sem so far <malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
so honestly I cannot imagine having the exam on laptop cause I think that would be super stressful but
I don't know I guess you have to experience to know how is your O level preparation going
[eh] but I thought they extended <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
I I don't know if I read the article correctly I never really read [lah] I just saw the headlines it's like [eh] extended
[oh] right that's true [oh] I forgot okay anyway
best <malay>apa</malay> honestly I hated like
[ah] fun fact I dropped in sec three
cause I sucked at I was so bad at it
and the thing is it's ironic cause you know how they say malays can't do math right
yeah but then I did well for maths but I can't do well for which is damn funny honestly
actually that's true I wonder is like because all my friends right they say they are more motivated at home
so it's always I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I'm the only person <malay>yang</malay> cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
[oh] it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I <malay>tak rasa</malay> honestly
like for me like <malay>susah gila</malay> [lah] to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
and your school life is hard because you are in the same place [what] at least last time like
<malay>ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk</malay> like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
so hopefully the bell curve isn't higher only everyone is faces situation as you like the [oh] I cannot study I'm stress kind of thing
but I don't know I wouldn't want to go through O levels ever again
[oh] typical like <malay>mak melayu</malay> right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that <malay>bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama</malay> honestly I don't know
I always tell myself like [oh] I'm going to be better I really hope so
and like
yeah
!hais! I just want COVID to be over it has caused so many problems
hopefully
[oh] well yesterday [ah] like I said I always stay at home right so basically yesterday I was staying at home but mostly I was studying
(um)
since I'm so used to right I stopped writing physical notes
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like <malay>tulis</malay> notes and stuff
and like honestly I find that it helps me to be more productive
so in a way I think
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation <malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak sangat</malay> but
it did help me overall like
realise what studying methods help me more
so that's basically what I did yesterday how about you
(mm)
[a'ah]
(um) malayan council [eh] what you eat there
[oh] I only <malay>makan</malay> there like once before then I got try <malay>macam</malay> their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the <malay>rendang</malay>
honestly I don't know I haven't gone to like arab street in so long and I just like
I miss the atmosphere that it was before COVID you know
[oh] who did you <malay>makan</malay> [ah] malayan council with
[oh] man low key <malay>nak makan</malay> [seh]
like honestly but like you said <malay>mahal gila</malay> like I still remember the
first time we ever went we were like so surprised by the prices like
<malay>memang</malay> normal [lah] cafes in singapore all the food <malay>mahal</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like
malayan council legit like damn expensive but I think like
it's like quite serata</malay> yeah it's like the
price of the food and the taste of the food and the quality it's all matches up quite well [lah] it's just that
I don't know I just feel like it's a food that you eat every once in a while you know
no I've never tried before what does it (um) what does it [eh] what does it sell
!wow! that one sounds nice [eh] honestly I love Indomie
Indomie is so good must be you can't go wrong with Maggi so basically like indobowl just sells like
let's just say how to say high quality indomie is it
yeah I always <malay>sesat</malay> at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always <malay>sesat</malay>
but I think like recently I went there like
more often so now I think I won't get <malay>sesat</malay> as much hopefully
well honestly
I've been thinking of all these nice food to <malay>makan</malay> but guess what I can't <malay>makan</malay> cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same <malay>susah gila nak cari kerja</malay> serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
like I keep using this app called fast jobs and I like tried to find all these different different
(um) positions and the thing is they always say like [oh] urgent hiring
that kind of thing so like obviously <malay>semua orang</malay> apply <malay>apa</malay> [kan]
then <malay>bila</malay> apply then <malay>dia orang tak</malay> get back then <malay>macam tak faham</malay> [seh] like
you say that it's urgent you say that you need people but why do you like not get back to people I don't understand
I think I applied for over like what twenty jobs already and like most didn't get back to me
honestly my last few
like jobs that I've applied for was like Starbucks Coffee Bean like to be honest
I don't even know if I want to <malay>kerja</malay> at this kind of places cause honestly stress <malay>gila</malay>
like <malay>nanti ramai gila</malay> customers <malay>habis nanti</malay> got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
if I do get the job I get better at it you know that kind of thing how about you what kind of jobs did you apply for
like <malay>dia orang macam sengaja</malay> right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
they never properly advertise what will be in need for the job
then only when you contact them then they will be like [oh] you have to do this <malay>nak kena buat itu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena buat ini</malay> [lah]
I myself don't like it also
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like <malay>apa satu</malay>
<malay>satu ratus</malay>
like job postings and all but it's like okay
look through every single one I apply for like ten
then like all ten never get back to me like serious <malay>tak faham</malay> [seh]
why do you post the job if like you're not going to get back to people you know I know you're busy and all but the least you can do is like
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now <malay>macam</malay> COVID nineteen
time you think like <malay>senang</malay> [meh] <malay>cari kerja</malay>
(mm)
yeah like honestly the <malay>tunggu</malay> like <malay>untuk tunggu</malay> like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part [lah] honestly
it's like I applied for Bath and Body Works recently
then they said like we'll get back to you in a week if you're shortlisted
then like <malay>fikir fikir</malay> about it right it's like
why if I'm shortlisted what if I don't get the job can you at least tell me also because like
you say a week right then any time in between that week <malay>pun</malay> you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
but then it's just like really just waiting and waiting and waiting and obviously you don't want to like
make things harder for yourself by applying for other jobs or waiting for another job to get back to you
so I understand your frustration [lah] like do I apply for this
but like what if the other job accepts me then I cannot take this job
and then it will just make their lives harder
but they don't even think about us they don't even tell us
like honestly I would prefer getting a you're rejected letter rather than just like nothing at all you know
I rather like also know why I didn't get the job that kind of thing it would be nice to know
so that like you can improve yourself and stuff like that but
I don't know how the working world works cause I'm only eighteen but I guess we'll see in the future
hopefully honestly like during this like you know like circuit breaker period
I honestly ordered a lot of things online because like honestly I thought about it I thought like
okay once COVID ends I can get a job and my holidays start it will be so easy for me to like
pay back all the money that I wasted during the holidays
but no I got it all wrong I thought COVID
will end in a few months <malay>tapi tak</malay>
COVID is still here and it's like
!hais! all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can <malay>keluar</malay> but like barely <malay>pun</malay>
so it's like all these new clothes that I wear for what honestly
like I buy it for what I can't even like <malay>pakai</malay> to <malay>keluar</malay> and it's like so heart breaking
(mm) (mm)
yeah honestly like when the virus started in china I was like damn that is disgusting
I was thinking that [oh] they already contained it [what] like it was from #wuhan# and like they already closed up #wuhan# and everything and I thought that it wouldn't like suddenly
have this kind of spike and all then like when it <malay>terjadi macam terperanjat</malay> you know
like everything happened so fast like we were just living our life as per normal
we were like [oh] it's china's problem like <malay>kita semua ingat</malay> like [oh] china [jer] <malay>apa yang ada</malay> virus <malay>ni</malay>
like of course it won't hit singapore
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia <malay>tapi tak</malay> [seh]
like <malay>tiba tiba</malay> <malay>ada berapa banyak</malay> cases
<malay>sekarang [dah]</malay> like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly <malay>banyak gila</malay> and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
how to say ungrateful for their position they are the biggest they are like
one of the biggest country in the world but like
their management is so bad like look at their president it's a stupid idiot named donald trump
and honestly like <malay>dia</malay> serious <malay>tak guna</malay> [ah] honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like <malay>tak faham</malay> [seh] like
I understand wearing mask is <malay>susah</malay> [lah] but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also [what] right
(mm)
(hmm)
yeah but if you think about it <malay>macam kasihan</malay> [seh] <malay>orang orang kat</malay> because like in the end
you will look up your president [what] right
because technically like so many people voted him in to the office and all and like
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like <malay>baru</malay> to them right
then maybe they will just <malay>dengar</malay> what he say because in the end he's president [what] he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so <malay>kasihan</malay>
and it's like
the mayors even have to step in just to (uh) make up for his mistakes like he should know that as a president
he has a lot of power and like everything he says will be taken seriously right everybody no matter how dumb or stupid like they are
it's just like normal to listen to your president [what] because they are like the head like in power and all so yeah
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so <malay>merepek</malay> [sia] you think about it it's like
there are still people who are saying that they will vote him for the next election when he has already
proven so many times that he is inadequate for the country
like why you so dumb (ugh) anyway let's stop talking about this stupid idiot
[eh] guess who texted me
this guy from like okay okay so
so like you know I'm super bored during school and all
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday <malay>lepas tu habis</malay> [kan]
so then like I started using OkCupid
then like I talked to a bunch of guys [lah] because I think I'm quite pretty
then like this guy
he's not very honestly he's like (err) tall
then like okay [lah] like good looking not bad not bad you know
then he damn funny [sia] then he ask me like stupid stupid malay jokes okay okay wait let me tell you one malay joke

yeah it's stupid right but like he was one of the first few matches that like make me laugh you know
so he like <malay>macam</malay> like got my attention [ah] then like !wah! he not bad [sia] honestly
he's like eighteen years old which is my age honestly actually I don't really date guys my age [ah]
but <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] maybe this kind guy will be the exception [kan]
so like yeah honestly we clicked

but like I don't know he's not bad and he's tall okay [ah] not like
super super <malay>tinggi</malay> but like one seven five not bad right
(uh) yeah I'm thinking about #hudy# who is one six three that stupid idiot of a boy
honestly like I'm so upset that he kind of ghosted me
like okay [lah] I'm not like super upset about it [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> (um) <malay>macam sakit hati</malay> [ah] like because like
okay I wouldn't say that we were vibing but at least like I was talking to him and he was talking to me and it's just
he just double tick me <malay>sedih tahu</malay>

facts honestly but (um)
I don't know the guy so far okay [lah] I think everyone <malay>macam</malay>

and I really just want to go to malaysia I want to eat my korean barbeque
you got try before right the K Fry chicken <malay>sedap tak</malay>
[ah] [seh] honestly <malay>kita selalu pergi</malay> malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
three to one conversion rate
[ah] [seh] I just miss going there [lah] I remember like everytime we go we will try this place called dolly #dim sum# have you tried before
it's <malay>sedap gila</malay> like I don't even like #dim sum#
but they have the salted egg yolk #dim sum# and it's like

(mm)
yeah like <malay>dulu kita</malay> [kan] <malay>selalu pergi</malay> malaysia like my family will go to like
<malay>makan</malay> like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like <malay>makan makan makan</malay>
like <malay>kita</malay>
in one day I think we will <malay>makan</malay> at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like <malay>konon konon macam</malay> food tester [ah] try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best <malay>gila</malay> [seh] that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not <malay>halal</malay> in singapore is <malay>halal</malay> in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like <malay>kena makan</malay> pepper lunch
[oh] my god I love pepper lunch so much and I miss pepper lunch
yeah it was damn funny right it was like I think I texted you like we were texting right saying that we were also at the same place or something [oh] no

<malay>siapa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia boleh</malay> like <malay>terserempak</malay> in cause we are singaporeans right
best <malay>apa</malay> imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just !woo! spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
why I yeah you talking about wedding reminds me
I <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to <malay>makan nasi biryani</malay>
like honestly I just miss the wedding food and the atmosphere it's so fun like cause you know I'm in a mixed family right
so usually our wedding is like for the
[ah] like my mum
[ah] side she loves taking like she loves the indian culture
so it's like yeah we're not mixed per say
but like because like our ancestors like got some
some blood and all so like we also like proclaim [lah] but actually we're not mixed
full malay like you
but yeah basically <malay>macam</malay>
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat <malay>nasi biryani</malay> then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic <malay>nasi biryani</malay> cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on <malay>nasi briyani</malay> and all <malay>tapi tak</malay>
our weddings will always have like the nicest <malay>nasi biryani</malay> and honestly I just miss all that
I was so lucky that like my aunt she managed to get married this year
in february like right before like COVID became a worser disaster
(mmhmm)
yeah honestly you know like I saw this one guy you know a son of a peach on Instagram
he always does <malay>macam</malay> poll on Instagram and then got one time he <malay>tanya</malay> which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote <malay>nasi biryani</malay> I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have <malay>nasi briyani</malay> like
when I think of wedding I think of <malay>nasi biryani</malay> right
yeah and another thing that I feel like <malay>kena ada</malay> is <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> right
(mm)
(mm) <malay>macam macam pelik</malay> also [pe] like <malay>hari raya</malay> is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally [pe] like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during <malay>puasa</malay> so <malay>tak payah makan</malay>
right honestly I didn't know it was a thing but apparently it is [eh]
but like how <malay>pelik</malay> is that like <malay>puasa</malay> is like meant for
<malay>puasa</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>mana orang nak pergi</malay> wedding <malay>mana orang nak pergi</malay> celebrate <malay>semua macam merepek</malay> [kan] honestly
(mm) (mm)
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID
(err) wedding <malay>kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang</malay> [jer] [kan]
I think
you know like honestly you know how malay families <malay>macam selalu kena ada</malay> wedding <malay>besar besar</malay> [kan] honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding <malay>yang besar besar</malay> because
okay you think about it you [eh] you're the <malay>pengantin</malay> right then like <malay>penat gila</malay> [seh] you must <malay>tukar</malay> outfit <malay>berapa banyak kali</malay> throughout the day
<malay>habis</malay> you <malay>kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum</malay> the whole day I don't want
<malay>macam</malay> my wedding to be full people <malay>yang</malay> my mum <malay>tahu</malay> you know cause it's my wedding [pe] shouldn't it be people <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>tahu</malay> not my mum
yeah I think <malay>yang paling penting</malay> is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
you know how like malay families always say like [oh] it's for your image for our reputation as a family that's not how you should see it [pe] in the end
like you're marrying someone is like your happiness so everything should go the way that you want it to go you know
I also like in the future like when I get married my mom and dad will be like cool to like break the traditional stereotype and let me do what like I am happy with [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
actually that's true actually that would be goals [ah] like
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride <malay>yang cantik yang berseri</malay> you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing [lah] need to see whether my husband in the future <malay>kaya tak</malay> kidding
you know <malay>macam</malay> like (err) <malay>ada</malay> movie this one movie I forgot what the title is [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> best friends <malay>dari kecil</malay> then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
then like in the future they ended up having the wedding at the same place at the same day and that thing cause they plan together [kan]
<malay>habis</malay> like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the movie best <malay>gila</malay>
I
think no got anne hathaway I remember got anne hathaway (mm) but it was a good movie [ah] then I always think about it like
since <malay>dulu</malay> I've always wanted to do like a
wedding book but I find it like a bit tacky [lah] like imagine if like somebody find then they will judge me you know like she's like eighteen and she has a wedding book
yeah honestly like
to me when I think about the future I always want like to be special you know like
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal <malay>macam lagi</malay> best [ah] to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so <malay>bosan</malay> now
yeah like in singapore <malay>macam susah gila nak</malay> like get all these things [ah] honestly cause
okay you compare like (uh) prices of cars in singapore to prices of cars in
you can get a car in for like what
like forty thousand and then in singapore the same car will cost like hundred thousand something with C
so it's like I don't know [ah] like you think about it you can have all these dreams and aspirations but like
<malay>susah</malay> [eh] <malay>nak dapat</malay> all of it yeah so it's like
so much to think about in the future and I'm honestly very stressed
yeah I also think about it like (err) my dream die do right is to <malay>belajar</malay> in Australia
like I remember I went to Australia and I was in sec one then after that we went to where is it gold coast
then we got to pass by like this
(err) university university of queensland
then like from then I told myself like [oh] I'm going to work really hard to like get into a local like an overseas uni
but actually like if you <malay>fikir</malay> about it [lah] actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain <malay>bila</malay> like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also <malay>pun nak</malay> migrate but then if you think <malay>macam sayang</malay> right cause everyone is here then <malay>nanti raya macam mana raya</malay> will be
so lonely because now we're so used to like the big family gathering
so it's like really a lot of to think about I just hope that like
in the future you now is now is with like global warming and all
like I'm just scared that like
is there even any world to live for
yeah that's true that's why like I'm always grateful that I live in
singapore but I don't know it's really just a lot to think about in the future and like what is important to you
but I can't imagine now like <malay>sekarang</malay> [jer] <malay>[dah] susah</malay> for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
I don't how I'm going to teach that child malay
like you know <malay>dulu</malay> all my family members call me <malay>celup</malay> because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school <malay>semua orang terperanjat macam</malay> !huh!
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like <malay>berterabur</malay>
yeah actually it's true [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind <malay>yang</malay> want to totally forget about our language
you know I'll still want my children to learn and all cause I feel like it's important
later become like you know the swastika language is it
like is it swastika
I forgot what not [ah] swahili
or something yeah honestly right that language has become obsolete
like <malay>dulu</malay> like in malay class my <malay>cikgu</malay> always say like you want <malay>melayu</malay> to become obsolete is it
how all of you <malay>tak tahu cakap melayu semua</malay> then like I think about it like true [seh] like
[oh] sanskrit sanskrit
al like it's really gone
like nobody even speaks it anymore nobody knows how to write it and that kind of thing so like
how can a language just disappear <malay>macam sedih</malay> [kan] like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so it's like yeah thinking about that kind of scary
so I will try my best to improve my malay <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't know
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah honestly <malay>faham</malay> [ah] like <malay>hari raya</malay> is very like
