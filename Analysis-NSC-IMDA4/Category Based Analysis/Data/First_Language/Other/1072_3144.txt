okay so (err) found any new hobbies or you know like favourite activities ever since the COVID

(um) as for me (err)
well you know like previously if you I I mean I I prefer to go out and and such but now that kind so I feel that (err) I've learnt to you know last time I don't appreciate (um) netflix or watching movies but now I learn to
(um) you know adapt myself to try to watch netflix or you know play games and all these kind of new hobbies activities that makes me feel like maybe closer at home ya which is very
(err) depends because they now play like some (err) netflix original you know like all the chick flicks so I'm and then some of them are horror I'm into horror also so ya
something new for me ya
yes ya last time I feel like (err) it's such a waste I'm repaying every month <malay>untuk</malay> for netflix then <malay>sekarang macam</malay> it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya all the movies okay
ya
for this weekend okay (err) this weekend (err) probably you know like having lunch outside with my friends
ya or probably do some activities like (err) cycling you know ya probably I mean (err) tentative now the weather has you know [ah] you <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] [kan] weather <malay>dia sekarang nak hujan</malay>
<malay>hujan sekejap</malay> you know <malay>panas</malay> so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just (err) tentative plan
ya
how about yourself what are you going to do this weekend
[oh] cafe okay (err) do you (err) like any specific cafes that you love to go to
[oh] really <malay>dekat dekat</malay> town is it #bali# lane okay
okay
I should I should try [ah] I should <malay>pergi</malay> and you know <malay>mesti mesti</malay> weekends long queue [kan] and there's a lot of (um)
reserve
okay make reservations in advance okay so (um)
okay
[oh] it's been long time since I actually watched a movie in the cinema itself so (err) so do they do they do the social distance in the
for the seats
[oh] okay
<malay>jadi dia tak macam</malay> ya they block the seats [lah] okay
okay interesting
okay true <malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>sekarang ada</malay> movie <malay>apa yang</malay> best I mean <malay>dah lama juga tak</malay> check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online <malay>jadi</malay> (um) for us to go physically to the cinema <malay>macam</malay>
okay
so (um) ya
(mm) what
is one thing that (err) can I ask (err) what is one thing that (err) really will make you feel annoyed like you what do you
ya
cause you <malay>punya orang suka</malay> advance planning is it ya and also you <malay>kerja</malay> shift [kan] and also <malay>pasal</malay> your (um) off days
consider okay okay ya ya totally ya
I I I also prefer (um) cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when (um) someone make plans in advance so <malay>macam teratur sikit</malay> your you know your week for the week so ya
okay
(err) ya of course I prefer (err) advanced planning so I don't like it when (um) (err) for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
<malay>kalau orang buat</malay> advance planning (err)
<malay>kalau orang buat</malay> advance planning and then (err) you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially <malay>kalau kita</malay> plan big (um) occasions or (err) you know like (err) birthday parties or anything then <malay>lepas tu</malay> cancel it will be very hard you know
(err) but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel (um) annoyed is when
(err) actually someone lied to me you know like (um) behind my back it's just really annoying
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it (err) you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very <malay>marah</malay> you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest <malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> just you know admit things that you you don't like
so (um) ya
(err) that's one thing that will make me
really angry
ya
yes
ya
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like (err) because like maybe it's not a good thing <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>terlalu</malay> upfront <malay>atau terlalu</malay> honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you <malay>simpan</malay> or <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you <malay>marah</malay> and then you you keep things to yourself then
(uh) but you you still not happy about it so you you know <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that (um) you know there's no <malay>macam terasa hati</malay> that kind of thing
okay
ya <malay>lama kenal</malay> and then still keep in touch with (err) it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
grow a lot older now we just (err) communicate through (err)
instagram or social media ya because (err) most most of them are married with kids so <malay>macam</malay> they're busy <malay>dengan</malay> activity <malay>dia orang</malay> while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so <malay>nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah</malay> so now the best way is to communicate through social media
[ah] and then keep updates [lah] but then the the one that (err) I still (err) hang out with the most will be my secondary school friends also currently ya
how about yourself like are you still
okay
[oh] okay
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though (um) you know <malay>tak boleh jumpa</malay> and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact <malay>tanya khabar</malay> you know that's a very good thing
(mm)
ya
[oh] okay they are affected due to COVID
okay
ya good
(uh) ya <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>tahu</malay>
how how did you find out that (err) I'm into indo indie music
[oh] from my face my expression [oh] okay okay I didn't know that you can actually tell by (err) just looking at my
my personality and my face okay but good (err) ya good guess good guess ya you are right ya (um) I'm into indo like indie music ya currently that's (err)
(um) playing on my (err) playlist these few months ever since (err) COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music (um) <malay>suka</malay> (um) I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times <malay>kalau suka</malay> the same music then I'll just have the same
(um) over and over again especially during work working time or working hours or when I'm about to go to sleep that's the best time for me to listen to music ya ya
<malay>tengah hujan</malay> but I know that you are the opposite right you <malay>suka</malay> loud music [kan] you don't like <malay>macam</malay> cooling cooling
okay
for someone who's introvert then <malay>suka</malay> loud music ya
ya I can see that okay
emotional so you can express your feelings through music
ya okay ya true
actually
[orh] okay not that gore loud kind of thing [lah] okay okay
[oh] okay
okay
instrumental as in <malay>ada orang nyanyi ke</malay> is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
[orh] okay
[ah] <malay>tu itu kalau untuk tidur</malay> best [eh]
right okay okay
so I <malay>dengar</malay> by the way (err) you recently just start up a small business
[kan] (uh) <malay>macam yang</malay>
I I saw somewhere
small service
[oh] okay (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> what's that
[oh]
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
[ah]
so <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>dapat</malay> the idea of (um) starting up that (um) small business of yours
okay
(mm)
okay
so (err) <malay>berapa lama</malay> you [dah] you know venture into this small business
three months okay [oh] right
[oh] right okay
(mm)
(mm) okay okay
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay> true
so (um) now that (um) you [dah] venture this (err) for the trial <malay>semua</malay> for three months so (err) what are some of the obstacles that (err) you actually face throughout <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>susah</malay> that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
communication there's like barrier like language barrier
okay
okay
(mm) ya
the communications and liaise
I see
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you <malay>punya</malay> explanation <malay>tadi</malay> [kan] I think this is such a good (um) way you know to to start up like you know anyway you <malay>pun masih muda</malay> and then (err) I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you <malay>pun masih muda</malay> and then (err) I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you <malay>ada</malay> team <malay>lain macam</malay>
[oh] okay
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right <malay>dia orang pun kerja</malay>
(mm) okay
!wah! actually (uh) time management
okay I
(mm)
(mm) if you're if you are talking about business (um) ya there's a few things (err) on my mind <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>lama</malay> [lah] actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project (err) to help you know to actually (um)
kind of like support (um) like (err) you know small (err) other businesses that can help me to (err) create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me (err) to create (err) the leather sandals as per what I request <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>suka</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time (err) that this project is like the money will be going to (err) those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>tengah tengok</malay>
but then <malay>sebab sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic so I (um) (um) venture out and actually look at the quality and all to (um) the stuff
(err) I need to be <malay>kat sana</malay> physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] so I <malay>tak boleh</malay> I cannot (err)
you know like start (err) and plan is is kind of like difficult for me and to to to do a you know like trial
through (err) communication through (err) whatsapp <malay>pun</malay> it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you <malay>pun</malay> touch the material the quality ya so all these <malay>macam</malay> (err) I don't know like pandemic has (um) kind of like (err) stop (err) a lot of (um) my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know <malay>kita boleh</malay> travel and
ya
and you know (err) the economy <malay>pun kat</malay> other countries (err) affected [kan] like (err) because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support (um) you know when as we travel (um) like like for example malaysia <malay>kita semua pergi</malay> (err) to buy things ya all this now <malay>sekarang kita tak boleh</malay> we cannot go over
ya
yes ya
ya right
<malay>mahal</malay> ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you <malay>nak</malay> look at look out for your stuff <malay>tapi dah habis</malay> ya people tend to stock up a lot
ya and and
all this like <malay>macam</malay> kind of like (err) a bit difficult for us to travel around and (um) to look out for things that <malay>macam susah nak dapat</malay> you know nowadays cause everything (um) <malay>macam senang aje</malay> is very easy (err) to to sold out so you have to
(err) you know order online you know get it from other country purchase <malay>kat</malay> you know from other countries and (err) get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know (um) be stronger as (err) you know as a country as a as together
ya
yes ya so (uh) I mean twenty twenty [eh] to be honest has been such a tough (err) year for most of us like there's a lot of challenges but (um) this year is like (um) very interesting like something new for everyone so I'm just wondering about how next year
things will be like
ya
so anyway (err) okay let me ask you something okay <malay>kalau sekiranya</malay>
<malay>kalau sekiranya</malay> (err) (um) flight <malay>dah buka</malay> [lah] the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you <malay>nak pergi</malay> where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you <malay>nak pergi</malay> morocco
<malay>macam dah lama</malay> [lah] it it's on your mind that you want to
will that be your destination to your honeymoon consider [lah] okay
(mm)
okay
[oh] okay
okay
okay ya
ya new zealand new zealand
[oh] you <malay>dah pergi</malay> you have been to norway so you went
ya
cause I see like (err)
<malay>kalau macam</malay> new zealand <malay>ke</malay> you know that kind of place <malay>orang selalu buat</malay> road trip [kan] you know like new zealand australia that kind of place <malay>orang selalu</malay> might <malay>sewa</malay> like (err) rent a caravan [kan] or
or do some road trip and (um) do some <malay>macam</malay> camping camping <malay>punya</malay> style [lah] [kan] compared to it's not a city vibes <malay>punya</malay> kind of
atmosphere so it it's nice you know ya can can consider for honeymoon
right
so it <malay>kalau macam gini</malay> you cannot (err) bring your parents [lah] [kan] do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
(mm)
okay
(mm)
[oh] okay so
correct
ya and also like <malay>macam</malay> accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
(um) places to <malay>macam</malay> (err) to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe (err) the elderly might not (err) (err) feel that (err) comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I <malay>tak rasa</malay> they might you know they will like it because it's (um) something new <malay>tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan</malay> they have their own preference [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> you notice
because I've experienced before <malay>macam</malay> (err) even though my mum is (um) she likes to travel <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan] she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like <malay>macam</malay> food [lah] she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like <malay>macam</malay> maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or <malay>macam sambal</malay> you know (err) her own comfort food [lah] <malay>dia</malay> still <malay>akan</malay> prefer that compared to <malay>macam</malay> to venture out and try all the different kinds of (err)
food from the country that we are heading to so <malay>dia tak akan</malay> really <malay>macam kalau makan pun sikit aje</malay>
just a bit so <malay>dia tak akan macam</malay> into it
so <malay>kalau</malay> for me myself when I travel I would love to
(err) I would love to (err) try out like the different kinds of
like (um) food but not I can see that my for my parents case they they are not open to try something new
our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
ya correct that's why like they always pair (err) <malay>apa</malay> on standby they will bring (err) like <malay>sambal</malay> on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we (err) we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your (err) family or parents the the experience is different because maybe (uh) there's a lot of things that <malay>macam</malay>
might occur you know like (um) how the pace of how you want to travel the places you <malay>nak pergi</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you <malay>nak pergi tapi kalau dengan</malay> friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it it it's something (um) you know sometimes when I <malay>nak</malay> travel <malay>pun</malay> I will consider like should I bring my mum along or (um) okay [lah] <malay>tempat ni</malay> maybe I (err) just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not (um)
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
see the volcano (err) <malay>dekat</malay> indo something [kan] <malay>nak naik</malay> (err) the <malay>gunung</malay> but my mum say that [oh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like !hey! that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions (err) precautions and such <malay>tapi</malay> my mum will still think that <malay>tak boleh</malay> you know
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
ya true ya ya <malay>semua tanggung dengan</malay> parents
okay (um) I just love snow okay I <malay>suka</malay> winter even though
okay previously [kan] (err) I was studying overseas [kan] so (err) it was such a
good experience for me to (err) to finally <malay>dapat rasa</malay> you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and <malay>yang ke mana-mana yang ada</malay> snow
so <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> experience snow <malay>tu</malay> I was like a bit <malay>jakun</malay> [lah] then I was like a bit like !wow! snow and then (err) at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad <malay>sampai</malay> negative the temperature was really bad ya but (um)
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that (um) you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore <malay>panas pun panas</malay> but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in <malay>sejuk dia macam</malay> one kind ya
but (um) still I I <malay>suka</malay> snow because of I can <malay>main</malay> I can play with the snow and then (err) and then the the the season like the vibes (um)
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry (err) so <malay>dia macam</malay> the feeling <malay>dia</malay> to christmas <malay>lagi-lagi macam</malay> so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
still prefer to (um) to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
[oh] okay
ya
autumn okay
cause like winter [kan] that's when the only time you <malay>boleh pakai</malay> thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers <malay>yang</malay> all the <malay>seluar kat</malay> singapore you <malay>tak boleh</malay> you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to (um)
look different ya but then (um) ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets <malay>semua</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is (err) pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these (um) jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I <malay>jual ke</malay> you know
or should I <malay>buang</malay> you know ya
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
I would really (err) want to I really <malay>nak</malay> one thing that I really <malay>nak pergi</malay> after this (err) one place sorry (err) would be japan ya
I've been trying to (err) but then I heard a lot of things like <malay>macam mahal juga</malay> [lah] their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe <malay>bila pergi</malay> japan you <malay>pernah pergi</malay> [kan]
[oh] okay

<malay>mahal</malay>
bullet train okay okay
I see
ya I I heard a lot about (err) <malay>pasal</malay> japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food (err) I mean (um) that japan has a lot of good food <malay>tapi macam</malay> when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit #tokyo# though like (um) ya <malay>macam</malay> #tokyo# is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
but ya
but it's okay (um)
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you <malay>dah pernah pergi</malay> (err) japan [kan]
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
last time <malay>kita tak</malay> appreciate (err) <malay>buat</malay> travelling [kan] <malay>kita selalu</malay> (err) feel that okay anytime <malay>boleh pergi</malay> you know next time [lah] next year but then <malay>sekarang</malay> when it's really like <malay>macam</malay> stop us from travel
the feeling is like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] all these while especially <malay>kalau pasal gambar macam</malay> like let's say <malay>kita dah</malay> frequent <malay>pergi</malay> that country
[ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>tak payah pergi</malay> you know then all these memories <malay>macam</malay> [oh] no it's wasted <malay>macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar</malay> that kind of thing
but okay (um)
anything that you <malay>nak tanya</malay> I
(uh) does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to (err) having formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
(err)
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like (err) small spider or <malay>semut</malay> sometimes I can be like you know
I I <malay>tak nak pegang</malay> I don't want to I don't want to kill it <malay>tak tak nak</malay> you know even though <malay>kita pakai</malay> tissue to throw it to <malay>angkat</malay> [kan] ya I'll be like <malay>tak nak</malay> you know just scared
<malay>cicak</malay> you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid [lah] because <malay>orang cakap</malay> like <malay>dah mati apa</malay> for example especially when it's dead [kan] then <malay>dah mati apa</malay> so like just just <malay>angkat</malay> [lah] but I still like no I got that fear and
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
(um) ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
because maybe because (um) <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>naik</malay> plane then [kan] <malay>ada</malay> clouds like covering so you <malay>tak nampak</malay> [tau] <malay>bawah sangat</malay>
and you are in a <malay>macam</malay> covered closed like you're inside the plane [what] so <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> exposed <malay>sangat</malay> you know to look down <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say it's a
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay> jump from a high a high building or something (err) you have to look down [kan] so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
okay
okay
(mm) ya
actually (err) when I was in hong-kong [kan] I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track (err) I was in hong-kong so (err) I <malay>naik</malay> this (err) cable car [tau] you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's (err) so you <malay>boleh nampak bawah</malay> your <malay>kaki</malay> can look through <malay>kat bawah</malay> so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared <malay>naik</malay> cable car <malay>biasa boleh apa</malay> but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
(err) you know I won't be scared of it but apparently (uh) ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to <malay>macam jatuh</malay> the feeling
so I guess ya even you <malay>naik</malay> luge [kan] you [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> open luge as in the <malay>apa yang</malay> the skyride <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>dekat</malay> #sentosa#
[ah] ya correct that one <malay>itu pun macam</malay> open <malay>apa</malay> ya your legs dangling so <malay>macam</malay>
that one also I won't dare to <malay>macam ambil ambil</malay> video <malay>ambil gambar</malay> cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing <malay>macam</malay> is kind of critical [ah] I feel <malay>tapi orang cakap</malay> it's quite silly [lah] but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared <malay>tapi orang lain</malay> probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
but how about (um)
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
(mm)
a bee stung [ah]
[oh] okay
[ah] okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
[oh]
did you shout
can you can you try to (err) you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
[oh] okay
[oh] so where where did the spider <malay>tu apa lari</malay> then <malay>pergi</malay> somewhere like left or you had to kill it you <malay>kena bunuh</malay>
went away ya
actually is is that the spider <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>tahu kaki dia</malay> like <malay>tipis ke ke dia</malay>
I I don't know the the name of the spider
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ada kaki yang</malay> spider <malay>yang tipis ada yang</malay> very
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya [oh] no
I'm so glad like <malay>macam kalau</malay> singapore <malay>tak</malay> you you know <malay>tak macam sangat</malay> [lah] you know <malay>masuk</malay> spider but then if you are in <malay>kalau macam</malay> summer (um) season that's when the spiders (um) start to appear in in your house
so they start to <malay>masuk</malay> because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
(mm)
ya
so (um)
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say for example I <malay>suruh</malay> you (err) go and pick up a cockroach <malay>yang dah mati</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] just use your bare hands <malay>angkat macam gitu</malay>
ya
just like that <malay>angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh</malay> you know just
carry (err)
!ee! antenna okay I mean you <malay>boleh angkat macam gitu</malay> with your bare hands [oh] no
okay okay
okay
speaking of insects [kan] so (err) what do you think about <malay>orang-orang yang</malay> (err) actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like (err) is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you <malay>boleh ke makan</malay> cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
you tried
[oh]
!huh! in thailand
okay
(mmhmm)
cocoon
okay (mm)
because (err) some people always say that okay obviously (um) the
(err) obviously is like (um) the the the insects that is sold (um) for you to like can be consumed they say that it's (err) clean but you know it's clean (um)
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know <malay>macam</malay> it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know [lah] what where they found those kind of insect
but I still find disgusting even though like (um) they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to (um) to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
(err) you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
[orh]
ya
ya ya ya
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can <malay>macam</malay> at least the texture of the the <malay>dia punya</malay> shell <malay>macam</malay> edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
[oh] ya maybe probably ya but (um)
very interesting to see like (uh) maybe you you know (err) like like even when (um) when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
(err) is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a (um) they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them [kan] the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically (um) I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get (um) halal food because mostly (err) they eat like
pork is part of their you know <malay>macam</malay> culture they like to eat ya
yup okay
so I mean (err)
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that (um) I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have (err) been jumping a lot of topics but it actually (err)
you know connects us our conversation to to speak (err)
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we (um) when we we we talk is always on (err) whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can (err) do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
(um)
any any other questions that you want ask me
<malay>ada tak</malay>
because I know you are a very curious person [kan] so probably you might want to ask
[oh] so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it [oh] it isn't the latest [lah] the latest [kan] is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay (err) ya I mean (err) it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
but I know I can see that you are an android user you <malay>pakai</malay> samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about (um) samsung
front camera <malay>ke atau yang</malay> back the back camera

the middle part <malay>tu</malay> [lah] the screen <malay>punya macam</malay>
okay
okay
that's that's (uh) that's good
[oh] ya I think (um) ya that's quite ya the downside of it [lah] I mean we we've been paying
quite a lot for iphone you know and then <malay>bila</malay> they they start to have like [ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> charger (err) you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok dia punya</malay>
<malay>bahagian</malay> at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old (err) ya the cable wire ya so it's like (um)
quite a hassle because usually the normal [kan] but then ya
ya ya correct correct so you <malay>nak beli</malay> the head <malay>tu</malay> you <malay>kena beli</malay> a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know (err) I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you (err) so <malay>kalau nanti</malay> free you just
