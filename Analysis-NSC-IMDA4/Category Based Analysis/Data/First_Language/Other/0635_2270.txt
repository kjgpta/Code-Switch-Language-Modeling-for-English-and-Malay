so we went to walk around first then around me six fifty then we made our way to <malay>masjid sultan</malay> then you know now got the safe entry staff so we cannot really (um) <malay>masuk</malay> early [kan] so we had to waste our time first before we go to <malay>masjid</malay> then
we went to walk around #bugis#
but
ya then (um)
then cause I saw innisfree right then I had to buy my facial wash so I was like [eh] can we go innisfree then he was like okay can can then cause when we were talking (um) we were chatting on telegram
he we kept finding like that we kept finding out that we had a lot of
similar stuff and
not common interest it's like
we do some
similar stuff then we also buy similar stuff
all of that
stuff
so we were like creeped out
so he asked me
what
so what kind of facial wash do you buy then I say
the #bija# one then he was like
!alamak! we have to stop buying doing the same stuff then I was like
I already bought it first so
yes
ya cute cute don't even didn't even work out
[ah]
when was it it was like in
I think july okay wait we went out like second july I remember the date
then (um) like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend <malay>meninggal</malay>
ya then I mean I'm not gonna blame his friend's death [lah] but like it went downhill from there
so cannot really say much
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know <malay>orang tu baru meninggal</malay> [kan]
then
I'm not
<malay>aku tak</malay> expect <malay>kau</malay> to be like
as cheerful as you were you know
like
I give him space to like mourn his friend's death and stuff but
at some point it's
just too much I guess
when I'm
but you know how I am right
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him <malay>macam</malay>
[eh] are you okay like are we okay that kind of stuff but like at this
like at that point in time <malay>aku tak cakap apa-apa</malay> cause
I understand and I don't want to push him too much but like
[meh]
there was no closure honestly
he ghosted me
no it's okay
honestly that last conversation [kan] he <malay>dia minta maaf</malay> cause (um) <malay>dia tahu yang apa macam</malay>
he he knows he's in the wrong [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself [pe] so I included my own thoughts about that matter [ah]
then he ghost me I'm like bro
ya
over that maybe my words or something I don't know [lah] but it's just like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like he could have
kind of like told me some stuff that make me like feel better a little bit but he didn't he just like blue tick me and went away so I don't know what to do I mean I am getting over him [ah] but
I mean
but he's such a good guy though
no I'm not
full of crank
honestly I think so
but
no I don't want
if he is
if <malay>kalau dia datang balik</malay> [kan]
I will just say that (um)
friends
I don't know <malay>kalau jodoh jodoh</malay>
thumbs up and a heart
friend zone
input
ya it's a difficult situation
that's why okay that's why when I you know me I always confront stuff [pe] I feel like
it's not fair or <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
that should like at least show him that I care about him what but I actually do care about him is just that
at some point I feel like
yes ya and also <malay>macam</malay>
trying too hard I guess
cause I okay I I I like check up on him like every two days then he will always reply like he will always give late replies but like at least he reply
(hmm)
no cause okay the thing is when we started first started talking right he always reply me very fast maybe cause it's period [ah] but [eh]
fast replies (mm)
so but
when I think <malay>bila fikir balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay>
all this pain
not worth it I guess
you see we just been talking for what two three months
I don't think I don't
<malay>aku fikir dia tak akan</malay>
(um) <malay>datang balik pun</malay>
ego
you know
unless unless like what
<malay>allah allah kasi petunjuk yang aku memang untuk dia</malay>
then he will chase me and
no
(mm)
if really then I'll give in [ah] but if not then <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
now also I'm not looking also
men are trash
why are we made to be straight when #allah# create men like this

<malay>lelaki</malay>
so <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>sekarang kau tak berbual dengan dia</malay> [ah]
at all
I like how this time around you are okay
about all of these
(um) I got one
more news I mean
I <malay>kau ingat sampah</malay>
ya
ya that's the first one which was like in april <malay>bila aku masih berbual dengan lelaki lagi satu tu</malay>
but then like after I stop
talking to the guy I went out with a date with
on a date with
(um)
<malay>dia masih</malay> chat <malay>aku lagi</malay>
but it's not on whatsapp
it was on wechat when we first talk to each other then he's like I really want to talk to you then I was like bro
!huh!
<malay>belum belum</malay>
how <malay>dah tak boleh balik</malay> [kan] cause
<malay>dia masih sekolah kat</malay> china [kan]
so
I don't think they will get send back [ah] cause he supposed to be three years there this is his first year
so
no I didn't
wechat no blue tick
I deleted the chat
but
now I feel like I want to reply him cause okay it's not cause I have
any feelings for him again right it's just like <malay>macam</malay> why why do you want to talk to me like I thought you went back to your ex that she don't like
I don't know probably happy that you got back together then why he why do you want to talk to me again like
why
I mean the thing is I can still talk to him as a friend but like overseas friend but I mean I won't I won't fall in love with him again bro
but
it's like I just want to know why you want to talk to me okay whatever the hell you done
but like at the same time I don't want to tell him to let him feel like I have been thinking about him
and like I have been what debating but I don't think men think until that kind of part you know cause men are like simple
when they overthink it's about it's not about this
overthink about something else
games
(um)
[oh] you think about sex
no one think about feelings
stupid
(mm)
ya just like (um) why question mark

what do
december will be like what one year since we met
he doesn't
I don't need long I don't need a long time to know him to know how he is
but the other guy yes cause I don't understand him
<malay>tak faham langsung</malay>
cause okay the thing is right if you if I confront you about something and then he straightaway was like [oh] I'm not perfect boyfriend material blah blah blah blah like he starts off
the
debate quotation mark debate
with that sentence in particular that means we are in a talking stage right
and then he
but I guess
<malay>aku fikir dia fikir macam kita kawan</malay> [jer] <malay>kot</malay>
he did say that but like I wasn't pushy or anything
what a pussy
but ya
okay [ah] not bad
experience

and like I carry about three boxes every morning
up to the sink to cut the vegetables
my back hurts I cried bro I thought it would I wouldn't recover

it wasn't
like <malay>macam aku fikir</malay>
in <malay>dalam kepala aku</malay> [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak akan baik</malay> cause
I only had like two days break and then like those two days break right the pain was still there
then after that I have to do it again
so it's just like building on then when I finally didn't go didn't put in my shifts cause school was starting [kan] then
the the pain went away I was like wait [oh] okay
so I cried for nothing
but [eh] <malay>sampai mak aku risau</malay> [seh] <malay>mak aku</malay> was like
<malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>nangis</malay>
how the heck
it's pain no cannot I don't want
like I asked my mother <malay>urut</malay> also
<malay>tak hilang</malay> so I was just like
ya
like I have this trick where you lie down flat on the ground with no pillow on your head then it's just like straight straight then it will hurt but it will flatten out your back cause of gravity
so
ya but I don't know didn't really work but
the yoga pose
<malay>aku tak tahu buat</malay>
[oh]
later can
but my back not pain anymore
#inshaallah#
retail
but I don't think that is that
(um)
as painful as that cause
<malay>potong</malay>
<malay>sayur</malay>
knife
I got cut myself you know
the auntie literally was like [eh] be careful that one sharp [ah] you don't touch
I literally didn't even touch it I was just
it was just like
(um)
I don't know how to explain it it's just <malay>macam</malay>
I didn't really put force you know it was just like a
a tap or something my palm tap the knife the blade
and then I get a damn cut
and there was so much blood and the auntie scold me
the auntie was like
<malay>aku dah cakap jangan pegang kau pergi pegang</malay> then I was like
no I didn't
I didn't
I didn't hold
but ya
it was painful
but I'm not scared of cuts [lah] but it's just like
subway subway
the place is really toxic the workplace is very toxic
I can don't tell you that it is toxic
wait what did you friend what did your friends didn't say
ya they do
okay it's not like reuse the bread [lah] it's like
the previous day <malay>punya</malay> bread
they will just keep it in the bread (um)
what's that
the place where they store the bread
and then the next day breakfast if people order then we will use that
but but I mean cause we toast it right
we toast it before we serve so
it's
right
I mean
if it's mouldy we will not
sell the bread [lah]
but like for vegetable I can say that (um) cause I cut vegetables right
[ah] you know bell peppers
the top and the bottom actually have to cut it off but then (um) cause they say like sometimes cause (uh) not enough or something
we will cut that too
then we include it in the box in the container then we serve
customer that
the only thing I take is like lettuce and cucumber carrot but cucumber we cut ourselves lettuce no they come in bags vacuum packed
so I guess lettuce is fresh but
and the rest is also fresh [lah] cause
we always get
<malay>macam</malay> boxes of it
every time every time is production day
always we always have to order directly
the vegetables
so I guess it's quite fresh [lah] not bad
(uh) it's a small restaurant thai to go but
[eh] that one right the pay #masyaallah#
<malay>sedap</malay> cause
I mean the thing is right we only take orders serve customer (uh) maybe sometimes wash dishes and then we have to make sure that delivery orders are
like they order through online right so we we have we will get emails about the orders so you have to print the order give to the kitchen and the delivery rider
that's all it's not that it's not that (um)
complicated
why
[orh]
I mean I mess up a lot of times
so
like
but the way they key in the order is cool it's like
all on the computer
you know like how
restaurant key in orders is like there's a kiosk at the front right no it's inside the office
it's not even a kiosk it's a computer
kiosk is the <malay>macam</malay> mcdonald's <malay>tu</malay>
mcdonald's <malay>yang kau</malay> order <malay>kat depan tu abeh dia picit picit yang itu</malay> [ah]
it's not like that
ours is a computer
then the money all okay maybe it's just not a established restaurant [ah] but
it's cool
bro eight dollars per hour and like
the work is not even that stressful I can just sit there and do my shit know
cause so far away
it's at okay it's like now it's (uh) you know #kembangan# station
in front of the <malay>masjid</malay>
but I mean I can text her [oh] I can text her back and be like can I work
(mm)
I think you have to go interview
but I'm
I can go and work
but
(um) there's a straight bus from your house eight five four
I will I will also take eight five four but you have to walk a bit [ah]
<malay>depan</malay>
<malay>depan</malay> (um)
ya
then you take to #kembangan# station then you have to walk to <malay>masjid</malay> then cross
but the restaurant okay the restaurant is okay but <malay>makanan dia sedap</malay>
we get free lunch and dinner if you work that's why I like working there and the pay is way more than like
Subway
is
ya
I should have bargained bro
can like at least seven dollars [lah] [sia]
my back hurts from nothing for six fifty only but then
I guess six fifty is easy money
cause subway
I don't know how it was easy money [ah] cause every month I can get four hundred but they minus for also gang ten percent only
so
but that one is if I work like almost
almost everyday I work [sia]
four hundred
(mm)
if not it's like what one hundred two hundred
(mm)
that one the the (um)
<malay>paling pendek</malay> is
four hours
and that one can get really
thirty six dollars
already
no cause we have quite a lot of admin also
so <malay>nak kerja susah sikit</malay>
I think [ah] I'm not sure how good they they grow or like did they even grow cause right
kind of hard
but
okay <malay>tapi kalau kerja sana</malay> [kan]
this everyone else is guy except for you
that's why it's a little bit scary for me
but they won't do anything
I hope
<malay>asal takut</malay>
I mean
a mouse
you're a mouse
I mean
[oh]
no
then I'm not scared
ya I know
I was scared too
they were adults and when I was working that time I was like seventeen
and then like
bro sometimes they
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
wait the
okay so got
a few times I work closing so I have to make sure that
I mop everything <malay>sapu</malay>
<malay>sapu</malay> the outside and inside the office also
then the kitchen obviously the cooks will handle it right but then
I already put
the dishes like the customers ate from
at the back
so they have to wash it what but then never then I'm like
what the heck and they went home already and then the kitchen was dark then I was like <malay>takkan nak biarkan ni kat sini nanti</malay>
got rats
will come cockroaches will come
so I went to on the kitchen lights
and wash it and then the <malay>tempat</malay>
<malay>cuci pinggan</malay> is at the back near the back door then the back door
it was like damn dark
outside
cause it was at night like nine and it but my father was outside [ah] cause he was waiting for me he pick me up always

cause it's a small restaurant
then got everywhere
you take money people can see
then we have to ensure the float is like fifty hundred but (um) different cash or whatever then if the kitchen want to buy more eggs or whatever they need to tell me then I give the money then they have to give me the receipt then I have to keep in the float
it's actually not that hard

but I don't know where to work
if only they take in
youngsters
okay we are not really youngsters we're like
youth please
youth
I want to work in a library
no one will talk to you
no human interaction
then now <malay>pakai</malay> mask [kan]
shoot daggers
and but if you work
I know
twenty one
cause when you work in library you are under cisco
cisco is a police
and
I don't know I never check
cause library don't really
ask for workers (mm)
you should apply
you want to go
and ask
there and be like can I apply

(mm)
one of my lecturers also like that
like okay cause
ya science
(um)
<malay>punya</malay> course [kan]
so it's more theory based
but the thing is she reads off the slides
in her lecture videos
and it's so annoying cause when she gives us test
or (uh) quizzes
even though it's open book you cannot find it in the notes
so how am I supposed to answer the questions
then later we fail you'll be like
then if she go through
isn't this in the notes
why don't you try reading your notes and referring back to your question and find the answer to your question even if you know the answer already there is no answer in the notes
ya but
do you know the feeling where like after you have done you are done with everything then you read again then you understand
that that always happen to me
