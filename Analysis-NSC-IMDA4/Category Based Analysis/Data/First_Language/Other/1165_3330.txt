[orh] I'm okay [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> lately <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] because (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> COVID [kan] so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
<malay>atau</malay> just (uh) watch new dramas [lah] basically
ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
correct correct then the one that I regret the most <malay>sekarang</malay> is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> the one that you invited me to watch [ah] demon slayer
ya
(uh) because the thing is like (uh) when I first saw the trailer
for me personally right [ah] (uh) <malay>aku bukan</malay> a fan of <malay>apa ni macam</malay> cute cute (uh) type of (err) art style for the (err) anime for me I prefer like <malay>macam</malay> semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret <malay>gila</malay> serious because it's like (uh) the storyline <malay>bagus</malay> and then like <malay>dia punya</malay> action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away [ah] so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right (uh) it was
I was quite behind the hype already [lah] in a way
ya
(um)
[orh] okay
ya because (uh)
when I started (uh) I think I don't know how like (err) I was in cause I think (um) a lot of people watch already but [ah] even then when I watch later the hype was still there so (err) the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so (uh) I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the #manga# [eh] I I'm gonna read the #manga# sorry not watch ya but it was really good [lah] ya
(mm)
then it ended
[orh] september
[oh] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
[oh] one shot [ah]
rise up [ah] ya
ya
(mm) (mm)
#naruto#
[ah]
(mm)
ya
that's why but (err) but (err) adding on to <malay>yang</malay> the older <malay>punya</malay> #animes# even initial D <malay>pun</malay> [kan] it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then <malay>macam</malay> it got so much hype and like so much (um) (err) attention right it just blows my mind [ah] ya and I really thought it's it's really nice [lah] and
not gonna lie [ah] it's very rare (um) for this kind of (err) shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause [ah] the part <malay>yang</malay>
(err) I think is the one <malay>yang</malay> the second episode <malay>yang dia pergi bunuh</malay> the very big demon then he touch the head
(uh) ya the the the one who killed the <malay>punya kawan</malay>
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was (um) the <malay>apa</malay> moon that got strip of his (uh) power <malay>pasal dia tak</malay> (uh) eat enough humans the one who use the drums [ah]
ya (uh) I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then <malay>tak ada orang</malay> appreciate <malay>dia</malay> so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
(uh) <malay>terkesan</malay> like I was like shocked [lah] when I cried a bit I was like [eh] <malay>tak pernah pernah macam gini</malay> the last time I cried was like (err) what endgame
[ah] (um) avengers endgame [ah]
very rare so I was blown away [ah]
[ah] no [lah] ya ya
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kompang</malay> <malay>kompang</malay> <malay>gitu</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi tapi</malay> stress [ah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> battle <malay>tu</malay> the other one that (err) was more stressful was the <malay>punya</malay> the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when (uh) #nezuko# and #tanjiro# killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off [what] it's such a coward move but #gui# is just
<malay>sekali</malay> a one time slash then <malay>mati</malay>
that's why <malay>tak</malay> fair <malay>gila</malay> serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
(mm)
blow me away it's okay
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya even the intro <malay>dia punya</malay> what they call it opening I don't know opening [ah] the opening was also quite <malay>macam</malay> blood pumping [ah] for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally [eh] for you is the music [kan] for me is the [ah] story line itself
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
(um) (uh) give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect <malay>macam dia tak</malay> just <malay>bunuh</malay> cause [oh] you're a demon cause (err) he take the time to like understand them look back [ah] look through their memories and then like say like [eh] you used to be human [lah] so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
(uh) I think that's the main [ah] unique point of [ah] demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
(mm)
correct correct
(mm)
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
(mm)
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that (uh) (um)
I I kind of (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> regret a bit right apart from (um) not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that (err) to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> I look <malay>macam</malay> [ah] sometimes look at the art style <malay>macam</malay> very cutesy cutesy <malay>dia macam takda</malay> substance to it [ah] but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some #animes# are good it's not everytime <malay>macam</malay> those like (uh) act cute <malay>atau macam</malay> very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the #animes# are really damn good so <malay>aku macam</malay> semi regret so for me personally [ah] for demon slayer right I started on #naruto#
(um) [ah] I know it's one of the best #animes# but draggy <malay>gila</malay> it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch [ah] but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also [ah] the day before <malay>pasal</malay> one piece so that [one] will try so I start #naruto# first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer #naruto# or one piece [ah] actually
one piece [eh] (uh) because (uh) #naruto# the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes [lah] so it's not too not too <malay>macam</malay> mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya <malay>tapi</malay> are these sorry is this the format for (err) anime like each episode got twenty minutes <malay>atau</malay>
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> movie is it
[orh] short film
(mm)
ya
[ah]
[pe]
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm <malay>hilang</malay> ya
(mm)
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
(uh) bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science [one] science is programing [ah] ya
ya I see your math <malay>semalam</malay> [jer] <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> that's why I I don't take math
ya
(mm)
(mm)
that's why
correct correct <malay>yang semalam</malay> you show me the <malay>pasal apa tu</malay> row operation that [one] obviously I try [ah] but I really I really don't understand [lah] but the first few question I understand [lah] ya
ya [ah] the the velocity part I think
[ah] something like that ya ya but sorry my math <malay>tak bagus sangat</malay>
[ah]
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) famous [ah] ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
(mm)
(mm)
correct
(mmhmm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you [ah] force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself <malay>tak faham</malay> then you have to like (uh) you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt <malay>juga</malay>
when I started
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
yeah I guess <malay>macam</malay> (uh) if like you if you like <malay>tanya</malay> then like you didn't try then think <malay>macam</malay> people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really <malay>kalau macam</malay> we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about (uh) your course is that (uh) at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally <malay>rabak gila</malay> [ah] [ah] I take english but then like (err) if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment <malay>juga</malay>
ya ya cause <malay>mak kau cikgu</malay> ya ya ya that's why it's it's true [ah] like I I always thought I had the mindset like <malay>boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri</malay> just <malay>belajar</malay> [jer] just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you [ah] they call it (um) crystallisation of your thinking like make your (uh) [ah] word flow much more (uh) smoother [ah] in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya [eh] <malay>tak tak</malay> I I saw in my study guide <malay>apa</malay> crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation (uh) like (um) basically they encourage <malay>macam</malay> (um) making study groups and all that cause for me like (uh) like you (err) yourself [ah] <malay>aku pun</malay> introvert that time (um) when I want to try ask <malay>macam malu-malu</malay> cause I feel #paiseh# [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
people think like you don't do your (err) revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is [ah] sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
(mm)
ya
[oh] this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe [ah]
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
ya
(uh) ya ya ya ya ya
in a way [ah] in the same time at the same time from what you explain <malay>macam</malay> is to juggle the <malay>perasaan</malay> of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
(um) some (um) I think it's very rare [lah] that there are people who are very <malay>macam</malay> clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to <malay>jaga hati</malay> and try to be more mindful what they say
but it depends on the person itself [lah] but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice [ah] ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
as very (um) ruthless or very blunt [lah] <malay>macam</malay> later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel <malay>macam</malay> very (um)
[ah] that's why that's why <malay>rasa kecil hati kirakan</malay> ya
ya
ya
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] then when they continue doing that then they don't learn [kan] they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise <malay>asal semua orang</malay> keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me <malay>masa dulu</malay> I was very sensitive so now I try to <malay>macam</malay> balance out [lah]
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best [lah] cause over time like you have to
(um) adapt [ah] I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
(uh)
ya can I share one story ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> I'm guilty of this so (err) so (err) (err) (err) the the one thing that (err) you mentioned about time management there is it for me [kan] honestly speaking [ah]
(err) for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest [ah] this one I haven't share with you before (uh) so (um)
I kind of (err) didn't sit for my paper
ya so (err) this news right I'm just telling you this (um) okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that (um) if you don't sit for your paper
and then (uh) if you have (err) I think the requirement for the assignments is like (err) forty percent and above that means your over [ah] there are two components (uh) assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without (err) redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod [ah] so
for me
okay [lah] for me since I'm new to it [lah] like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
balance and all that so I admit [ah] sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so (um) before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I (uh) consulted (err) my partner and my mother then they said that is fine [lah] then I think about it <malay>macam tak</malay> affect my grade cause there was a time before [what] I failed my exam then my (uh) drop <malay>rabak gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like (um) if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just (err) restudy [lah] and the good thing [ah] about my school now is that since COVID right (uh) they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right (uh) you have to pay the fee [tau] it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free [lah] cause of COVID so like I'll just do it [lah] but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty <malay>macam</malay> I feel so bad <malay>macam kirakan</malay> I can clear the mod [one] then <malay>macam</malay> I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again (uh) cause (uh) the last time I checked if I fail again [kan]
<malay>aku boleh tendang sekolah</malay> [lah] like fully [ah] I (err) I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is (err) academic termination then you have to it's as if (err) after you <malay>kena</malay> terminated it's as if you have to (err) re-enrolled [lah] to the school so that's the downside [lah] so I'm like [ah] I don't wanna take the risk [ah] I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh]
like like
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away <malay>kena</malay> that kind of
[oh] range [oh] okay okay okay
[ah] [ah] that's what I <malay>kena</malay> ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos [ah] if I'm being honest so like I think about it [ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] just resit [ah]
I don't want to risk it ya <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] <malay>hati</malay> that time ya
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to [lah] cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right [oh] for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different [ah] assignments and projects ya so because your school is (uh) assignment and project based my [one] is [ah] exam so that's the thing you all also have (err)
intermittent exams right
math [oh] my goodness
don't have (err)
(uh) not exactly math but I think (err) since your mum is a english teacher she should know also (err) there's this thing called (err) phonetics and (um) what is it under [ah] it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like (um) if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
(um) put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a (um) sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part [lah]
(uh)
there is one ya ya there is (uh) the (uh) what mod I took I think they taught us about (err) there are some similarities (uh) between (err) varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
(uh) are there but how there are different so that (um) when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english [eh] I'm if I'm speaking english and <malay>kau cakap macam</malay> [ah] there are structures to it that make it different [ah] I think it's [ah] sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages [ah]
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya something like that [lah] like they have a (uh) a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences [ah] ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages [ah] if like you use (uh) malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like <malay>susah</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
(um) ya [lah] because essentially
it's a translation but then like (err) one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like (err) the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part [ah] ya I think there was once I I look (err) the one that my prof taught me was (err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
professor ya sorry (err) professor [ah] [eh] [ah] so casual <malay>panggil</malay> prof (uh) she talk about english in (uh) do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya <malay>allah</malay> [eh] sorry sorry (err) so basically (um)
(err) they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office [sia]
<malay>pejabat</malay> office right
[ah] <malay>pejabat pos</malay> so it's like it's reverse [ah] so that's the different thing
[oh] ya but okay [lah] (uh) that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about (err)
language and society like how people use language and all that that [one] is more to (um)
I would say (uh) you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how [ah] different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
[ah] dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's (uh) in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of (err) analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now [eh] I wish I I don't have to take is (uh) literature
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it [ah] so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so <malay>panjang</malay> right so like [ah] [tau] <malay>boleh takpe</malay> [lah] just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly (uh) change it like that like (um) they just make it english language and literature like (um) why they don't have the presets cause last time (uh) when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that (um)
but they rebrand it so like no choice [ah] I just stayed [ah] cause I have to defer for (err) one semester

<malay>apa ni</malay> putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you

correct (uh) there's one prime example (uh) I think is everyone's favourite
unfortunately he died already [ah] it's iron man games of thrones <malay>tak</malay> game of thrones <malay>tak</malay> that (uh) one prime (uh) character in the Marvel (uh)
wait is he is not right [ah] Marvel cinematic universe [ah] iron man [ah] he don't have any powers but like he he's (uh) drive to make the world a better place and too (um) I think in age of ultron he said he want to like (uh) have a iron barrier around earth (uh) to like sort of protect [lah] but (um) even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like (uh) protect what's what matters to him the most [ah] so like (um)
(uh) adding to your part <malay>macam</malay> (uh) when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
get the power from your own (uh)
belief and then like [ah] actually (um) it's not technically a superpower [lah] but it's more of like it's (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err)
his ability to (uh) be a genius
and like (uh) construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it [lah] like people always look at the (uh) powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
(uh) thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right [ah] and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes [ah] and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing [eh] cause I just realised this now I'm having this (uh) [eh] epiphany <malay>macam</malay> if you notice [eh] in endgame
(uh) black widow and iron man <malay>tak ada</malay> power [tau] but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then (uh) iron man <malay>dia</malay> (uh) take the <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) gauntlet from (err) thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really [ah] all the efforts for nothing but then like (err) he managed to get all the infinity stones on his (uh) hand then he just snap [ah] so it takes a lot of (um) courage to do that you know so like it was is is really (um) mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
I think she was like (err) (um)
(uh) assassin or some sort then she got (um) (err) close combat (err) training and iron man is just (err) a man with a suit [lah] but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite (err) touching [ah] if you think about it no power [tau]

<malay>dan</malay> cause also (um)
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice (um)
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now [ah] [eh] I'm working part time [lah] ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry [ah] but my job got suspended because of COVID so like (err) I cannot work for the meantime so (um) I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy [ah] but it's you're on the right track [ah] so it is relevant [lah] it's a good thing

but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like (err) I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering (uh) the zero gravity there is quite (uh)
quite intense [ah] so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve (uh) being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something [ah]
ya cause if he want to be married [eh] buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya

ya but how many light years away is mars [ah]
I never thought about it [eh]
ya
[oh] it's not light years
years
[oh] but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough [eh]
I don't know how they do it [sia] seriously
ya ya ya correct
young [ah] !wah! that's a good thing [eh] like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya ya [orh] then (err) it'll be relatable to (uh) demon slayer when (uh) in the movie (uh) what's his name [eh] [ah] correct me if I'm wrong [ah] #asaka# <malay>ke</malay> #akaza# #akaza# he wanted to offer (uh) #rengoku# to be a a demon [what] ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die [ah] so
(um) if you remain at technically if you get to live forever <malay>atau</malay> you (um) remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it (uh) like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive [ah] then you wouldn't die [ah]
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
(mm)
ya
correct correct

that's right
ya ya ya
<malay>takyah mandi</malay>
ya
correct correct ya ya ya

because you don't have to drive to progress [ah] then like you just stay stagnant [ah] like (uh) because it's not affecting you [what] and that's the thing about humans [lah] like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
but probably why [ah] sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable [ah] (err) probably why the <malay>apa</malay> six demon didn't (uh)
change [ah] the [ah] sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change [ah] but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the #manga# or the watch the (uh) talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of (um)
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph [ah]
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
(mm)

I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb [eh] I guess [ah] when people pass on they look at the good things [ah] and they try to overlook the (uh) bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
(um) his negative aspects (um) (err)
even though they were quite drastic but (uh) the achievements overshadow that [ah] but in the end when everyone passes on right is (um)
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them [ah] recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper (um)
what's the word [eh] passing [eh] no (um) [ah] final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status (err) for awhile then like (um) at least you (um) go in peace [ah] like ya you don't feel like [oh] (um)
there's anything left
[ah] ya ya ya you you feel like (err) a burden off your shoulder [ah] in a way
what's why
