ya so the correct so the third year aku move out err then I was uh staying dekat my aunty's punya place lah so what happens is uh I was there uh for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia kan for very long it's about
uh I they gave me hints lah ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years err my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way err they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then uh that was the the time where aku just uh you know just tried to just tried to to survive lah you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof lah and then I was you know so that was a good thing lah
correct so that was that was err err you know err at the end of the three years then err aku early this this this year ah first of january actually
err sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay lah so that means macam um kadang-kadang she will invite me back tau macam um you know to to her to the family home lah but uh sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
um she totally changed bukan change macam apa ah so she totally macam uh you know she she's more err she she literally like uh tries to bother about what I'm doing you know uh getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there tapi uh aku rasa she I don't know whether she realise lah that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing lah so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me lah now err but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months eh we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
yes yes yes rimas rimas is the correct word yes yes I agree I agree
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time ah whenever it I'm the same as you ah mesti kalau macam cakap kan mesti nak menang tau macam in an argument eh kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so I'm always macam energetically fight back tau ah passionate macam fight back tau but nowadays kan macam I I don't know ah kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through uh certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so uh kita macam tak tak uh apa tu there's no more energy to to ah to to expand to to argue tau macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree kan nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer lah you know it's just you know you just you just stop lah just you just don't don't don't speak lah but but it's something that I have always um like macam I I'm really thankful that um she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because err I I knew back then eh I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay lah you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because err dia pergi haji uh last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that uh she came back and err I think I don't know lah maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno tak yang the coklat Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation eh Kinder Bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it is it is that is that oh for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart kan I will I will ah I will be very very uh macam adamant to to keep to my belief style ah so when when I and when I'm that kind eh you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing uh I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in tau
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience lah ya and then apa
I actually find them funny lah it's just like the way they walk lah aku tak boleh dok aku aku kalau tengok dia orang jalan macam gitu kan every time aku tengok like macam it's like eh it's like eh bro your one very big ah bro ya
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for punya apa tu uh yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was uh the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time kan so you ask me to apply for punya apa tu uh opening kan yang yang ala air steward
ya err I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about uh I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like eh come lah just just follow me lah you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat yishun
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat McDonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati lah we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right um the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective tau which which means okay macam let's say for example eh I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand tau kenapa dia macam gitu
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so err and and and it was honestly right my mind ah is always a one track thing so let's say for example kan aku cakap okay I told myself ah I I want to become a pilot but err I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing lah so I I don't have that kind of err presence of mind ah to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
so so my my life in in this industry lah in this aviation industry started out with um with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room uh on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion lah because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight err macam tak err how to say eh uh not hundred percent lah not not not not a six six lah vision lah so uh and at that time kan dia orang very strict kan kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain ah ah tau yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right sebab tu eh they realise eh in err in err eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so dia orang uh they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot tau who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it lah you you no more already lah no more chance right so ah so that was what spurt on my motivation uh and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in uh so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to err err start the flying course ah so that time uh they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents uh fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight ah so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out lah dekat err kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then err they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that lah this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi tau
sekarang ah sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition uh even further because I felt you know ah bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club tau and this was when I was sixteen lah when I was up there it was such a different feeling
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet lah bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing lah that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that lah ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could tapi aku I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics macam science ah science punya subject kan err I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
uh it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time ah I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my uh my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so uh puzzled because did cakap apa tau
uh eh I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics ah but your other topics ah you rabak man you cannot make it why ah then I realise that but it was it was uh uh only way way way later lah then I realise that uh okay I I I actually
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally aku tak boleh bergerak I was just I I and I still remember that day was my uh examination my english paper punya examination and err I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now ah okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it recurred again ya it recurred again so uh that was another dent in my in my in my dreams lah basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi ah punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
err actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat uh jadi err air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up lah how it all times ties back together
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave uh my my apa tu orang panggil
uh I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid uh pakai insurance ah macam my medical insurance ah ya err for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
apa working
ada ada sikit uh my mortgage kan every month is uh one point one K uh aku punya err they cut off aku punya uh eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future lah aku aku aku I was thinking lah anyway that one is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me lah which is why I wanted a bigger place uh the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang ah all my baggage my
eh I don't mind man I really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty jer also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area kan and uh the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's uh it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential punya punya place ah
yes I was there uh okay lah it was it was uh it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is um when you are overseas eh err your how do I put it eh you you're considered as an expat tau so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration lah so that's the reason why um most of us kan kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to uh apply with the local punya okay so right now right now err so okay so so right now what happens is this eh
so uh average lah it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level lah I'm not I'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of uh about four K about there lah about about uh thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign dok we even we even err graduated kita semua dah celebrate seh we went out drinking I mean
ah tak tak tak tak tak I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks lah along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's uh
ya I know right macam nasib kentang kan macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before lah this phrase I know I know
tapi I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining lah you know in in every ya so aku I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to uh goes back on track and all that right uh I I'm pretty sure lah one day lah one day I uh you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it lah
eh it's a different skill set lah sia it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself uh being on the drone so when I see it I was like oh okay ya lah but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do uh uh that's relatable and that's uh you know but I think uh they they have already announced macam plans lah you know
uh they want to push us to become uh flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is uh back to normal again right uh I think you know hopefully lah hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old aku tak boleh ah dok flight tak boleh
yes yes actually you are right you are right I I agree tapi dia dia punya orang he's not a war err what you call it eh he's not those ya he's a very selfish businessman but he's not the type of war mongering you know guy that that
exactly you know he's very divisive lah dia punya talking eh dia punya words eh that he say uh selalu make people uh fight each other
ya but dia punya orang macam tak um dia punya words ah he's words are very unwise and also no wisdom lah I I find that he's very different from obama obama eh when he speaks eh dia punya cakap eh all his words eh um they are very substance tau they have a lot of substance
macam their their their thoughts lah
eh kau ada citizenship eh new zealand uh huh
ya bro that's why you need to bring the entertainment to you that means your home right will be your one stop entertainment okay eh but new zealand mahal ke eh tak mahal kan dia punya standard of living huh
ya but I but no aku rasa it's not that much of uh how do you put it eh macam I I don't know what the currency is like uh the standard of living and the cost of living over there over there but from what I'm seeing eh it seems that everybody is okay leh dia orang macam tak
but the house is not fully paid for macam mana
cannot travel maknanya dia orang
kalau okay let's say macam for example eh kalau nak pergi ah okay ah cannot means the custom cannot clear them
nak kena macam uh in in a advance ah inform them in advance kind of thing ah
asal eh
tapi if you will just the duit bunga kan dia orang panggil duit bunga eh but you you still accumulate apa
correct twenty four per cent dia orang ambil kan they call it apa ah
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this

dia punya fire spark and then tiba-tiba spread all the way dekat lantai so pasal kau human kan kau akan lari apa and then his live was being cut off oh he was doing live ah actually YouTube live
mm ah so he went out the house or room I don't know then dia try to put off the fire back
tak dapat semua ah only sixty percent
yang kat lantai lantai dia uh hilang kan
then bila dia
he saw the thing on fire no the room suddenly sampai
ya you remember that I said the object was like ada smoke coming out
no cause it was during circuit breaker apa
circuit breaker then ramai orang work from home so I was alone in the lab no interns no what
your tempat tinggal
dekat ah satu bus jer kot
apa tu naik one six eight jer
no dia naik one six eight then dia turun dekat jalan kayu kan
mana tahu so it's like a a palm thing sized eh
he kerja malam
kalau aku aku dah keluar seh
kurang ajar seh orang macam gitu ee
tak mahu hidup please
orang tengah kesusahan kau tak tolong eh
kurang ajar sia
today malam ah
is for orang yang buat korban kan not us
perempuan I'm not sure usually lelaki
I mean kalau kau baligh I guess I don't know
kau import
I think they will but restricted takde viewers viewers eh whatever ah ah ah ya ya
go masjid doesn't mean I always do korban what you think I'm that rich ah
no lah aiyo I don't even eat kambing
no ah only eat biryani and tulang merah
that's the only kambing that I eat
actually pada aku tak ah it depends on how you cook actually
no that's why aku very selective with like orang masak kambing kan aku tengok reviews dulu
err so far aku rasa biryani masjid jer yang sedap
you know yang yang kat sekolah kita yes tu from one of the mosques ah I don't know
it's like for four people to eat it in fact sikit jer cause they say girls always waste food
I mean don't blame us ah we finished it clean seh kita minta dua tiga kali
tu pasal seh
eh you are still growing takpe lah
I don't know korang kira the the high ah
tapi kau pernah pakai yang very tall what
ah yang penting aku tak kan
aku pernah pakai flats uh fifty which is what five no wait to
so perempuan eh
uh eh five tinggi tau
kau pernah pakai that time
siapa eh siapa nama dia fatin fatin nadirah

kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit lah
like clearly everyone the whole school is talking about you you know like eh sudah lah I don't have time for all of you
eh tak cause okay cause my relationship was low-key relationship kan of course ah I don't want to expelled what
no maksud aku at that moment
that's different maksud aku low-key is like

I mean K mine was quite interesting I mean err as you know aku kan buat caregiving job kan to my friend so err I mean yesterday I was just resting I mean the day before so of course err
um when it comes to have to my friend need um what I do normally is I go over to his place um I will like um prep him lah and keep him proper and like aku mandikan dia
uh and then dia nak berak and everything so aku dia and everything then aku nak kena siapkan dia so everything took like one hour plus and then after that
err we were waiting for transport because kawan dia nak kena hantar tau hantar dia so we were like one hour late for the appointment so we're supposed to be there by three
but we only managed to get the transport by like three forty five lah almost four lah so lambat lambat lambat gila so by the time we reached err the hospital
err hospital tu somewhere around dekat err in the east
so it was almost four so by the time kita masuk then the the therapists were saying like err one hour lambat and everything lah last standard procedure lah huh but they would just do their best lah because of this COVID nineteen kan
so okay lah I mean it it then after that aku hantar dia balik and then lepas tu bila aku hantar dia balik after that there was guest that came in so the guest happens to be err like err dia punya adik punya wife punya parents
so of course aku nak kena siapkan lah I had to like wipe him err tukar baju dia tukar t-shirt dia and everything so I had to like prep him and then he was dia pun nak makan
dia dah makan err then the the parents of err dia punya err apa tu adik dia punya wife masuk tau into the room
and then it was like so awkward ke tu orang tua aku tak tahu kenapa dengan orang tua but bila dia like when they entered the room aku dah tahu okay this is going to be a very sombre sedih atmosphere
it's kind of betul gang ah they were talking to my friend and then they started to cry aku dah macam ya alah aku cakap no don't cry and then after that the one thing that made me even macam tersentuh sikit lah bila bunyi apa tu
your phone ah kacau jer your phone oh your alarm okay tak apa tak apa so apa tu semantic noise so ah so okay back to my story so lepas tu ah then the the mother lah the mother said to me lah ah nama anak nasri ya
then like mm a'ah cik nama saya nasri dah okay I was feeding my friend right so after that the mum was like nak nak tahu kan anak suap anak suap err err kawan ni anak dapat pahala aku dah macam aku tak tahu apa nak buat do not know how to continue the convo
ya ya ya ya ya and then aku dah macam
ya ya it's true it's true and then aku macam and then err lepas tu err then the mother was like saying err um saya jaga err suami saya dia masuk hospital enam kali then I'm like eh kamu bual err personal story pula kat aku aku dah macam macam mana nak react ah so aku macam then I I try my best
a'ah I tried my best to stay composed lah then after that err aku pun dah macam alamak aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah start nangis then they started to cry aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam no no no no this this cannot dia they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am macam tak boleh I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up macam tersentuh ah and then automatically my air mata will mengalir you know so I was like then I was like quickly err err apa tu kasih suap then after that I just say uh
cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap lah so I went out of the room lah then when I went out the room
and then kau tahu apa you know my mum's friend um
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya kiranya my my friend punya mum
mother lah kirakan ah tak boleh masuk you know inside the room because you see ah
because yang sakit tu anak dia tau so bila so she is and then she's also sakit so when she will feel sedih you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition dia akan nangis
ah yes yes yes that like she feel like macam anak dia akan pergi dulu you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then aku dekat dapur and then the mum would would like tell me lah like like you know err the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say err
tu lah err takde orang lah yang dia kesian you know aku punya kawan macam dia kan sekarang pun yang jaga dia it's like the father and the maid apa the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend lah so macam so sometimes bila dia tak mampu to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first apa because the mother is the priority first apa
so you know at times kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa err dia pun sometimes will say you know like err
puas hati masukkan err dalam ni lah rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already ah and then the mother the mother say lah macam
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like macam golongan really yang orang tua lah
so sometimes bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak react with aku dah macam huh macam mana nak what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like macam err takpe lah cik sabar lah cik cik tahan jer lah
but even the the mum also say lah macam the mum somehow I can feel like the mum macam somehow appreciate aku lah macam akan cakap apa like what you tell me like err
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum macam
the mum really appreciate aku ah the mum macam sometimes I think the mum dia tersentuh lah and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon ah tak silap
because they dia dia orang orang boyan I think boyan ke jawa I think err jawa jawa sorry dia orang orang jawa
the parents are orang jawa so so so nasi rawon is like a big thing lah so I didn't come on the day she masak cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend lah like macam eh aku tak dapat datang ah tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat
so the then the mum said ah tu lah cik masak ah hari tu tapi tu lah err anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang I'm like sorry lah cik K I mean
honestly aku cakap dengan kau
aku kan nak balik kan in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
uh dia automatically dia akan sedih so aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak react then he he say to me lah like hey can you do macam online from here then I'm like huh how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia
I mean after so many years of just macam you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now macam you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time macam kita have that conversation with beberly kan
ah yang kat mcdonald's err like I was very very lost when I was like what umur aku twenty two all the way to twenty seven can you imagine I was lost for almost five years
so so that's why I was like telling myself err when when comes to to my friend lah ya aku tak boleh tolong dia all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to ulang balik come back because of the whole swab test err quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day dia dia pun nak kena redha and I aku pun cakap dengan dia lah macam
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just macam
he always dia dia selalu ingat yang
yang aku jer seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia
then aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia lah macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya cousin setakat cousin aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa
tapi dia dia macam tak lah macam macam err then dia cakap lah yang cousin aku tak take initiative and everything
mum betul betul betul
memang membastard rabak punya
ya I mean I don't know lah err I mean err if I if I want to share you personally then kau macam
err he even ni tau that he gave a certain amount of money to me tau
and the amount is one K with dia kasih aku dia jadi macam sedekah kat aku dia cakap eh err you take lah this money to pay for your semester fees as alhamdulillah but at the end of the day at the same time aku rasa macam
kau tahu macam you are tied down to something that's why aku kalau boleh tak nak macam
I don't want to accept the money lah you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because um dia dah ada ni ah you know sometimes orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat kan
so aku just accept graciously lah and aku and I I I feels that money to pay for my err semester fees err for my err semester lepas
ah ya it feels like an amanah you know so by the but aku pun rasa macam serba salah lah macam need doing kaus eh macam
then dia cakap tak apa tak apa just ambil aku macam alamak macam mana tu but but you see like see aku dah macam you see ah like my my my err university journey like a hamburger lah alhamdulillah I would say that macam err my urusan has been dipermudahkan lah
uh with regards to my semester fees I mean err I have contribution from my late my my late step grandfather my late uncle and then then dia juga ah apa tu contribute to my semester fees
ah rezeki so macam like I say lah like you are tied down to something lah so aku kalau boleh macam
ya and I like somewhat in debt but at the same time aku macam
macam this is my my share lah macam aku kalau boleh tak nak mungkir tau macam because
aku rasa unless you are dedicated to the person and then macam you if you are not dedicated to the person you would not help the person all the way to the extent lah I mean as I do not know of any other person who does the same thing as me I think I'm the only one lah as of now lah
mm betul
betul understood understood I faham faham
kira him selfish lah in one way or another
mm lepas tu
oh macam gitu eh
mm betul
I mean in your situation now of the fact that kau macam you I mean you kau kau agak you are quite
you are in a situation you are in a difficult situation right now lah like like does your family macam help you out do do do they do they like err do they like give their their hand or shout out to you like eh do need help do they even ask you eh syaf kau okay tak
macam mana babe

kecoh ke oh my god this is so macam oh my god
yup betul betul
mean he lost it lah tak dapat
oh your oh macam your father is the macam very the old school punya ni eh
very dominant macam apa tu match up begitu tapi ni lelaki punya
ah kalau old school ya betul betul that's true it's true it's true
mm faham faham faham
mm betul
eh no err not bumi err in syurga syurga
correct correct so your your your sister said your mum said tak nak lah
betul betul to repay him back like you you you guys feel like macam aiyo kenapa aku nak kena kasih dia duit sedangkan time aku besar dia he was never there in your life
mm betul betul
so he he I mean he's I mean not not it's not calculative it's just that he likes to compare and count like that lah in money in belanja
ah faham faham faham
ah faham faham faham
mm faham faham
err dia tak go through apa you and your uh and your other siblings went through the hardship you know nak cari makan and everything and how your mum raise you guys up and everything
eh kau nangis ke kat situ
you haven't kau takde intention nak go onto public sector ke
masuk like teaching I don't know maybe
but untuk I aku rasa macam
err the ones yang err macam study hard apostrophe
will progress kuat juga then the ones yang err tak progress are the ones yang macam mediocre
will just fought out in society aku masih ingat err I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher err he
ah now when I think about him ah when I think about that statement ah about what he made at last time ah aku macam eh you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad ah you you are that ah that
macam his statement ah macam ada sense of macam elitism you know macam macam macam how our err government ah macam gitu that kind of it's like the vibe right there the dia kasih ya
macam very similar to how the government macam how the government is like lah so aku fikir eh you mean apa yang people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are err apa tu content with what they have so
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so um so before I went there in my head I always thought macam able to kan aku nak belajar kat sana then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive lah in the beginning lah or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore kan pakai cambridge kan and sana they have their own system tau ah for apa tu macam for how to grade and grading and everything
and then kat sana aku perasan wah the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart eh we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know macam ones from sabah with the ones from johor
the ones from perak like aku dah aku I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but aku realize about them is what they lack is
they are they are very err examination based kau faham kan exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is macam hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is macam err the examination is err it's it's it's it's very straightforward ah macam uh you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like err those yang macam err critical thinker
is tak banyak tau kat sana
the ones yang critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones yang from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question yang macam critic yang macam higher thinking ah
but because our our education system is dah macam nurture us like this kan but bila when we go there dia orang think yang kita ni super on tau
so aku macam huh super on eh not really leh it's just that uh our just that our culture macam singapore culture has trained us to be like this macam and then some more you have to understand aku kat sana aku pay enam ribu eh
so every hour and every minute tu bagi aku is duit so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like macam when ah so sometimes they they the malaysian kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam
dia orang they are quite intimidated lah even my classmate also told me ah yang the very first time they met me they she feels that I am aku sombong aku arrogant aku cakap eh serious ah
she say ah engkau macam poyo ah aku dah serious ah poyo
ah poyo then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with aku I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my kepala would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior lah because you are overseas mah you're like you need to hustle apa and then then
alhamdulillah I would say that I am coping very well lah I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that aku drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second um
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself err then I was not really focused ah like I still remember like the day before the exam baru aku nak belajar can you imagine
ya yang answer script
ah it's like a macam err I based err meaning ah I I will use the past year exam paper then I will answer the question then most of the time the the questions will will be almost the same ah like every four years is almost the same that's what my one of my friends told me lah ah who has studied in
um ah in semester three I was very low key nak mampus tau aku macam aku every question every every essay that I did I didn't really share with anyone I just kept quiet uh I even like um tak post anything about about me are preparing for exams I just was just very very low key ah
ya and then this coming semester four pun err aku hopefully lah I can get a err very good lah but all in all aku cakap dengan kau I mean
I don't know I don't know lah macam but but you see ah I I remember that time ah aku baru balik dari kedah tau nak balik err pergi tak silap ke singapore uh
then aku dah eh macam mana kau tahu then she say oh I know lah because of your accent and the way you talk
aku dah wow I'm shocked man
talk betul betul betul
eh err you she she's a teacher in a she is she is a graduate from singapore eh tak silap aku eh no no no err no she's a she's a alumni of
but her brother actually err studies in and err did err did her his master in something like that then the brother got married to a singaporean girl err so to cut the story short dia cakap dengan aku lah eh uh you kan orang melayu kenapa you tak stay kat malaysia err I think you should
err take this opportunity to work in malaysia I think you would try you will thrive very well in malaysia then you got me thinking eh apa dia cakap tu maybe there is a certain truth you know because kat sana aku perasan orang melayu wah babe privilege babe
macam privileged gila aku cakap privileged you know
yes yes yes exact bumiputera thing
yes yes betul betul betul then aku cakap lah eh but you know it's not that hard it's not that easy you know cause I am a singaporean malay then err aku cakap dengan dia lah I was very frank with her I told her err you know how kat sini kita
err macam casing kita punya bangsa kan macam tindaskan
err or we are being like extra lah kirakan not extra lah we're just being err we are we we we're looked down
tapi kat sana it's err it's bangsa dia orang yang look down kau faham kan so dia macam terbalik err macam dia err aku cakap dengan very frank ah then dia cakap ya I faham I faham tapi tapi aku rasa sana pun dia dia rakyat is not
I mean is a very hustle and bustle city lah but the expenses there is mahal nak mampus
I find like macam barang-barang dah macam barang-barang the shampoo body shower oh wah I tell you mahal sangat macam satu
one body shower macam dove eh twenty four ringgit eh siala twenty four ringgit when you pay when you pay fifty ringgit to pay for the twenty four ringgit and when you left with that balance eh macam kiwak macam eh this is very expensive leh but when in singapore
when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot kan then it's like worth it kan padahal it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether
I always thought like macam is quite cheap aku I when I go over to like macam kedah I go penang wah it's even cheaper sia barang-barang dia then I'm like I'm quite shocked lah in one way or another
and then err I mean I always got teased off lah I always got teased yang eh err by my classmate eh kau tak nak kahwin ke dengan orang malaysia
aku macam ah kahwin orang malaysia kau tahu tak aku punya preference apa
no I'm serious I mean I I have I have this classmate she's orang johor you know so she dia macam dia macam merajuk you know dengan aku because aku macam friend zone dia
no no no that one is another girl that one is another class that one is another department err that one is err sastera that one is my my my own classmate lah and then macam macam mana aku tak friend zone dia babe dia
dia she's from okay dia not very the feminine kind of girl oh dia macam very kasar then dia suara very loud and then dia very macam err like you you can sense a presence you know and then she's very she participate in every college activities
and then aku kalau aku betul-betul nak menghala kepada
ke jalan yang lurus and then my choice of girl is somewhat very feminine you know macam honestly like ya ya ya I mean yang orang yang pakai tudung yang very very very manis to look at I don't know ah that is my kind of preference ah when it comes to
ah sia aku macam siala I mean
ah syak kurang ajar lah tak lah but I don't know I mean I don't know you never know what you never know err our future like who knows maybe kau one day get married or aku one day get married you'll never know
but but innocence that macam aku punya preference when comes to I have I have a type of of of of lady of or a girl and yang aku suka lah and my preference is macam yang putih yang dia no need no dia tak perlu putih sangat it's just putih dia pakai tudung ke very very typically uh
eh aku tak hitam kita sawo kita sawo matang kulit kita is sawo matang
sawo matang tanned tanned sawo matang
so err ya so and then kurang ajar tak lah hitam is hitam and then after that um then aku kat sana aku kan macam abang-abang aku kan macam abang-abang singapore kan
ah ya ya ya you know my suara is always like hello
and then lagi suara aku ah my my voice will bounce apa whenever I use the mic when it comes to presentation err in lecture hall
so macam I'm known as the suara abang-abang lah but then dia orang tak tahu lah they akan close all
no I'm serious ah no aku dah macam aku cakap dengan kau aku macam double lives ah kat sana you know like
in school I am like quite err the abang-abang but
ah eh babe do you know that aku that time menang err did I did I show you a picture that I aku menang err prince of the night you know for for an event
macam ah so I I won like a prom kingish punya competition
I know it sounds crazy aku pun tak sangka and I was the host emcee for the event and and the judge was my lecturer so what he he he actually chose me as the prom king err or the prince of the night aku dah huh apa ni
no because um he chose me because I was I was one of the I was ultimately I was the only one who dressed very well that night aku ah because I was wearing blazer
ah ya I was I was wearing blazer then I bought this like yellow punya macam like a macam like a apa tu belt ke apa dah apa-apa lah and then I yellow err
I think ada I pun nak tunjuk you guys ah then so I was quite shocked lah so
so like err like err like I tell you like I I feel like I'm living a double life macam kat kat sekolah aku macam very quiet quiet baik-baik but
but at the same time aku aku kan quite wild kan like you know the number of people aku met aku err make friends with babe by in instagram by in facebook I'm still making friends up to today
I mean it's called networking lah although kawan aku yang kat singapore ni tak err I have I aku tak pernah disclose anything about it to do you know even that time I post err something about me going to kedah in my instagram

so macam ah you don't have to tell the other like I don't have to tell my friend lah because it's my prerogative apa
ya this my acts also apa so but
so I was like telling myself oh no no tak boleh aku dah I I cannot post this kind of err this kind of post anymore because he will be triggered eh ni nama ni triggered dia triggered gila dia triggered lepas tu dia triggered lepas tu dia start questioning me lah macam kau pergi dengan siapa and everything lepas tu dia dah start
ya then dia macam sedih lah dia dah sedih and everything aku dah eh siala ni member nak sedih
engkau ah kalau you see eh if you are sakit kau tak payah fikir tau benda begini you don't even have to think about all these all you think is about your preparation to meet
siap aku cakap dengan kau ah aku pun sometimes pun macam bila dia nak macam err intimate dengan aku aku sometimes pun I tried to elak you know because
berdosa kan kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam add onto ke fill onto his desire dia memang ada desire tu kita tak menafikan everyone has desire desire
but kena control lah aku pun cakap dengan dia eh you control lah you tak boleh terlalu on sangat leh because you never know ah in any bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat or kita tengah intimate sekali err tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila
in that kind of state ke you know because it's he's in that kind of that state state and then he's like he's super sensitive I mean at the end of the day in every situation err kalau tuhan nak tarik nyawa kau people err god would just take away your nyawa lah understood I mean
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies kita pun lagi tiga minute correct kalau you berapa minit babe kat situ
okay so aku pun tengah trying to keep up lah with my studies I mean I'm left with just err semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia lah unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so err I did ask macam consulted over there lah like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like macam temporary contract eh
so aku tak nak ambil contract I aku rasa it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that kau kena cari err rumah then on top of that kau kena settle your visa and all those shenanigans so aku cakap no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
but you see ah the thing is I aku because I'm here mah so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so kalau kalau if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network lah and the end of the day aku pun tak sure lah what kind of err prospects I want to do
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the um I mean that's that's the thing that aku aku don't mind doing lah but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
punya sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe err
err take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day err in language pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa unless you are really passionate and interested in it lah
ah what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best lah but I'm just glad that my study punya period is going to be be done and over with very very soon
then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
foodpanda dah takde agaknya asal nak

mm dia sebenarnya dia series macam wentworth gitu tapi dia main kat macam dia filem dua jam kelakar pasal series tu ada enam episode
ha cerita dia kalau nak tahu pasal bunuh-bunuh dia ada nicole kidman tapi bagus ah dia dia thriller cerita dia ah okay lah cerita sikit eh nicole kidman ni dia sebenarnya psychiatrist suami dia doctor untuk cancer uh untuk budak-budak so kirakan dia orang dua ni kaya ah lepas tu anak dia orang sekolah atas high satu hari tu ada budak baru masuk sekolah pakai scholarship budak tu bangsa sepanyol
jadi mak dia jadi kawan dengan nicole pasal
anak nicole pun sekolah situ kira macam antara dua darjat ah yang sepanyol tu miskin si nicole ni kaya pendekkan cerita
perempuan sepanyol tu kena bunuh teka siapa dia punya suspect
suami si nicole padahal nicole seorang jer kawan dengan dia
pasal si suami nicole tu ada affair dengan si sepanyol ni
tak habis tengok jadi kita tengok sendiri series tu uh pasal tu potong-potong so tak tahu lah apa jadi takde nak kena tengok online ah dia main kat jer so nak kena stream ah
uh patut tadi keluar habis hujan lebat gila
mm besok mungkin uh nak pergi uh beli beras tengok ah macam mana makan kat luar ah
uh belum tahu tengok cuaca
uh dia pergi memancing oh tapi tak jadi tak tahu ah tadi dia pergi tadi dia dah siap-siap tau lepas tu dia dia keluar lepas tu kejap lagi dia masuk balik lepas tu dia cakap uh gerimis lepas tu dia taruh balik the barang-barang pancing dia lepas tu kejap lagi dia duduk kat kerusi so tak jadi lah tu sebab tu dia kat situ
dia hantar kat kedai omar tadi uh uh petang tengah hari
a'ah sebelum hujan
cuci carburetor jer
oh full service dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri huh
ah tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah pass two A kan so dia nak bawa motor tu kan
uh ya by the way kan tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas uh actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee tau it's a good deal macam you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
ah see how lah if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers ke or I will buy the cinema vouchers
so dia punya is testing so so maksudnya dia uh
oh okay okay so kalau kalau nak apply macam uh position apa yang most slightly akan take your cert take uh takes graduates
rovers okay then kalau uh uh how macam mana boleh pakai cert tu untuk apply kalau boleh jadi apa
uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh

pasal kadang-kadang orang suka tengok ngaji tengok ngaji jer you know what I mean umi kalau nak umi tak nak kalau selain melainkan kalau umi dato aliff ke dato vida nak tunjuk kehidupan takde orang kisah pasal umi kehidupan
so kalau umi nak buat channel umi buat satu satu topic tu satu niche umi boleh buat macam kesihatan ada orang buat macam err buat duit anything lah okay lah okay contoh eh contoh contoh let's just pakai contoh orang lain
okay um kita tengok channel channel orang lain eh kita tengok berapa banyak dia buat okay contoh um channel siapa siapa yang ustaz ustaz apa ustaz kazim

okay lapan ratus enam puluh satu ribu kan subscriber
okay okay lah ni ni anggaran jer dia buat dalam three point two K per month okay tapi the thing is benda ni kadang-kadang dia anggarkan jer it might not be true macam sometimes dia boleh buat lagi banyak lah you don't know okay lah let's tengok macam channel um celebrity eh
siapa ah siapa yang buat channel err okay lah aliff aliff syukri okay dia suka buat youtube kan
okay jer bonda rozita
um ni bumi ratu channel okay ni jer
okay dia buat dalam empat ribu lima ribu lah okay per month

okay err kan dia okay terlajak laris ni dia banyak tau dia punya
okay dia dia punya video banyak okay tengok eh dia punya langganan langganan berapa okay satu point empat satu juta okay dia punya upload dah seribu lebih ah video dia dia dia naik kan okay um and then dia punya view dah banyak dia tiga ratus lebih pasal dato aliff ni dulu dia bila dia start tak banyak orang tengok lama-lama kan banyak orang tengok jadi
okay dia daripada malaysia okay um dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan yes so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit lah tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
I mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing jer buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji lah I'm doing this I'm doing this for your ngaji no lah remember I take video for your masak that one I haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh lah cuma um tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok I don't know lah maybe like very slow lah kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat lah kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang kan umi nak buat kan untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni episodenya okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain lah I don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that um
ya but kalau umi buat ni umi kena consistent lah umi tak boleh buat macam
ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi kan orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh ah tapi sekarang I think better you buat macam video yang
um boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji um
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better lah
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti lah nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji kan I mean it's on they got all the sheikh sheikh all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now lah now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh mm ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that
lepas tu ya lah that that's what you can do and then you can do a lot of things

it's called sekali gus
ya because if a goose goes out and buy things and carry everything in one trip it's called sekali gus
I have never seen where mister teh tarik is at jurong
like banyak banyak
that one thing you did lunch time right banyak banyak kan
it's still rezeki
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one lah down there right and then after that rina uh uh recently only um enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing lah but you think hanisah is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not lah but it's not worth it I think it's very bodoh
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti
a'ah during that time you will see in the you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also nakal ah but the girl quite angel ah tapi macam devil lah kan but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible lah
and my mum says that my my dad is zouk so kedekut
I don't want they they even like when I was growing up you know through my years they ajak me go there also I don't want you know
nampak lah
and then my mum was like and then my mum was like kau jangan kurang ajar eh
no lah dekat at the shop or what
kenapa you nak pergi sana
kenapa you think that it's a macam
macam fishy fishy stuff you know
it's cold and you uh tak tahan sejuk you know tak tahan sejuk
so you are you are telling me that kita kena shop before kita pergi korea
I the the thing is that I want to go there sebab I've been there
it's a place whereby I rasa macam
tempat ini bagus untuk bawa partner ah you know
I don't know kalau if there
they have mukshidonna there tapi
I'm not sure if you can apa
sebab kalau you nak shopping dekat sana
bawa benda bring light pack light lah you know
confirm berat
I wanna go there when it's winter tapi
I'm just afraid that kalau
you know lah kita tak tahan sejuk
I tak tahan but you know
I tak I I tak pernah experience snow you know so
mana balik singapore demam if kalau dekat sana dah sejuk obviously you
tak shiok
tak shiok lah siapa nak nak nak fall sick in on holiday seh
but I think you'll like it there lah sebab apa eh
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you pakai lah brand brand itu semua sebab
macam etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream dengan face masks very cheap there
but banyak banyak
dekat sana lebih murah lah compared to you sini ah
we concentrate on korea dulu ah apa cakap australia
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like macam
a road trip tau you know like macam you know melbourne eh like from sydney we drive down to other places

scenery twelve apostle's yang dia orang tengok itu semua
another five years I rasa sebab nak kira-kira plan dua tahun
I dengar husband dia tengah ambil
provided provided if dia masih single lah kalau dia nak kahwin might
by then dah ada anak [kan]
like for me korea I've been there so I bring you to the places that I've been there or maybe to new places that kita yang dapat tahu
I want to try actually but then I don't think it's right lah macam tak
tak boleh ah it's not halal what it's live you cannot eat that
is expensive tapi kalau if you are there you tak buat
kira macam wasted lah you dah dekat sana you dah dah all the way sampai korea abeh you tak
not just crab ah can buy lobster or ketam what
it's it's best to just splurge ah sebab dah dekat sana apa
how to play ini huh
but then I think korea tak ada korean theme park tak ada haunted house lah
I try to find macam
kalau saturday macam pergi sentosa

I support no I support the idea of you nak jual
itu mask daripada you nak beli and shortlist semua benda
kalau you buy the mask I will pay for you
tak akan you
makan is because makanan dia they are selling at thirty dollars
no that's why I say you must group the order let's say macam three for eleven dollars
mahal tau you tahu kenapa tak
kalau you tengok
you tengok services of uh delivery services eh like
so berapa
but I think for the start you just buy fifty dulu ah
macam very
macam loud loud colours macam orang might think twice ah nak beli unless it's an occasion ah macam
I nikah pakai itu apa
table dah empat
your mum dah masak
okay jangan berbual dekat sini
but ya lah I have that urge to makan mamak but then again
but adam road mana got
adam road like macam boring ah
yes ada spring leaf

eh that time dekat rumah orang
landed property that time we go itu apa spring leaf is it
you bring me there malam-malam lah landed property

there's one video that shows that uh satu okay there's two video ah after dengan before ah there's this two cat before video
ada dua kucing then
so yang cat itu the other cat is he keeps looking for dia punya partner

ya aku tengok
aku tengok aku lebih suka tengok attack on titans lah but
err if I'm not wrong suka demon slayer over it cause I don't know why but like okay lah I see I watch both demon slayer also not bad lah

the number of cases tak naik
kalau naik yang sekarang pun dah restrict ke apa kan macam dah tiada orang kena kan
bagus lah sia bagus ah
wah kita ada dua minit lagi whoa macam nak end podcast macam tu lah eh macam mana orang end podcast ada intro music eh
eh tak boleh gitu kau fikir apa senang sangat kerja ni
bro countdown tu apa new years new year gitu lah eh
kita orang berbulal jer like relax relax jer eh
so dia orang like um
dia orang want to dia orang exit already tapi dia orang nak masuk balik so when they want to masuk balik and then like the security guard stop them lah
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but dia orang like um
they insisted coming in lah and then lepas tu they block the way and then this security guard was like um he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched lah lepas tu dia
lepas tu dia punya couple tak happy lah habis tu dia orang um so like the security guard
lepas tu dia cakap oh like I nak pergi beli uh I nak pergi ambil allen key
ah dia nak pergi ambil allen key lah daripada dia punya service counter lepas tu um
after they take the like they want to take the allen key lepas tu dia cakap eh err please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's dia orang punya pasal lah
err when when they left I ask this security guard lah like you know um like tak kisah pasal dia orang lah sebab dia orang um they they were trying to be difficult lah because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so lepas tu another security guard datang lepas tu dia cakap oh err this couple lah they have a problem lah they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark lah why why
why um why do you err err how did he touch in the first place lepas tu
dia dah cakap lepas tu they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer lah
lepas tu there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
eh tak boleh cakap nama dia
tak boleh cakap nama store
tapi like you are not supposed to eat there lah because
takut you expose yourself to
ya lah lepas tu dia argued dia cakap oh my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
lepas tu we're like no
jadi dia cakap lor you know like um
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down kat rumah and then like melepak tengok tengok youtube macam my bapa so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
oh like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like pahala I'm like sometimes kan you buat kerja bukan pasal pahala you nak buat kerja pasal you nak care for the person you know
lepas tu you tengah cleaning buntut lagi
you nangis
ya lah tapi you nangis ke tak
macam you kasih birth to anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu kind of thing
wow nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa tau
you tahu kenapa tak pasal I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so kalau you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
tapi like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things macam even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like oh I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop lah or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like memang like I think it's just human nature lah like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
tu memang dah macam amanah lah pasal dia sedekah gaji itu kan
mm alhamdulillah banyak rezeki
you macam apa tu um in debts lah
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like kalau is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like um
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean macam like bila dia dia dah nak meninggal kan habis you ada kat sana
tapi at the same time meh pasal dia punya selfish thoughts macam begitu he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like bila dia dah meninggal like you have to live your life and his ah if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to jaga dia bila masa you nak you nak belajar
lagipun dia ada banyak family around here daddy is swag
correct because I mean I understand lah kalau you ada family kan tapi tak close dengan family tu macam like saudara saudara tak tak rapat kan
tapi like um in terms of helping right ya lah like that lah but like like you just have to help your family lah you know
like my um my side of the family is like kalau ada kerja kahwin or kenduri right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup lah blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
lepas tu like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point kan they will like going to get married soon they'll like eh nanti bila kita kahwin uh
kau orang suka tolong-tolong kan nanti kita err kita kahwin kau orang tolong ah this kind of things it's like
I don't think that's how you should behave lah because then you see the core of your personality you know lepas tu like this particular cousins they are like always
ah even when there is a wedding they tak datang on time dia orang datang lambat even the people that they're supposedly close to ah like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin pun datang lambat so I feel like ni apa punya attitude ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin and they're going to breed this kind of
job but err my step mum ada lah tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak then I'm like ya cukup cukup cukup
tapi like I told you before right like my father memang apa macam babi like you know like he fucking like um tengok
tengok youtube every single day pukul
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to mengaji then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that ustazah he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I ustazah say lah like like you know like
err perlahan-perlahan lah baca lah kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau err perlu err ulang lah lagi tapi I cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main video saya tak boleh concentrate lepas tu ustazah macam awkward lah macam oh okay
for me right my my bapa is
macam pemalas jer gila babi tau
like satu dia like dah lama tak kerja and he's just err waiting for government to give him money
and then like um err what do you call that like dia tengok youtube videos every single day pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh on kuat-kuat until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
um electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar
dia tak nak kerja then um ya then I just keep quiet lah like it's your problem what I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever lah you know
err he got his heartbroken and dia dia nak console lah kawan dia lah
lepas tu kawan dia punya crush
err slept with eh will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me lah I like dia tu bukan you punya girlfriend couple dia punya crush sahaja you you nak sad sad lepas tu you nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam
you nak um act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
lepas tu my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that uh oh kawan dia actually kaya dia macam from a well to do family lah lah lah lah
do you know what my father say he say um oh jadi kalau kalau adik kalau um pergi keluar dengan dia eh nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja coke ke apa ke
lepas tu macam mana you tak darah up kan so I darah up I cakap
kalau nak kalau nak ah jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap
err dia cakap dia macam nak weekend excuse lah macam dia joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
lepas tu what the
ya I mean like fuck man like dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak my father lah dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia lah pemalas
put clothes in the the washing machine and then err gantung which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like kerja um kemas rumah masak lipat baju makingkan dia kopi
I mean mm tapi kalau you old school kan you kerja apa
jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi tau and then I even have like I'm working with a guy um this pakcik he's about seventy plus seventy two
dia masih kerja I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty lah this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to macam kasih dia duit you know what you mean lepas tu I tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab I tengok dia unproductive I rasa macam beban tau like
oh kakak you know err we were talking about how when you die right and then um um
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the bumi right
my step mum cakap dia tak nak jumpa my bapa
ya lah so in bumi you ada mark like husband and wife right tapi in syurga you nak you you still want to be together or not
ah my mum say tak nak myself say
I can see sometimes he's caring but ah as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that macam became geram became macam kau dah lah pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau also nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa
lagipun right half of our lives he never raise us and huh correct dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak expect kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke correct
I mean we don't think like that lah tapi my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap oh nanti err ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit
ya so for me right usually kalau I nak kasih I kasih my step mum lebih macam say
he also likes to count people's money mm macam dia cakap oh like your sister mm dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua like berapa ribu lah
lepas tu he like to compare oh kalau your sister kerja dekat singapore the versus your err brother-in-law who's who kerja dekat malaysia dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that sekarang can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying err meaning macam actually bila kasih I duit macam gitu
like itu yang kasih you marah because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident lah but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right jadi um my step mum yang yang he was refusing to give
because he like calculative say oh you from the kampung you indonesian lah blah blah blah balik kau punya kampung blah blah blah blah blah blah kalau aku tak kahwin kau
like you punya life tak better lah blah blah blah blah
macam gitu sampai sekarang tau dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran kan I tak suka
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you tak nak you nak duit delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother pun macam I rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam my bapa tau like dia selalu dia cakap mm
lepas tu me and my eldest sister we're like kau boleh born dalam poor family tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya problem
allah dah kasih kau banyak avenue untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak blame orang lain
and like err play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged eh and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that jadi I feel like wah kenapa eh like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
tak tak tak I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
so macam I don't know man it's like
tapi sector macam mana
I tak boleh I teach drama and english before
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like oh I'm just contend with sederhana which I cannot relate to
poyo siol
yang you yang you yang you what um apa tu err this this answer thing is it like um it's like a notes for the exam lah
but I would say it's because of err bumiputera but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay mm there's a difference
it's cheap what you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people lah like I tell you before right macam kalau you nak beli benda sana kalau you tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana
I keluarkan lima puluh ringgit I bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk shampoo is tak memadai it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
dia tu yang yang itu lah yang err text you yang tanya is you
ah kau memang dasar orang melayu
kau yang babi eh nak orang putih padahal kau hitam babi
sawo matang oh okay
mm kan you punya suara kan macam abang-abang pun
macam apa number one candidate untuk orang kahwin lah
ah you tak bilang
eh tu tak fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people
ah nanti you you tunjuk I ada gambar
tapi you tapi you
pergi keluar dengan kawan right like another guy right
kita jadi in ah kita jadi in pasal kita use triggered jadi budak kecil
ah tiga minute lah
tapi um I feel that kalau you excel very real like you will be like top top one top five percent maybe they can offer you like uh there are some companies would like sought you out you know then like um give you accommodation and all that and then get you to stay there to work for them
tapi um
no lah why dia tak marah lah tak tak lama pun kita tunggu like just maybe I think kita sampai about
I think two fifteen then we also understand that it was raining then I also tak kasi you the address right I forgot I didn't give you the address
no I'm sorry I tak kasi you the address
eh you ada assignment is it
then suruh jer lah dia teman you lunch ah
so now he's still marah
then jumpa lah dia accompany you belajar like go to err Starbucks or something
ya I like to go Starbucks dekat buona vista you know that Starbucks
cause tadi tadi we went to do the simulator
ah the simulator is very fast I think around macam twenty minutes gitu
ya it's it's damn stupid the simulator is damn bodoh like you ugh you should go for the simulator it's so it's such a waste of time they just wanna take your money that's all
ya but I think this sekarang two B nak kena ambil simulator kan
then oh then the apa</malay>[ah] time simulator tu they there was one part uh we were riding kononnya under the influence of alcohol
ah ya so stupid so dia nya screen dia macam
ya like fuzzy but still tiba-tiba the car on the right swerve into our lane then become our fault they say oh this is what happens when you driving under err influence of alcohol you cannot predict err accident
ya ya that's why suddenly you know the car swerve into our into our lane then I got I got a macam flashback of my accident that time yang time chinese new year
orh the parents asyik suruh kita balik like oh ah kita masakkan ni kita masakkan tu then kau balik lah makan kalau kau tak nak balik then kita tak buat kan you know that kind of thing
then you will rasa like feel bad what
I macam tak nak go home for dinner
oh my god hari-hari I makan benda sama babe kat rumah like it's always ah ada telur ada ikan ada prawn and it's like that every single
simon suka apa
my mum's today because every week week then we balik sana right so sometimes dia makan sana then I balik I tak makan
like balik bishan then I tak makan then macam I feel bad lah cause
ya then simon also kadang don't eat at my parent's but most of the time he will come home and eat at my place then he will balik and then he will eat again so that's why he become fat already
ada exam soon is it
four modules ya four modules is quite heavy though considering you ada full time job and
he he tak he's not studying right he's just working kan
oh so he expects macam the same the same thing lah
oh gitu but lain what
is baru tujuh minit seh
ya I think dalam tujuh tujuh minit gitu
mmhmm tapi kita hang out kita berbual pasal you know like tu
I mean I'll okay jer kalau nak berbual pasal you know
then sekolah is like um two point five years
anything happens and then I ada sekolah or then I also nak cari kerja what
ya I already like send out resumes and stuff tapi most tak get back
I apply for macam dental assistant like reception slash dental assistant and then there's also uh patient service associate
apa lagi I apply for reception uh
because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never
macam eat into the weekends unless uh on course or he ada duty ah then those are the times when it will eat into his weekends
ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know
sungei gedong you tahu um kubur sana
like pusaraman
ya lim chu kang but lagi dalam
ah my house is very near to his workplace tapi takkan I nak duduk sana lima hari kan
oh my god no dia takkan kasi punya girl
she won't lah dia tak kasi punya lah dia tak kasi lah my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
ya and then uh he cakap um nak kena tunggu dia habis tour dia baru
err he will maybe pergi nee soon camp then it will be closer to his workplace already eh I mean his house tapi
ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product

even simon like I say lah simon yang tak pernah ada opinion on someone pun he cakap to me lah
I ada I tanya kenapa you cakap gitu
then dia just cakap oh err entah just from the way he berbual and like
err interact with people he was very nice lah he was very open he say then he feels macam aqil boleh take care of you

kenapa but I feel like it won't be so much of an issue though
ya tapi takkan al-fatihah pun dia tak tahu
tapi it's it's not ah macam mana nak cakap eh it's not so difficult as
I mean if aqil is uh willing to work towards that I don't think it'll be much of an issue ah like he yang willingly nak try for try to do it you know instead of err dia buat macam gini sebab your parents macam suruh or dia buat macam gini just to impress your parents I think macam this kind of thing at the end of the day I guess it will affect you
parents semua gitu what even my mum pun macam gitu what
like even until now I dah kahwin pun dia cakap macam ah ni ni lah like the partner that you chose you know
siapa my mum
no lah entah eh she knows I have my own perangai he has his own perangai also macam when we quarrel or apa

it's it's not getah it's not that strong but it's just there
but the others are nice dia punya chocolate dia punya nutella wah the chocolate I don't think they use like nutella I think they use ganache and the ganache is so damn nice
five five ke six dollars
but it's very muai
ai-suka eh they accept petang tau petang if got slot take it lor the platter wah the platter
it's very muai
abeh you can either choose to put seaweed atau bonito flakes
eh I want go east village jom ah let's go east village
weh it's worth it's worth it dia punya dia punya
but the outer crunch no it's really savoury dia punya filling is savoury
and then dia punya outer layer the the puff
eh is it is it east village juga Boms and Buns is it also at east village
eh don't ah my mum make ayam masak merah I haven't eat eh I haven't taste dude
the apa budae jjigae eh the tofu soup eh the tofu soup muai I love it I love it but
bro dia punya pedas
my mum and me right no okay so the one that I usually buy like some days it's really macam we can tahan cause I eat at bedok at bedok before
with aini when I was finding your birthday present tu tak pedas it wasn't spicy at all
but when I order kat rumah
it's like they add cili padi eh
dekat ah
marah pe
is it ada jual dekat your house area
okay so after that the third year engkau move out because with your aunty and then
ya but is it your own your own punya feeling or memang they are the one who gave you hints
tapi when you go back that time uh like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
ya ya but you and her now dah okay lah
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree lah you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life lah mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy lah you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my nakal my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school lah they get into they they start to steal from shop lah that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument ah so aku suka jawab jer you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum lah you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course lah you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you lah you know you ended up becoming a fight often ah but for our case is not religious matters lah for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche lah because she was a single mother for awhile
ah so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so macam ah ya ya so I can understand her stress ah she was the old school hard knocks kind lah you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind lah if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness lah so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and um I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
ah when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two err I stayed at uh you know those government rental house ya I I stayed uh using uh someone's name lah ya because that person had was sick so she uh the nenek like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus lah ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely lah I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area uh my my house was at outram there the old school jalan kukoh lah you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better ah
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot lah and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay uh when when I was in my early twenties kita actually nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah so by right we already moved to yishun way back already tau but then err this err it's a it's a chinese family lah so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house ah so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room lah my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us lah but you can feel lah after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like rimas if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate lah then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you lah the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight lah like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve tau but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her alah she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke you know
passionate ah kira defensive ah
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example lah uh you know like how sometimes people um okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very nya one the nya one ah actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before ah wah sometimes when people in the level of managerial position ah are sometimes very guai lan you know bro dia orang
ya lah but no lah I truly mean it empathise lah kau jangan ketawa now you make me feel bad for laughing
eh but dude I thought all this while memang you were actually very motivated to be a pilot what no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about macam mana kau jadi pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid tau not the interest tau the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
oo sayangnya
eh no lah because new house you say you use mah you don't have to cash contribute what ada how much
eh but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know nasib kentang eh like like first okay lah the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID pula happen like wow
your nasib is so kentang lah dude
nasib kau sangat kentang bro I don't know why I say kentang ah but I feel like it sounds right nasib kau kentang
another ujian
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to salihin ni edwin jadi nyanyuk ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there orang yang dalam asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you siol lah funny sia
siol ah kau
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story lah I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist ah so she's like a old lady lah you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage lah like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just macam smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing what you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you kena arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you kena arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing lah as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see lah
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand mah so aku anytime can just like you know eh
he's a new zealander but sekarang he stay in australia
no it's not about mahal bro even if it's not mahal you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand macam mana if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example lah like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and um I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say oh my house will kena tarik they will say oh I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
the only reason how they can tarik your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house kena tarik not true okay number two uh you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy uh I give you one one scenario lah one of one of this person oh like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount lah so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
because your will still cut mah bulan-bulan for the house ah okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you ah bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years lah depending on the amount that you have to pay err so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that one right they are the people like ah fuck it lah I don't want to pay aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat ah so if they never pay then they cannot travel
but it's not like so long in advance pun you know it's just like a day probably you know ah but the thing is people thought oh cannot that kind of thing
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will tambah balik one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario lah so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay lah let's say you you a newly married couple lah okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans mah
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay habis kan another thing kan macam the second way let's say macam the minimum eh some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the susu pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come lah lawyer letter come lah
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic ah this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see lah they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country lah ah so ah normally they have their debt consolidation plan lah that debt management program lah all these thing lah this is by the by the banks lah of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria lah you know you are eh aku rasa dah habis ah bro okay lah five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done ah okay
it became forty minutes what the hell and then I like sesat sia I was like so I was so stressed I scared simon angry cause I make I always make him wait
like what if he marah at me and he doesn't want to hang out with us anymore
uh he's kinda mad at me about that like merajuk he merajuk he kata
like cause during the weekends err weekdays tak dapat jumpa then weekend also like I also busy
we were hang up till five and then uh I went home and then I woke up at like twelve then I called him and ask him if he wanted to come along and he say ya he wants to come along but he says but he's like half-awake so I was like never mind lah you just sleep I'll go with sharinah and simon and then after that I tell him lah then after that I want to do my school stuff abeh he macam like upset
then I also macam like annoyed lah pasal he yesterday he cakap he nak hantar you know like he want to fetch me and send me here like and then last minute he say like last minute he like still sleeping then I like ah fuck it lah I'm just going go myself then I don't know so that was a bad start to the day
no lah I tell him already I I sampai then he never reply
oh oh there's one the nice one the one the dua tingkat right
what's what does simon want to do nak buat apa
then you kena tunggu ah how long was the simulation
ah that's not bad tak tunggu lama ah
I mean even when you're not influenced even if you're not drunk tak mabuk you still cannot predict what that's so funny
cause they already like nak masakkan you then is that it
you makan apa seh kat situ azizi still got
he buncit already meh
ah pasal dia punya percentage for exams is the they um turunkan for exams so they put it at every other uh like assignments quizzes so they increase the percentage there so it's heavier for the assignment than quizzes it used to be like five percent now the quizzes are like ten percent that's whole grade leh babe
so like I have to do properly lah then I taking I taking four modules sia babe like fucking busy I'm so sorry for saying that word but but I'll be so busy tak ada time
ya so I'm telling aqil like I'm gonna be busy I tak ada time for him sometimes like for during the weekdays
he gets it tapi dia pun sedih ah sometimes
ah dia macam kalau I boleh buat you pun boleh buat gitu ah
ya I think gitu ah
lain ah lain I cannot sia like he that time he also he only one module lah then I got four modules
cause the other day he was asking me eh err do you have lobang for like then it's like aiya syrinah boleh cari sendiri ah but like you know the previous place I worked at the dyslexia association of singapore they they paying quite high oh now lah
ya it's macam learning centre punya timing ah but it's lepak ah the job is it's damn lepak
no babe it will like strain your body sia then you want to have baby camne nak have a baby if you're gonna be tired all the time
then you can just hantar him lah
tinggal mana seh babe
that's so freaking far from dari bishan pergi choa chu eh pergi his ah camp is kat mana
like you beg her that's what I would do I would pujuk her I'll cium her kaki sia to kasi the bilik
it's like girl I'll get you an iphone and ipad anything you want just let me have the room five days a week you just live in the hall for five days a week a few nights a week and then on the weekends you can have it wah susah sia tak ada rumah sendiri I swear it's damn hard
wah then must tahan like this for satu tahun
no wonder simon kata want to get his own car the other day
it's not cheap sia babe tu hari I tolong top up kan aqil punya minyak cause he was driving me around so I offered to bayar for the minyak ah I only kasi fifty dollars and it's like
what the hell it's so mahal sia their minyak the fuel consumptions is like shit
it's mahal as shit man I swear it's like honestly bike
like I I tengok also if like
and it's all the way at the lim chu kang there sia what bus will pergi sana
tak payah lah oh my god you know what I think right it's a good thing that you're not working right now because you can like hantar simon
sleep in or you know not the one to trouble you but kesian sia he he like I also will think like
but it's only like um august september october november lima lima bulan jer tinggal then after that you guys can like like breathe a little right
the doa the berkat the berkat from the family like you know like another I don't know lah to me doesn't matter as long as got I don't need my makciknya berkat it's okay god sees me and god loves me so that's fine
I feel like as long as ya I feel like if you're pregnant tak yah sudah it's like forgo the whole idea but since you're not pregnant you know planning planning
right so are they agreeable to return you the duit after kalau in december tak boleh hold a wedding are they going to return the money
but that like dengki sia
oh masih tu ah
I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything tau you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to uh and then you also include like you you um macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how sia you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects lah like you still going to lose money sia
and at this time leh macam
macam like you lost thousands of money eh just because like orh the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
it's not even your fault sia it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been uh how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
I told aqil I had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin ah but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time ah cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi I tak nak macam okay I need to find a man yang I boleh kahwin no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will uh fall into place lah like if if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately I feel like uh it's important that aqil and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting ah of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan ah
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi um
so he say ah like let's celebrate or officiate um hujung tahun
tapi kan babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I nak tengok your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all ugh in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
oh right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I macam oh then he cakap ah actually dia dah start saving like he's very uh thrifty like
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
then I was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish I um
I know like I know he's an adult like I know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
so like I was so sure of hassan ah I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him oh my god okay I nak bilang you something ah yesterday yesterday semalam I told aqil this I say I cakap dengan aqil um
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things um tertulis ah lah like is everything tertulis what like
belum I belum delete I still I still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa I tak tahu I tak tahu asal I tak delete
I I tak nak tengok ah the gambar-gambar like it makes
kau nak but
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
lepas tu um dah kahwin after a few after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
cakap melayu lah okay so itu saja tentang hassan
ah tentang hassan dan aqil
oh I still macam sedih seh you and simon tak pergi honeymoon
the thing yang I akan look forward to right
thai pancake sedap dok thai pancake
ya but krabi punya water activities mm lame juga ah
I nak ikut I nak ikut mak dan ayah
tak boleh itu honeymoon
okay abeh atas I tell my parents I go with you then over there we separate
then kat sana kita separate
kalau pergi krabi
ah ah kita I tell
I tell my parents that I go dengan you then kat kat sana then I separate lah dengan aqil lah
no tapi nak buat like you can do your own things boleh buat benda sendiri boleh
lepak jer water activities makan lepak
you don't like macam buat activity
tapi macam sightseeing pergi like hiking pergi like um visit temples and shit
I'm okay to like shop like maybe half a day or like two hours or three hours kalau the whole day nak pergi shopping I boring seh like bosan gila
macam restless as err especially if like I tak cause I don't really like shop much
if I don't have anything that I like then boring gila seh
I feel like kita should go
buat anak dekat bali
uh kalau kita empat pergi bali aqil dengan I kita pergi uh ee kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
orh yesterday um we saw aqil ah class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like he was with his girlfriend oh my god the girlfriend cantik gila sia I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like uh ya melayu but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like macam like I say hi ah but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then aqil was like are you like shy then I was like no I just I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
because right babe when we duduk in the car aqil need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
I am not complaining ah cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I tak complain lah pasal I pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so up to you lah you nak on aircon I okay jer you nak waste nak waste gas
but I think one thing that I need to like um get used to is dia punya cemburu
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila I cakap pasal like my guy friends or like shah shah sia shah is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam oh maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
like to me it's like uh old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that one I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything lah between you
I punya timer five three two eight
orh pasal aqil tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard ah to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like oof damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full lah
so macam
especially practising muslim so macam like ah but macam I have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian ah like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like I don't wanna ya so like macam oh okay like that's your view too
gasak kau lah nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so I tak kesah ah dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa I nak tegur you know
so I think part yang dia like in terms of I'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on aqil like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will I scared they feel like aqil is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair lah pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I yang nak kahwin pe
I think my my parents punya fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life lah like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
macam tak sincere jer
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning lah like properly macam
apply for house then like um because aqil just started working so his is tak banyak
I feel like I feel like aqil is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia tau dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe

then dia bawa like bakul of makanan
ya but aku rasa kau punya kereta boleh ah sebab besar seh
kan habis kau just bawa kau punya
kau punya laptop then kita tengok netflix
wah shiok sia habis kau bawa cushion
ah someone actually ajak me to watch train to busan but then out of nowhere tak update
um tak ada slot then after aku macam okay lah sedih
then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay I was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap mm
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku sia
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati kan dengan heat dia
eh kau tahu aku tak dapat seh yang that kids club punya
merepek seh
what if what if all of aku punya
month is aku tak hardworking it's just macam nak tak nak
teman you
so kalau
kalau haikal dia masuk kau okay
kau excited sebab kau tak payah layan dia
I mean it depends sebab kan
um most of the time is quite lepak
like tengok section kau ah like macam
most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict
then kalau after dia book out dia nak jumpa kau macam mana eh
mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik
before one habis aisha like my mum called me a lot of times ah oh yang kau tahu yang
yang aku aku ambil gambar dengan zeko yang kita side by side
ya so that day right my mum dapat tahu my mum called me like around ten
she said err where are you so I said lah like I'm at newton then she said err awak keluar dengan lelaki kan then I was like

so cakap okay lah then aku text sarah aku cakap
how mama know I went out with zeko then she said
sometimes aku tak bilang apa like aku aku tak bagi nama
so aku macam okay whatever lah aku malas nak fikir
so aku sudah mak aku asyik call like around twelve like macam pukul berapa nak balik pukul berapa nak balik
so after that aku sudah sampai rumah like around twelve fifteen then mak aku asyik call then aku bingit
then aku saat masuk rumah aku cakap ah relax lah like it's only
eh like you said our curfew is one but then kau call aku
pukul dua belas semua like pukul berapa nak balik like it's so annoying then aku balik aku cakap
um yang si aisha mana like dia sudah balik ke belum pergi ah call dia
then after that mak aku macam ya lah nak call dia sekarang
then ah then aku macam okay ah whatever then aku bilang sarah like
ya aku sot but then I think it was like my tone
bila aku balik rumah then because it was so annoying so after that saat um
after like five minutes or ten minutes later aisha balik
then aisha pergi masuk bilik dulu ah so aku kat luar so obviously aisha macam nak gossip gossip
um dia pergi bilang sarah
cakap um pasal mariam ah um mama cakap mariam biadap
itu pasal aku kena balik siang then sarah cakap
err apa yang kau merepek eh like curfew memang pukul satu apa yang kau nak salahkan mariam
which is true ah like apasal kau macam
cakap oh it's mariam fault now I have to go home
padahal just because I was rude like macam kau tahu curfew pukul satu like
kau fikir kau special sangat like you know macam boleh balik like any time
like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap err adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau
err sudah biadap balik lambat semua then itu pasal aisha nak kena balik
so but then aisha was like blaming me then aku macam like
oh ya then mak aku cakap tak lah like err aisha kan
macam okay so aisha's friend right is like macam
so aisha cakap like um eh mak aku cakap aisha punya kawan
um macam family tak ada family support that kind
so kita macam oh okay lah then mak aku cakap dengan aku err so yam kalau awak nak cari
kawan make sure yang baik-baik semua then after that mak aku cakap
so awak err zeko dia sudah bayar yang duit government
so aku dengan sarah macam tengok each other kita macam
like how you know then kita tanya mak aku ah how mama know
then she said ada lah mama ada spy
so aku sudah sot like I was damn pissed off lah I was like
ya then after that at first aku sudah bilang sarah aku cakap oh zeko kena bayar balik that five hundred
then after that sarah macam oh okay then after that out of nowhere mak aku tahu
then um dia cakap ah confirm aisha bilang
then mak aku cakap tak lah um mama tahu jer gitu like mama dengar so aku macam
uh huh padan muka dia like kan mama punya mulut sudah err masam eh masin
mm ah kan mama punya mulut masin like I already told her to not balik lambat or like
then bila aku sudah keluar semua err aisha texted me she said
err I kena fined blah blah blah then I was like
um huh no lah mama kan ada spy you ask her lah
that you told mama about it then aku cakap um
tak then aku macam aku cakap tak bagus fitnah like anyhow only aku cakap gitu then dia cakap whatever lah
um apasal like mariam nak kena expose aku like
habis sarah pergi reply dia cakap
then after that aisha cakap ah like um like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that betul pe like story itu is zeko's story tapi apasal kau pergi bilang mama
habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
err habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then aisha say oh gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
and and one thing I don't like about aisha kan dia macam
like one time she macam she balik the she said um
apa tu oh she went out to eat with haziq like one of her friends ah yang pernah suka dia
then after dia cakap oh haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai err what ah what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time kan aku punya button kan dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak sia kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
tapi itu nasib tak ada zeko sia kalau tak dia sudah macam cakap ah siapa suruh pakai baju ni
it's true because if you don't have strict parents right like your parents don't care like if you've matair
ya but then kau
the problem is about kau orang kau orang punya time and like macam parents dia pun quite strict
about matair
if tak strict aku rasa most of the time dia sudah ajak kau sudah datang like
relax kau tahu lagi semalam aku pergi rumah zeko aku masakkan dia
tak cause aku aku sudah masak kat rumah aku
so for yesterday so aku macam okay ah like nevermind aku datang rumah kau
so aku supposed to bawa the food like we can eat together like kat rumah dia
then end up mizi pergi habiskan the rice that aku masak
then aku macam ah shit it's okay then sudah sampai rumah dia
aku tanya dia sudah makan dia cakap belum dia makan cheese cake
then aku tanya ah like err do you have all those ingredients that I can
so mak dia tak ada kat rumah so aku call mak dia aku suka like where do you keep all those like
stuff lah the sayur-sayur all that shit
then mak dia cakap kan okay kat fridge blah blah blah then okay sudah cari semua then aku masakkan dia
different sebab aku pakai for my house right I use cube
a'ah kau tahu macam the tom yum cube all those shit
but then zeko punya kan kita tak ada cube dekat U star
so kita pakai serbuk yang powder
so aku macam okay ah hopefully it's nice ah then
end up okay lah quite nice it's quite pedas
but okay then aku bilang sarah err kalau aku pakai serbuk
tapi aku tak pakai cube okay tak then dia cakap
kau nak masak kat mana then dia cakap are you cooking at zeko's house then aku macam ya
habis dia ketawa dia cakap kau tak tahu malu seh then aku cakap ah like
then sarah say tak tahu malu then aku cakap like is it wrong
ya but then macam pada sarah macam why like why are you doing this then aku macam what like
okay nanti aku akan masak lah
it's so senang kau nak aku masak kat rumah aku ke aku masak kat rumah engkau
eh actually rumah aku lah it's so senang
ya aku aku sudah split duit dengan kakak aku then aku macam how much should I bring then aku cakap okay ah about ten jer
okay tak apa nanti kita tengok ada apa

my best friend yang I feel that it's more suitable lah cause I busy lah with work
kerja then I need to jaga my nenek and atuk
ah speaking of that err about family kan how how are you err ayah and mama
dia orang okay lah
aiyo dia masih belajar situ lah alamak
so macam like err kirakan dia punya pelajaran is a bit uh staggered behind lah is it
but but the your your brother is a genius lah budak pandai kan so shouldn't be an issue lah for him
ya ya my err yang paling kecil lah she taking O level this year
she seems pretty ready I guess sebab dia macam revise lah at home
she err staying up like lewat malam just to macam she catch up on her revision
err nasihat nasihat yang baik lah orang katakan lah ya
ya as suri teladan lah to her
ya her birthday is coming though so I'm pretty excited to celebrate dia punya hari jadi ya
err bulan depan I think early early early august ya
your dad's birthday is coming also right in two months dua bulan from now
ah boleh celebrate sama sama ah macam gitu ah
cause she's been applying for kerja kerja yang macam full time dekat ah those art companies lah last I heard is the teaching lah
she might err ajar budak secondary school so she went
ya ya she's up sebagai our best lah ya the prestige programme lah in our school you know junior college ya
ya she tried lah so now tunggu result jer lah see what the says if if approve then she gets into lah if not
you need two to three minggu from now
ya I feel super disappointed ah I mean kalau tak I already had plans or to travel around europe lah
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa lah people wouldn't think lor
and ya and err on the bright side also nasib baik lah cause I save a lot of money I mean the money I can use it to beli rumah ke
ya oh ya then ah how's your your dad's ah youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya betul
so you expect the baby to appear at eh appear eh they expect for the baby to be born lah in err dalam late november begitu
ya all of us are pretty excited lah kita even macam dah buat a baby shower um eh not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits lah given ya this macam hard
ya and I and my kakak wen is the
anak pertama lah to carry a child for the family
so ya my my mother and my uh brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out lah the this party for us
so harap harap err it's going to be fun err it's gonna happen I think ah early next month also
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
err aktiviti-aktiviti lah yang kita akan buat on that day itself
the government punya pantang larang kan mesti ikut
kita respect respectable lah
eh jangan lah
malu lah
because she can still err go to work lah but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
because he works at the port right so he helps err he is a I think I think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang lah kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he macam gembira ah like wow finally he get a job ah
err ah school err apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us lah for for
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on err facebook live
so they will be like oh ah school of engineering dekat bawah jer nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw lah so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods err jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets lah
ya dia lagi sikit menang seh she said err she said err the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
I actually ordered err ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah I think got no one so uh ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure lah cause the number is
ah the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her lah but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
so mana tahu ah got nasib ah time tujuh then baru hantar
sudah macam one package already
to macam give her I I heard they give her like cremeway alright for her to munch cause of her support for you
aku tahu semua ni ya
that's very nice okay oh it's a chinese girl I I I I forgot I thought it was a I've I've always thought that it will be macam err mixed girl lah
oh really I tak perasan
oh so she's also in our university juga lah
oh she any idea which err kursus she admit in our school
oh wee kim wee is a oh jangan bilang you take double major because of her go wee kim wee
you jangan main-main ni ah
ya pretty surprising eh terkejut I you know
faham lah faham lah
so that macam so far takde macam concrete plans lah with a it's just like you guys
ya lah nanti orang cakap apa kan kalau kita iya lah terlalu excited all then
dude I really want to I really want to but susah lah ni
probably satu dua jam then after that you have to sleep because your work in the next day and
paiseh sangat
jadi kalau awak macam interested kan you can actually join us lah because we just need one more one more person to play the lead guitar we have nadia on the
and then we have err loofy on the keyboard and I'll be paying the drums so we just need someone to fit in the role as pemain guitar lah for us so do you uh interested
uh this is sometime next week dalam hari either jumaat atau sabtu
tengok ah loofy macam mana ah loofy dia memang kadang-kadang suka main-main ah dia macam tak tak serious ya
ya that time dia ni dia dia kerja dekat challenger juga for one day
then after that he I think he fought with his manager that's why he had it lah cause I think the manager kind of bully him also but given he's aggressive nature kan so he macam he quit on the very day also lah
he quit lah I mean ya it they kind of buang him lah he even though he is as as as aggressive as he gets dia punya orang baik sebenarnya
he was the top scorer lah for our class though I don't know ah for A level surprisingly dia punya result didn't reflect
so macam a bit hampa and disappointment
err ya we doing before solat
then after that we pergi solat sama-sama
oh ya ya ya me and loofy kita orang dah apply dah earlier earlier beforehand we apply already
but usually dia punya slot usually cepat ambil lah pasal dia pakcik-pakcik semua dia orang always wants slots right
ah usually the tingkat satu ah closer to the imam
oh no no no no no err now now the wuduk you take from home ah then
ya they they close off the matikan all the air lah
ya tu lah kita orang tak nak banyak interaction lah with other so we keep it at the minimal lah
but who knows you might fist bump juga in the masjid also lah maybe I mean
mm but this is all purely just speculation lah ya bukan betul kan
mm so makan biasa-biasa jer lah like mee rebus dengan mee soto
wow nasi sambal goreng bang dia punya rendang apa
kau kena try bro
tak tak tak sempat because I bangun like just nice at the ninety four minutes mah
then just nice lah so like I terbangun then like oh my god dah pukul lima eh so the next thing I do was I ambil wuduk then I prepare for subuh lah
so ya cik jamal
ya he was lah but he he don't want to macam made me conform to any err beliefs lah
ya it's like he wants me to have the freedom to choose apa team yang I nak support
understandable lah dia orang dekat kan
boleh masuk champions league ya
oh jauh sangat lah
sean jadi millionaire
so any message you want me to hantarkan sampaikan kepada mister havi
I think tiga puluh tahun kan and I think
he's been waiting for this lah dah lama seh he tunggu go their win right
so he really it really bucks him lah when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak uh perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform lah
my as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy ah kat yishun situ
the daerah canberra
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
oh oh so so you so you were like macam patrolman lah gitu ronda-ronda around the area
wah they are not worrying ah like you I mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
oh err I mean like since you are posted in a the area macam tak ramai orang kan so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
macam tak pressure lah orang tak I don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ah dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan lah so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
oh lari-lari anak around area
but but usually berapa jauh you run
macam the only only time I ran jauh gitu is back when I was in serving my lah they make us run around ubin
and I think that's the way lah macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit jer kalau boleh jangan minum at all
uh habis
thirty minutes baru jer minum that that's the ideology that
ah macam
ya it's about biology larh and then oh ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni lah um ah wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much lah nanti orang cakap kan
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
okay true lah because like for me macam I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks kan macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so uh at home pun I only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only ah the best alternative would definitely be juices ah
oh no I don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause I feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
apa tu benefit lah so I selalu beli pergi pasar then I beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
ah biji biji buah-buahan then I balik I potong I blend
then I letak air then I minum ah
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend lah when you blend kan you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
ah dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay lah the kulit err
oh ya ya ya apa dia apa I heard some fruits eh if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good lah jadi kena macam pandai-pandai lah
ya oh eh grapefruit dengan grape is lain eh tak sama eh
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama kan dia orang two different fruits ah lain kan
siapa ah yang come out eh nama-nama ni
tu lah
lain eh aiyo
