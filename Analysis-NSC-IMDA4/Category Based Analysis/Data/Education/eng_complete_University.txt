the boogeyman is out to get you
the the bugis man uh
that your ancestors were pirates ah
I don't know sia
uh huh
eh so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
orh but like of all the things a pirate ship ah that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something uh
ya
sure sure
the spur of the moment that kind of thing eh
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through lah huh
but you would think
huh
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of angmohs
but the angmohs were like you're you're so cool
ya lah he working at some burger
on the arm
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
uh huh
orh I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people ah
brand tattoos for her friends that kind ah
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first lah
ha
actually
ah like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part lah
I think like this is what tattooing feels like ah
you see how it feels ah
like getting injections over and over again
okay lah I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast ah
like really rapid
uh huh
uh huh
was that on impulse also or what
uh huh
uh huh
that your sisters what
oh ya ya
uh huh
uh huh
oh
okay lah so anyway it's kind of like fated ah that you
weren't supposed to get that tattoo ah
or do you like keep it all from her
then her friend is like the party kind ah
oh
orh so they know what you are up to lah
are you gonna go mexico do you have any plans to go mexico soon

ah
uh huh
but you don't remember ah
ah
not like the hit up other girls kind of satan ah
mm
uh huh
dude you remember or you don't remember
okay lah I guess it turn out for the better lah huh
well I just I just finished my reservist today also ah
never sia
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes ah more like it
ah
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half lah the other half was
but ya other than that
err what time ah
like
uh ya
ya
orh
ah
sia
oh then my medical call
not bad ah
quite interesting ah
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill lah yes ah okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
err are you the one who called just now then the guy was like ah ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he oh his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is uh pretty rare ah to to to see like shocks getting given by the ah
ya but the guy
uh huh
oh
orh but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping ah
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
oh
compulsory to what
oh serious ah
ah
uh huh
okay lah I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay lah that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home ah he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
uh huh
ah
ah
so from from no breathing no pulse ah
oh ya that guy
uh huh
uh huh
confirm gone ah is it
uh huh
got the what again
ah the the one and two and three and four and that kind ah
ah
wait that was a doctor ah
it isn't you know
sian sia
who gets to do as in nobody want to do oh nobody wanna do
why sia
uh
huh
but uh
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also lah so he was saying that
cause
orh
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is lah but like
no point
oh
so can what
huh
ah ya ya the ugly one lah
oh
ya ya
oh ya I ding was telling us lah
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the lah recall
ah
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
oh
mm mm
okay ah
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay lah fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress lah cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no lah but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya lah definitely sia
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge lah but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the ah take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense ah
ya
and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
oh
uh huh
eight people
wah
oh
but wonder how often it's actually being used lah in
ah
ah
eh my friend from paya lebar also the madam told them don't turn out sia
they said they want to minimise
ah they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
ah fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I suay ah my
ya sia
don't know ah apparently it's the first time ah that
only the
they said because of the or something ah
but I don't know ah not really buying it
okay ah bo pian ah just go ah
then they also all the all the people were like
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called double meaning ah
so like
ya lah so must just be extra alert
okay lah but as in bishan usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad lah at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay lah interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different sia
what didn't you download the app
ah
uh huh
I think for you all different lah cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay ah
download what
oh no lah I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
oh the card ah
oh for a as a reservist ah
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
uh huh
uh huh
what did I what did I teach you
oh
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
uh huh
oh I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected ah
oh ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know ah
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
uh huh
uh huh
that one they are not choking already ah
huh
ha
in case anything happen like just cover your back ah is it
orh
oh so she wanted to go to the hospital ah
huh
something lah you feel like you are contributing it ya
oh
ha
huh
so you were already were were you there on the scene already ah for this
that was that was was that you
orh wasn't you ah ah
wah yesterday they were telling me like
err ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
ya ya that one that one
then
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
that you can close
ah so like
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
then he like
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
then which doesn't make sense because
but he climbed downstairs
then door open then he like he told them ah what he saw
then the two people outside like eh
but we didn't even close the door sia we just like we just held it ajar
ya that's the
as my my my call
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
ya
then what you doing tomorrow
ah
uh huh
oh so you buying for yourself lah
orh
ah
oh
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen kan
then I I was having headaches like every week
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
oh shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
err
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo

okay how was your day
you have to go to work tomorrow right
in the morning kan
ya
in the afternoon not in the morning lah
mm
production meeting eh
prepare for the production meeting at the the details eh
ya
ya bit busy month
but traditionally it's the busiest month for you right
traditionally for the past
twelve thirteen years right the demand december november december but not this year right because of COVID right ah
I see
what time will you be back do you think
okay cause I need to prepare lunch
and I want to I think the kids will definitely want
to eat the fish with you lah the
I don't I think for you is best to eat
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
why
ya
stretch the food even further the food we have lah
so I also don't want to waste food ah okay so tomorrow then you have to continue your work but you be working from home right you'll be studying from home right
the details ah
why take so long you still have to do research is it for each slide
that sounded like writing right it's almost like writing what
but you didn't put that much effort when you were write
I have to edit the what your write your your your what your article is is it your your assignment
two three pages but you know it's like
not it's not so bad it's not so badly done I mean I'm not trying to say you did it quite badly but
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
err who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like eh that's not the famous song from tokyo square
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the tokyo square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it ah
so tokyo square actually that
it's not a a got a tokyo square concert but they perform a few songs ah
uh because there are many other things that err at that show so tokyo square was one of them so I I I remember tokyo square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word tokyo slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
to america right they don't have
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is sukiyaki ah from what I know
that's the that's the unique thing lah that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin I need you
put us somewhere then she brought me with her lah so I think one of that that's why she know tokyo square
uh
they had this show they had this
ah so you remember lah
mm
uh the open space then they put up err the stage right eh um but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like what
uh
sam willows
uh
is there a song baby jane eh
uh
four
ah
uh
uh
ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese err medium right like the malay medium
err have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
uh on the side line lah it's like the a full time job for them
uh
I mean actually added actually actually them the I'm actually say it's the
is the the talent right
he was able to
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous what
ya
ah ya the malay medium lah but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like kit chan
at that she because she performed for cats even cats ya
ya
ya
not really a band not ya like but there is a talent lah like like the singapore talent ah
nuradi nuradi nuradi is a ah ya singapore talent
ya ya ya
astro eh
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this err
not fantastic lah not like ah zizan razak though
no I think
it's only people like ah zizan zizan eh
they are more exposure ya
the theater lah that the malaysia that we went to to watch the nadrah right
I remember when M nasir was talking to a
err hady eh hady mirza
for the
err what's the talent show eh
err M nasir so err hady mirza because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube lah I I I I watched through
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose lah
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think err err M nasir asked him err hady where have you been
because he was err wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work err
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem eh
like zoe tay and that time zoe tay was the were the in she was really the talent like pan ling ling
oh
her association
no I said if you want to go you can go with
no at that time lah
ah
pass away already eh
pass away eh
retired lah
how does it look like
oh
pointed out ah
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
she's just tired you know
and um
I think that's the main reason why they retire
eh even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine oh for you you are millennial I'm not sia
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
uh I am a generation X leh
it's really the you lah but you are not the the the the people that seroja and borshak was saying lah
the they were saying that this millennials ah lazy you know lazy ah
ya
ah
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
no she said people the
so
I think ten years eh twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even err make any profit
err around the same price as seroja
uh uh
uh
slightly more lah or around the same price lah
because she already bought a she already got err her flat
err her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
she want to because she love err cycling
I think she wants to cycle near the beach lah she doesn't have to
uh
ya lah but she has wonderful legs ah
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around uh ten years or so ah
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road eh
the amber road I'm not sure maybe ah
I think I I don't think is a new condo ah
uh uh
uh it's new it's new
uh
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
and not having to borrow money from the bank
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
oh my god sex heaven
condo kan
it's very very nice
uh
because I thought I I thought she stayed at serangoon garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
uh uh
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
huh
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask lah
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
especially french so I think it's something that they
uh
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very err thrifty lah sia
rent eh
uh
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
mm
that's why she move uh
make sense right
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo lah
uh
uh
uh
so they are a bit different lah their their the way they
their upbringing is different right
uh distinction lah uh
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so lah
uh
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best lah the best usually not them lah
uh I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace eh
she he ya
ya
he went to eton know that was his socialization tau
oh I uh my father owns a travel agent company
uh
uh and then
uh
uh huh
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
uh
this is doing you know
ah
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I I found out that he was educated at eton so I was like eton then dasha was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to err the people in eton but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the eton boys err russian lah
eton is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
ah ya
uh
uh huh
by russia ah no uh but uh
ya and and and the thing is is not just uh it's not just vietnam but also uh indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
err study in russia because russia uh uh study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year ah to brush up on her russia before she
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america uh it's recognise lah
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when err kacha was telling me kacha the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to sarawak or sabah
uh
huh
money
ah
malaysia hospital recognize
uh
but she cannot come and work here
uh
uh rundy his sister she studied in ireland right
no ireland not scotland
ah
ah
ah ah
to send her daughter to australia
the pace of life is different lah
uh uh laid back
she told me that
aiyo kartini what you think is so serious and important here over there is like
so laid I mean this is sofiani who finish his
paper like one week or two weeks earlier before the deadline you know this guy and he said that we really went over to australia he just learn how to be so laid back that he doesn't really care but I know
sofiani will find it very difficult to not care lah you know
ya he will care a bit but maybe not as much as before
ya
ya
I know your auntie have to challenge with
challenges with the egypt and jordan right
right with the girls right but the guys are the ones studying local
you know ahmad ahmad stays here
ahmad was like when he switched to secular right
adi secular
ah same as ahmad right
oh
ya
strength
their strength is languages uh
ya
ya
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test leh
ya but we we found out from my
err university of
jordan and the university of
not cairo lah err al-azhar
al-azhar
al-azhar
uh it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
they don't consider a degree for al-azhar a degree
uh
don't know allahu aalam
uh
uh
ya
uh wani eh
unless they do online lah unless they do online lah but I don't know al-azhar now not that good lah
the system of learning ah
err I think ever since the the egyptian spring ah uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time lah we know that the story lah
oh now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
uh but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
err at the
uh
err visa at the jordianian embassy ah
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran lah you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the fusha
that's the that's the thing lah so they get whatever they can
uh they can throw that at your face
you know but that is the the the nature lah but then you want to get the sadat eh they call it sadat you you want to get sadat so you do that lah
let her just stay here lah let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
uh
language is a bit hard lah
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
uh
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength ah
uh I mean I have friends who who like for example murni and I have a mutual friend
err okay lah one of our girlfriends lah
so I'm not that close to her lah because
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
uh
err

how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside

this was like in like primary five I think ya
ya
ya okay anyway
anyway
and then he corrected me seh
ya he corrected me and then he's like oh your english sucks
ya ya and then I left the group
ya I left the group cause
because of him lah to be honest and that was like rude what like I know lah like my english sucks at that time of point but you don't say that to a person
I don't know I I don't care
I have no idea I literally have no idea
ugh that's not the point
ah just just so rude but anyway
that incident made me want
ya made me want to brush my english ya
look at me now
ya
ya just now
we just ordered food actually I wanted to go out cause I didn't wanna stay at her place
oh by the way karisma didn't pass her driving
so what happen

uh like she sounded confident lah ya right
eh
I think it's just the nerves ah
huh serious why
but she book already
then she should book
you already have motor just take the motor lah
okay lah actually no it's good
ya okay
auto
your head lah no need lah for what don't waste your money
you want you do ah your money right
ah then she's like she's sad she still talk about it
okay lah ya same I get the feeling
but it's okay I mean at least her instructor nice kan
her own instructor
ya
ah
ya
sort of but she but she applied for to teach
I don't know like after this english test then she will
teaching ah
this is diploma in teaching
ya diploma so she can only teach in primary school if I'm not wrong
obviously but speaking of that
ya I don't know how about you
industry
oh
oh so when what do you mean by food what manufacturing ah
like do you get
okay
food oh
oh
okay
chemistry
oh
I get it then so what could be your potential future careers with that degree
what would it be
mm mm mm
ya
mm mm mm mm
ya
I see but so interesting
ya
oh serious why
uh huh
oh
ya
uh huh
oh but why I thought she just got a full time job
I no no I don't understand I don't see the point
but it's just what she's suddenly passionate I mean like not passionate but interested or
exactly
options
okay that's true
ya ya
stick to one
okay lah hopefully
ya
but to be honest my degree also I'm also not so sure if I want ya
if I want to
ya stay or like continue finishing
huh
ya
why
alah this is why
ya honestly
but their I mean the teaching style is quite relaxed ya
ya
ya
then just try to help out each other in any way that we can

I don't know if I can adapt to be honest

is it the same assignment that I have oh
oh yes yes yes um ya me too me too I was supposed to wake up at nine err eight thirty
ya eight thirty cause I want leave house at nine thirty right and then I woke up at nine and then I was like hmm what time is it I was like oh my god it's nine and then I didn't want to get out of bed
like it was so hard and then I was like okay lah and then suddenly you see take your time lah it's okay lah then you say really take your time
I was like did she just leave the house
ah
ah
mm
uh oh
ya oh my god that's really really far why why why
pity you oh ya she study
oh for ad hoc eh nice cool cool cool cool cool
school oh okay
oh for different department ah
oh then they will just photoshop people in the same group lah
eh she was at her
oh wait she is the
eh she is head ah
oh who is the vice head
oh yes yes yes yes oh my god
I like I was like trying to think who is the oh K K K yes yes yes
ya
ha ha does you feel like not being in ad hoc this year that's great
I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
oh because they're not gonna do any physical okay
ah I see err no eh they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no lah I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
mm ya ya ya
oh
oh okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
mm do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
um like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like oh like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester lah
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I feel she was like ya
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys tau so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like oh my god there was a okay lah
you can just
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
come here looking for like eh it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of um Muzmatch and also like like half our deen right the app this dating apps but the half of our deen is
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our deen
I think half of my deen or half of our deen I can't remember and then um
she met this guy so like err he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
the I think because
half of our deen need you can have like yearly subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister um by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
mm
is it
I didn't know
oh okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was oh like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
um not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
um this interface to tell me okay ya
mm
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that oh my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say lah like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
eh do it leh let me be the why
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that uh
um quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
eh
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
I guess um
when you this is very superficial lah but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join um ad hoc and stuff like people already
say lah you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
what's like your ideal date
ya lah
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
mmhmm
mm
oh
mm mm
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
ah because
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
oh
I mean it opens up doors to topics of conversation afterwards like
ya
ha your date how long
um okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya oh let's go trekking then we see how lah
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
ya so sweet
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
oh no oh my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
they just went toilet and then they never come back
mm
ah
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is lah
ah I see
ghost
ya so that was this um they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
um on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so lah ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like um he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
mmhmm
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
ah I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing um that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
show uh that day I just find it
ya and then err so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I I really forgot what's the show ah cry
maybe just finding
kan
just you know
I mean at this oh love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
err ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
um they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality lah
mmhmm mmhmm
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
mm
mmhmm
mm mm
match making ah
um yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that one is it's kind of sad lah cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like ah you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
my batch mates tau I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya kan is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
err ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes hazimah
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
oh my
actually ya that's a good thing ah and I I've thought about this my answer is no lah I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on story
um to my sec four students uh here like um no actually is like oh uh
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
oh I'm proud to live in singapore err to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like oh K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
oh god
I saw I saw yes
about like oh like why did you not care about politics oh because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
um have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
uh like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me lah because then do I even matter to you
because I feel like if you want to be
um you uh
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
ya
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
uh huge like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
um
and then like talking about Mendaki system uh subsidies and stuff and like
prove that no chinese privilege ya
ya it's just um
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that oh you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
oh because oh like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like hijabi don't get to wear a hijab all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya
ya
ya like
ya it's like oh we should be grateful that we are giving you some rights oh oh okay
ya like
ya like okay can then like
coming from a I feel like a
I would say privilege background
like I was very um
blind sided to all these issues that was prevalent to this society
like I was
I feel like I was like always trying to be accepted in
ya ya
ya
ya
took a lot of unlearning to finally accept that you know what
it's okay like
ya like I'm proud of being who I am and I shouldn't care about what others
like
I mean that's how conversation works
oh my god like ya
ya I feel like recess week is ending kind of fast

that is nonsense
you can't say it
oh what what which do you like best

I already know mine but it doesn't live in the zoo

I love cheetahs I love cheetahs for my entire life
yes
and I get by basing their cause there's like cheetah leopard yes
leopard yes yes yes
do you know that cheetahs don't roar do you know what sound cheetahs make
oh my god I would love to show you no they do not
they do they do make noises but
they do not call for kor kor
hold on ah
my favourite word sleep
I don't know eh dude there's one
no this is a full grown cheetah
the purr but it meow
and then they also make some okay you listen to the beginning right they actually make some other sound
ya them they make this sound
don't know
kan
like I
I love them so much I love cats any any kind of cats
ha ya they are all cats
they are so cute
like I want to meet a cheetah one day
oh
ya like why should they be in the cage
aduh
ya additional five dollars for the boat rides then I was like pe and then
not actually a lot of things is not on the river a lot of things is
no idea maybe there's a river there that's all
right and then I feels like ha maybe cause like can go first
a bit like a roller coaster kind of
really inside the lock right it's like a lock right there's a mechanic you know so you just go through it's like a ten minutes ride
no I thought it was going to be real but it's not
but but uh kai kai or jia jia whichever is the female one she's pregnant yes cute
then like they like she had to she couldn't come out lah she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think kai kai is the guy one kai kai was um
ah menopause ya
the jia jia was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
I love pandas they are so clumsy just
yes
yes
does it include animals
babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
mm that is interesting I think mine is also on
shows that
ya
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying um
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
they are like
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like oh
my heart you just called me your husband
oh so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try lah like oh like do a live oh my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother oh okay lah then your friends then
I've never thought of it that way
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
kan and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling lah that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya so
inshallah
putting it out there yes I think my my family won't be nice too
okay lah good luck to my sister then

hi
okay ya
what do you mean what happen today
oh okay so basically
huh
yes I did oh my god I'm exhausted but like did I not like I had don't think I got tell you but like a girl got her new MacBook today and then you are the first one I'm calling on my MacBook she's beautiful she's gorgeous
oh my god ya okay so I ended up buying the gold one apparently on Apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so I don't know whether people are blind or something
I like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby
orh
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
err
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like um
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
um
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so um
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story ah like since
um primary six
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that ah give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
hais neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name ah
so his name is #Adi#</P2
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is #Adi#</P2 something
ya I think
like it's a long name ah but let's just use a generic one ah then after that
so
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur sotong and all that all lah I don't know what I will do lah I cannot really remember
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk lah
then I will just never talk to the aunt even eh the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
then I was just like
huh
err I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
number one
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
how I cut my hair
ah the last time I went to an actual barber
ya so after I told huh
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
um
I don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed
like I don't know it seems like
yeah I even
ya lah it's not considered harassed lah that's true
but like
like how do they actually
judge you
per say you know
like
for my
my situation like I actually
they don't even know anything about me other than which school I go to I don't think she even knows what's my favourite colour
and what is she judging me as like on judging me on
when she wants me to be her
you know it's just weird that's just what I was thinking about lah
that's all there's that
like you know older than you or the same age or older gone girl girl bolt outta there and run

yeah
yeah
chillax back again
yeah
when
twenty
twenty seventeen ah
oh no

no wonder okay
oh
gap year
huh
chasing her
so she's still fickle-minded and then it's been two years and then she still doesn't know
maybe she still likes him but then why is she not getting together with him if she still likes him
ya but the funny thing is that I don't know kay I kind of get it if she like
still wants him back ah cause like it's her first what then like
I don't know lah okay like I've never been cheated on so I don't really know like now I can tell you like straight up like oh if he cheats on me I'm leaving his stupid ass but like
in that situation you never know what like
if you really love someone then
I don't know
huh
what
ah
mm
mm
Serangoon a'ah
okay
you're already late
confused
ee oh my god dude
oh my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
err one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really um I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
huh
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
like just touch wood lah imagine if you don't
have gotten together in the first place ah of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also #Saif#</P2 so
Rudy Aip what's up
okay cool
huh
what
what
huh
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
are they still together
to get out of jail
ah
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
oh ya sia like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
in but I would like
want him to tell me like hey we're gonna be in this for the long run lah
so okay so
um
there's this one friend of mine
like
um her name is Amy</P2
then like
ah
ah yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day eh this year and like we are gonna plan for it lah like they actually have a plan like a future Amy</P2 has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like Amy</P2 and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
um she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
oh I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things ah
no I just got blocked nose
I don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose I don't even know why
but yeah there's that
I just like
ah
ya so the next time Russell</P2 asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if #Saif#</P2 texts me I'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
huh
ah ya that's why how to go drinking I ask #Russell#</P2 pay ah #Russell</P2 my daddy

mm
I don't know man I got no nothing against you but I just don't like making smoothies
at Ice Talk cause they only have two blenders and they're so loud
but like there's that this is the reason why but like everytime it's either blue coral
yeah
I never
I never actually tried oreo blended
before
like you know the typical like macam Boost or like some shit like that lah but like the actual like just oreo and milk
and blend
never
like throughout my childhood I never
yeah I did also
mm
Ice Talk they put creamer
creamer and sugar cause they ask you what sugar you want
how much sugar you want
but like shout out to Ice Talk
your freaking hazelnut milk tea is a solid that's that shit is a solid milk tea
other than that nah

KOI
KOI I never tried hazelnut milk tea from anywhere
so anything you put on top of that is nice

yeah
ya cause any of the jelly comes with sugar what
why though
will you eat oh yeah you would I was going to ask you would you eat like the Cold Storage
I want to really badly
you wait until like seven o'clock eight o'clock when they cut
but like Sushi Deli isn't any cheaper though
when I went there like seriously
what is it and it's actually halal but it closed down but ya that one
ya fifty cents
ah
I should have taken everything
finish ah
I never
before Andalus I started in primary one so I think when I was like in kindergarten like for two years I was at
have you heard I think you've heard about it before no
yeah
so
um
but okay so the only thing I don't even remember going there you know but the only thing that I remember oh my god I love my whole story is that right
I came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
um
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
but like they went right
was like a family friend
then like
I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
ah then I was just like
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
I cannot remember but the only thing I can remember is what my mum is telling me which I did
and then I was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so I don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
I hate myself so much I was such a hoe
at such a young age
you know
okay we cool after so much shit and then #Aisyah#</P2 story's is just not done okay then
my mum I guess

but selected people or what
oh
that is not a reunion but okay kinda like okay
um
mm
some fucking vicious cycle right there
mm
mm
what
ya like why are you putting words into my mouth like what do you know
whether
or like what
so like ya in conclusion you really attract toxic girls
or friends I guess
okay that's a bad thing to say lah how are you supposed to make friends if you don't want to tell people
about
the things that bother you
but then really though like genuinely you really attract
really bad people but then we are friends so I don't know what am I saying about myself
I like
yeah

and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way lah you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van wah that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places lah
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya eh you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
eh but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience eh
oh my god
serious eh
okay okay okay
eh but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
mm
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match ah so my cousin and I didn't keep up
ah K
oh okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K lah at least you were sort of prepared for it lah to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
err melbourne was quite nice right eh or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it ah
like it was like an um
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
ah my god super super shiok
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
wow like that's an experience you won't get here seh
ya lah ya lah that's true lah
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also lah
ya more more expensive places err like
those I don't lame places lah like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
eh but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless what
that's true
eh but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know selangor pass selangor
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun eh but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that ah to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in lah like I need my dose of man
ah
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
oh ya never thought of that ah
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling lah
we drove that camper van right and then we got through err got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice what
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck ah to explore the ferry kan
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it lah
ya correct
ya correct
ya eh you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do lah but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh wow I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know ah oh it's just damn different ah or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had err more like
ya but if I had to pick
amorino K amorino is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and messina for the range
ya I think
ya because but wow messina has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything ah
gelato messina ah hands down ya
ah what what do you call it mm what was it like yuzu and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya mm
eh and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce wah best seh
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts seh
ya
mm
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
oh ya that's eh so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
uh I think it's the donut itself ah
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like wow oozing out ah
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something wow
wow like mind blowing seh
ya that was interesting ah ya
eh what what was that like curry curry eh
ah thai green curry eh
I I remember I remember there was something like um
ah plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice lah
oh to like caramelized the whole thing ah is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
oh K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually um in dragon's den as in
ah okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant prata over there lah
ya but ya lah I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there lah
mm
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like um things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember ah
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess ah I guess
ya
of course lah we had to what
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there ah even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot ah
and because those factory outlets kan have everything under one roof tau
bicester kan bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
oh and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain kan yes yes yes
eh it's a once in a lifetime chance seh we never know if we are going to pass by that place again lor
trying to recall lah
err
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty eh
fifty sing ah
ah okay eh what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then um
ya I just remember that that thingy ah what is it called ah
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to lah eh but the beaches there were nice eh
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
mm we really miss the nature ah
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya eh but malaysia nature not bad leh actually
ya
mm
no lah you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay lah I mean like okay langkawi has nice beaches
okay lah it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can ah while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have uh know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
oh
eh but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare ah
huh
so basically you were trying to catch your train err trying to catch your flight you mean
serious
oh my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
mm
okay okay and like the timing wise
okay no cash on hand lah you mean
okay
mm mm
uh huh
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
oh I see like how much it's supposed to cost ah
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
oh wah were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him lah
mm
start of an adventure eh
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
eh wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
ya ya like uh
mm mm
mm
oh I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
mm
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
mm
okay
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the prata was huge
then
oh
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
ah okay okay okay
I see I see
yup
oh
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me lah I've never I've never encountered this before so
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees ah it's just the shoppers will probably be like ah what are we going to do now at such an early time like uh we still want to shop
oh K K eh what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
mm
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay lah not a lifelong dream but
ya lah ya lah that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy kan
ya ya that's why lah
mm
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
wow okay
mm
mm
um circles and stuff
active eh ah okay
oh right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas ah

okay
you may start
no actually like I fetch her at um
like eleven plus
then I fetch her
she said she just want to like drink like macam relax ah relax and drink
drink drink something like teh not drink drink
then
then I say like I've I'm feeling like Coffee Bean
it was like macam difficult to find lah areas
and then like can just lepak at the
like by the beach ah
then end up end up like she we then then like after coffee okay did you know that Coffee Bean
the on Google it says that it's open twenty four hours
then we sat down at the playground
ya
so
I say eh you like prac six already right so can
macam
she shaky ah so it was quite stable and I was surprised
okay ah sorry ah
swerve
easily like not not necessarily better but macam
best friend okay lah can consider ah
okay
okay cause cause like um actually it was impromptu pe
then but then like I don't have any ah like extra helmet pe
ah then I ask her to go my house cause
so I say I tell her lah like come my house and take a helmet
then she come my house I wasn't at home pe she come my house
then she video message me she send she send me a video message of her eating at my house
no don't say that
sarah
pe sia
it's like some malaysian actor right
but
ya no ah by the time we reach there it was like twelve thirty
okay ah don't need to reveal my age
um
it could be
it could be cause like
comply to the
the timing
ya
okay ah
mm
it will be here
okay lah I mean if he's here
but it's just
oh
oh okay okay
okay ah
mufti monk kind of vibe
ya
okay ah
but
ah what do they study seh as in what do they study in school before they is it like they study islamic studies or what
like what
oh
oh
like more credible eh
ah
oh is it okay
cool
degree
okay
please
aww thank you
okay okay okay okay okay stop stop stop attacking me
seven thirty
okay um
okay
should I get later
hot ya hot devil
eh
but I think
it it's like a seasonal thing
crispy chicken okay
okay ah
okay
okay okay
um
ya
we can leave eleven
okay
for
orh
okay ah I mean
oh ya ya ya
um
wei then what what's your job as like advisor
ah
um
like the like exco member PERBAYU exco member need to have experience in like different ad hoc ya
so it's not not that bridging the gap kind of thing but more of like exposure for the exco member itself himself
ah
ya but
I don't know I mean you got say it's like a perks of
being exco member like
try
I mean I don't know
ya
oh
ah okay
but you sign up to be the
leader pe as in advisor leader pe
oh okay okay
ya but you have a choice to reject or accept pe
I mean
okay ah
um
oh I think it's clip though oh oh up up movie up
not really analyse lah but
um
ya I think okay macam like you need to incorporate your whatever theories that we learnt in class right just macam relate it to the movie
ya
is about err old people like elderly something like that ah
then
ya cause the the story is like
is is centered um centered on like this old guy pe ya so I guess that's how like my prof thinks that it is relevant
join ah
mm
oh ah ah ah
ah
so
so what's your what's your take on it
in the future but why is the future is now
mix
okay
okay
a lot of like
like on their especially in singapore like on their it will state
what race they are what
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
oh okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
err
like what's your point
uh huh
mm
like you say they shouldn't choose
oh
do you know that got some macam
ah
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
um probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
then they need indian pe and then that their open slot is only indian like macam that open open macam the empty house is only open to indians
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for ah indian
ya
ah
probably the same race
a'ah a'ah
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to macam some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying ah so it's like
um
uh
um
ya
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like um there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of ah like macam
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now ah
ah yes ah macam
ya so to a certain extent I guess like it's justified but did you know that macam this um
racial enclaves
ya
ya true lah true
ya and also macam there's a lot of like um
I mean this is what I learnt ah um
ah there's like two different kind of macam
considered private housing pe so they like they have um
actually not dorm more like rental rental places so like they can choose their roommates kind of thing then
like those big houses kan it's like that's the
yes
um
I think
condo
maybe condo okay I have a like macam a dream house that
is
but not but
eh
west okay
oh
okay
okay okay I think I
ah ah ah okay okay okay
ya
door

mm

ah it will be judge seh
they won't ask you ah but then like
if they don't understand then they will just judge you down pe ya
as in but at the same time
um is related
to
eh but you have to post on Instagram you know like as a post cause it's a it's a video it's a video

like not I mean I don't know ah it's like normal pe
ya eh did you have you seen the prize

ya so
honestly yes
if there is only three submissions you'll is like there's only three submissions you will get
something one like you get away like as in get
you will leave with something ah
ya
so
oi
mm
a'ah ah and
eh
okay okay okay
I think irfan ah
ya and also um the past ah it's very relatable
to I guess us
skim
ah
okay okay
ah okay ah that's all lah
dah okay bye

ya got it already
technically
I complete four hundred hours lah around wednesday but I stretch over
I took half day half day
ah
ya alamak
mm two and a half months around there
ya ya I just need to complete four hundred hours
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
kobe
I don't know
uh it's not project um it's just basically more case management
what I did lah for my previous job
we do lah same around the same lah it's more intense cause
err it's residential areas so it residential not institution lah
ah
I don't know if I want to say
okay lah
I don't know
the um from the office my my office there lah so
ah
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be lah
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay lah
but ya
finally somewhere I go is near my house
like at least at least ah fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
um not
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
ya
mm mm
ya ya no issues lah ya I think
I would say that she overrides him
ya ya I know
err oh last time
err the assistant director did this err blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask ah then
um ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in lah
ya
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
mm
I guess so good and bad lah
like what is it there's no bad impact lah on the client at the end of the day ah
like ya but
but at different locations ah under different program
mm mm
I think
in the social service ya
ah then it's also under so previously my previous job um they are the funders ya
so err
how to say
err fast and err presentable results
that's your
it's considered private affairs what uh
so in the end you have to get consent from them
they cannot
then
ya and then ya that's why
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
ya
ya correct correct
ya
supposed to
supposed to ya
uh no no
um you have to record down ah
and I was like
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for at all
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then ah
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference lah because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
uh people I think can't remember where
ah so I don't know lah what's going on
uh ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty lah
ya cause I just
uh like
I just like finished my practicum I just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time I have like exams which I like I haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay uh
my line is very small I don't know if it's clear or not but I'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes I move lah
so cute
so maybe when I take a break from studying lah I start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
um
like
I went to psychology then social work then after that like should I try something else
uh huh
mm uh huh
hmm
mm
mm I I
mmhmm
of course ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm ya
mm
true true uh
oh can ah you
can manage them you have to
be you have to
basically they can sense when the person can be taken advantage of
um you first of all kan on the get go right
you try not to be the
yes
ya
ah you stay true lah you stay true to what you say and then they will respect you
punishment promises
ah
ah
is it yesterday the
yesterday or
okay
uh huh
oh no
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
ya
ah
ah yes
mm mm
hmm
gambas

oh how much is it ah
mmhmm
mm okay
oh
oh okay okay I think I will
I
she

so I don't know lah I still haven't gone for it so
err
monday wednesday

I don't know

I I cancel
mmhmm
standardish I guess so
mm
uh huh
uh huh
mm
mm
ah
okay okay understand
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya mm
ah
okay
uh okay
okay maybe you should are you okay to like go for the hiking on tuesday
okay
huh
mm
okay can
oh I was like uh
I was like uh
I was like don't you think my voice sounds like a man when you play it over cause my voice is not
lower register lah basically
ya
ya unless I'm like super excited to talk then I can go quite high
I think one
then I was like err
ya
you sound like what my cousin inhan
but usually isn't it the the people with like deeper voice like you have a wider range
err I guess not like we're going to sing any time soon
oh no it stopped already at my side
ah okay lah good good good uh
listen to our
mm mm
ah
we're gonna die
what that's so funny
that's
ya but just ah yes
yes he wants to do like space right space travel or something like that right
is it him
you see
I don't know lah okay lah he got some admirable traits
I guess and then it's like he's from a I think
single I mean single mother household
I if I recall I think so lah
I don't know was it him or someone else ugh
cannot ask me who about celebrities background ah
huh
ya I did uh aiya
why
ya
um
that areas or like it's my area like which is far for you
um
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya good
like uh
uh
it's near to
ya it's near to tampines interchange actually
mm
I can send it to you but the the pictures are nice I think like I've
she goes to how's afiqah ah
ah
mm no
ah when was she married ah
ah eh
okay
ah okay okay
I
okay
you never met the guy is it
mm
mm mm okay ah nothing ah
eh is he our age
okay
okay now now where are they staying
ah
mm
mm mm
I think there might be some tension
ya
mm
ya ah ya
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
is uh
babysitters so
ya so
ya
ya
ya
I know
four months four months
mm
mm
you send the kid to play group lah then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure lah ya so do you want to work part time and then
I think ya

so basically um
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and err so err
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything lah about his life so
true enough lah he is a very uh forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an uh up point for him lah you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
changi airport
um
and that changi airport is what we thought it was lah to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it lah
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then um so now he is uh working at uh novena and he is there because uh he wants to do office work and rightfully so lah because he wants to uh spend more time lah with your family
uh and
since he has going to move towards
getting married uh he thought this the right step ah as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound lah in why he's doing it okay then he talk about um
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay ah this one ah oh every time I do as in ah like
was it so difficult to ah get this out
the mirror the mirror side
ah middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so ah what else um okay so I I
ah okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
ah that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
ah
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact uh do you have connect plan that's he look at me like uh what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years oh we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said lah ya ah six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and ah okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya lah but I don't know why they want that place lah anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
ah he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so um ya so that that part they understood lah you know what it's it's spilt milk ready lah kan like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why lah
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk zina whenever zina butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then err
ah revise plan ah ah correct
ah I also don't want to embarrass lah zina cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing zina session but no point lah the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for zina to actually ah secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows lah that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working lah and you zena needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience zena hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for zina to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children ah then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
ah that one okay lah they bring about the halal thing lah so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya zina needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
ashraf you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
ah come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
ah then they say
okay for me I uh I feel that
so it's like if he lah in the sense that ah so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told zina and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course lah
mmhmm
anyway I
so mm ya then I told him okay ashraf after all that's been said ah I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya lah I said you have
mm
then
um so basically that's it lah and then
at least it's it's clear lah that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
no he will just use
mm like
mm ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage lah
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at changi
ya so it's was very easy lah then after when he left also I was telling lah see how easy and simple ashraf
was
by just being upfront
no zina you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya lah so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my ah that's why it was very simple lah because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that lah kan
so and he also can recognize lah the value in it and can recognise why you know zina needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that zina needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time zina would be the one taking care of it
ashraf ah because uh
someone needs to be there at home lah he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or zina's parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working lah and then I then I ask him so uh are you exploring the possibility of zina working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
um
okay lor then after then the
in the dining
uh
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear lah clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
um
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
huh
zina is receiving dayah is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working ah ah
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
dayah at is at this stage of her life
mm
mm so we don't know that lah huh
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so oh anyway going back to zina I I told zina like
you need to sit down and you really need to uh
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough lah if he uh considered um
cause he then I say uh I
uh
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how ashraf is
I told her lah did you see or not what ashraf did
ya
that's why lah she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as oh
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
zina that is not easy-going
mm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going what
you are not um having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
mm
that's why during the
that's why ashraf
if
the way
ya lah of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent lah
I don't think he would lah if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
err
push zina right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
mm
so ya basically concludes the whole thing lah with
zina and ashraf then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya dayah and me then ya I understand that you and dayah are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what hidayah is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
ah
huh
you lah ah then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and izat I bet you ah you and dayah would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least ah you see ah it me and izat
I'm doubting you know whether you and dayah would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why lah that's why it seems it's
ya lah
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps lah
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay lah I think
I can tell that me and izat even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
uh huh
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya lah so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama wah at one okay at one point
mm
nevermind just mm
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like um there was one point where um
then I said zina since when you are that close to izat then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to izat then I say rubbish lah
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya zina you are close to izat because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to izat
izat is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct ah but I say you are close to the boys just because of uh
uh you are close to izat just because the boys uh with izat you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to izat
then I say since when you been talking to izat since when
all all the
you are that close to izat then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys kan
further studies
ah then I then I also
need this person the person ah to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what izat can do this job ah
ah then izat do you think then she's like smile ah aiya lah cannot lah
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
mm that's why
hmm
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward one really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course

alright
uh overstay my welcome is because I think it's too too long lah it should be
yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing lah you yes err so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back
earlier okay okay
uh huh okay
okay okay
uh huh
oo
oh I see I see I see
oh
ya yes yes right

ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct
yes correct exactly
yes yes

is it
uh huh
ah I I've heard of it before yes yes yes yes I've heard of it
ah
yes yes yes yes
correct correct correct
ah
right right right right

yes yes yes correct
yes yes yes
mm
yes
correct correct correct
yes
yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya
understand understand
ah
ya
yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective uh a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think uh it's quite it's it's something that uh there I I would I would um and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn lah
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
oh right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
oh definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
ah no no it was a academic uh more of a academic kind of uh mistake lah uh I mean it was a academic um how to say ah misstep which which I could have my my my um my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science ah which means then after that err the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was uh just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six ah I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit ah when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis ah so I had to remove my appendix because err it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had err not err what err gone to the hospital lah uh if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication uh in which this this uh operation actually made my stomach lining weak
uh because they have to cut they have to cut through mah so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my err my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another lah basically so it was first it was an appendix then uh it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical eh in a medical sector your intestines uh usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
uh apparently that can be fixed okay err and and basically what happens is uh if you fix it uh generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this uh this condition but um the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and uh hopefully hopefully lah ah cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again lah
huh this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was uh in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is err err specifically flying related
so uh they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day uh but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying lah
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that ah oh debt uh I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them uh ah no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate uh site I was actually doing uh business business aircraft when I was in the
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened err this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad err I mean it was just a very bad timing ah it was the worst hit industry ever uh unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and uh they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old lah so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again ah
to the parts ah they get uh they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
uh some of them they do but most of them for the most part err they don't need right they just they juts leave them there lah they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there ah nobody wants to uh you know ah then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this lah you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be lah
oh man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of uh of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot lah this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was uh it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay lah so I thought it was uh it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did lah and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
but but for now uh I got the next best thing which is uh flying drones lah
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers eh
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen ah but if that ever happens ah you will know why ah you know all about the history behind it lah you can tell people oh yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya lah yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know oh my goodness
yes
yes yes yes

ya ya
ya correct
oh man I can think of a thousand and one ways to keep myself occupied I can
ya
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya ya ya ya ya that's my plan
oo I understand what you mean
yes yes yes
yes correct
correct lah that's true lah that's true lah I mean of course there's there's there has to be a plan a plan and also a a strategy for you to like save up a bit of money you know and go there when you retire which is true lah which is true
ah
ya ya eh tell me about your some of your your ya ya ya what are you doing now and stuff
okay
okay
okay
okay okay
mm
okay
why I scared to be bankrupt because I don't want to owe people money
ah but then a lot of things are restricted like you cannot uh apply for your own home you cannot invest
ah but if you're somebody with a home and if you are declared bankrupt then they will take away their home what no meh not true eh is it oh I didn't know I thought they will take why all your your earthly belongings and your possessions
oo
oo okay okay explain to me
uh huh
ya
ya ya that's what I thought
ya
okay
is it
oo
uh huh
uh huh
oo
if I don't pay my utility bills will they take away my house
oh shit oh my I still have my house lah it's just that I have no electricity okay okay
okay
right okay okay
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
three hundred dollars a month okay
right right okay okay
ya
okay
ya lah ya lah you will be in more debt right ya
oo okay okay okay okay okay
okay
uh huh
okay
so you can still but how are you going to have the money to travel when you are bankrupt
but but like they will take away your assets kan don't they take away some of your assets how does it work
uh huh
right
ya I've always had that impression
uh huh
right
okay
okay
yes
yes
correct
correct
correct correct
okay
mmhmm
okay
I don't buy under my name
uh huh
uh huh okay
oo but wouldn't they be able to trace
because just because it's not under my name lah so if it's so so the thing is that if if let's say all these things are under my name then they can pull it away they can take it away
ah I see
mm
ya ya ya ya
ah
mm
ah I see
oo I see but then what happens to the amount that I mean cannot recover the the the amount eh
but for how long though
five you cooling period means you
uh huh
ah
uh huh
right
okay
oo
oo okay uh huh
okay
oh wow
ah ah ah ah ah
oo I see
I see okay
oo
oo
ya I was always under the impression that I thought
ah
okay
government jobs lah ya ya ya
okay
oo oo oo yes yes yes yes
okay
oo
oo
ah I see okay okay okay
so so it's not that you cannot get a job it's just that the jobs that you uh ah able to get are limited lah certain industries ah
mm
ah I see
ya ya ya I see I see okay okay
the system lah ya lah that's true
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
so technically
damn
damn
oh my gosh
ya
mm
mm
correct correct correct
oh shit man ya I get oh wah like that lah I tell you your finances are going to be
I see I see
okay
two more minutes
ah
ah

K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one lah
so I think you can start first ah
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
ah kinaesthetic
ah kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility ah
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective lah
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
oh so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
mm ah
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot lah what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing err port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish err irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
robert pattinson
ya that one
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers ah wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
ah if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
ah specifically to children ah because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard ah
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for ah
adults ah
um but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya lah but
teleportation ah
but it saves time it's very quick
mm
ya ah but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please lah don't cut me off lah the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this lah but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it lah ah
ya okay
so that's teleportation
err
um if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything ah
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
ah your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K ah teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son aydin
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
wah you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
mm
mm
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited ah okay
orh
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective eh
work hard themselves
okay
mm
okay
err but I okay lah maybe for you kan
K
but I oh something came across my mind lah
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
mm
showing
the other side of ya
mm
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
mm
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome lah
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
ah
ah the bull's eye of medicine ah ah
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for

the err primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also err too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't ah I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay lah actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays lah
no I want my holidays during off peak period
mm
kindergarten
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours one also
ya
yes last resort mm
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment kan so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing lah but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
mm
oh maybe I just don't handle stress well
ah like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second one so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that one I you know lah
they have been trained
ya amazing

clap ah
okay start
is our first time sia I quite nervous I'm so nervous
okay okay I think your phone needs to be nearer ya okay err just now we had our chinese lesson
so um like coffee bean was so packed ya so but no choice lah we really tried to find a place kan ya but I was also very sleepy ya so what do you do in the err sungei buloh
how many friends did you go with
is it the the malaysian guy that you told me about before
oh
then you all didn't decide to grab lunch or something
oh
oh what did you buy
he was he was singing then I was like wah in my heart eh is like like bursting tau ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time err he was a bit down and like err demotivated kan
so when I like I heard him singing then wah like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like oh my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week ah ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also
your face ya so ya lah so they were encouraging him to sing more lah cause they were happy that he's happy then err he even he was like err cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is rex he's a filipino guy
so he was like rex I'm going to dedicate this song to you and like all the nurses in this ward for taking care of me and then he was singing the all of me song ya ya john legend I cannot remember ah all these names ya so ya lah so they were they were like some of them were singing with him also like while they were doing um I think doing his blood test and all that
ya so like I think I think as a nurse also if I were if I were the nurse also I'll be super happy like this patient like in a way found their motivation
ya
okay I'm done
err what did I have for lunch ah oh ya because I was talking to haziq until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one eh eh no ya around one eh no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
mm true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars nasi lemak at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like err but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then err the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
oh ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about um just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya choa chu kang
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't oh okay I remember I went to oh cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like um it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this one is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it lah so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in choa chu kang doesn't have a shower
later like what time
err the burger err I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what ah I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella eh no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom eh the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya don't know ah it's just like I I like it that way ah
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in
oh
where
mm
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
oh okay okay okay
oh
oh okay wait what is this cafe called again
is it is it like the
but is it like in a mall or is it like in the middle of nowhere
oh wow that's interesting um so why did you guys want to go there
mm oh ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
oh and that's enough for him
mm
mm oh ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear
mm
then after that you all didn't go for dessert or anything
I think so ya oh I didn't know there was a drive through there
you and your mocha
mm mcdonald's drinks are always sweet
mm that's nice so so he pick you up from
aww that's nice
ya yesterday I just went to the hospital oh like after I gym then I went home to shower then after that I was feeling pretty lazy lah honestly so I just err ask my brother ah eh can I take the car or not then he say can go and take ya then I took the car I drive to I drove to
so I was super scared about that so like err when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there lah to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe kan I just parked right smack in front of the lift
nasi ah sorry I ate the lor mai kai then I ate the then I order three siew mai
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that lor mai kai got the like the wok hey taste ya oh my god ya so that's why like wah I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the lor mai kai
I didn't see anything at the ulu car park ah parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital kan ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
eh
I hope that we can play badminton later seh
ya
ya too windy I think too much but I think
so that err they all evaporate faster something like that lah I have no idea how the science works ah ya okay let me see what are the prompts um
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
damn what who who is that celebrity
oh
ya that's true
that is a very is hyorin right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
mm
oh damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how oh chey
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy oh
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor kan but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
mm wow that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay um do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
mm stereotypes ah
ya I get what you mean ah ya is a bit err a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that one it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is oh you malay ah you in uni ah oh so you are one of the what ah a smart malay ah they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before lah but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya lah I know I know recently also like especially during um the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so err aiya don't know lah I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like oh okay okay okay but ya like like quite sian ah to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that err everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say lah
he's on what on the ship oh
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for um youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths ah
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up lah because err even though to me lah like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe lah inshallah like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did ah I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to err and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like I I don't know ah like I just cannot cannot handle it lah ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like oh don't worry lah I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is lah ya cause err one of the mentors was telling me that like err he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
oh damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
ah ah okay let's look for one more question mm
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free eh
that's true but technically also isn't it like
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing what right ya
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that um analogy lah ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more lah ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that lah
ya oh my god my throat
hey oh ya okay then for me what was the question again ah
um my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free eh food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer um if something was free ah can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya lah like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya wah it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored leh if I were immortal
no oh my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy ah okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just um and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them lah basically
aesthetics ya sia okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift hmm will the werewolf be the shape shifting one maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to um the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then um I don't know would you rather be like

ya err
no thanks to david moyes we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back um bit our hand back
and you associated with all of them
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya ah the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about thiago he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in barcelona central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
I can't believe sia
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham a'ah
when did they ever not lost okay ah to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean ah but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
arteta
plus minus ah plus minus ah
he knows his a level above everybody else ah no but but K you know there's this two theories of
err two types of players football theory eh two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers kan
ah the likes of
guardiola
and pochettino and martinez and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis van gaal ah ajax school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis van gaal is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but err no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective ah okay err
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent ah
he does basically ah
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen ah in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis van gaal school of control
wait then then I have the flip side ah the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually merino takes everything that is strong about louis van gaal and finds the witnesses so like louis van gaal takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using merino flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing ah
bionic inter milan game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but inter milan won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is err
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's mourinho
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin ah
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick zambia lonso
err err schools that kind of control zavi iniesta chaos player
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so err he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why van gaal and cryuff although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
cryuff emphasise more on individual creativity van gaal is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what mourinho exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre ah mourinho he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
opposites outside of the spectrum for one klopp
he
klopp denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
ya ya ya swan
mm
but on Android I I don't have a four

desensitising us to sexualisation so
ten eleven years old kan
eleven years old not wearing ah so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids ah and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences eh
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing lah that's the justification ah so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world ah mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
it's not a sleazy casting call ah

pressurising you to look good in this way use this shade of colour that shade of colour and you are happily buying makeup and you're saying that you are in control of yourself and
are not independent thinkers that they are subconsciously being steered in this direction by the media by by societal pressure by the expectation to look something in a certain way

Netflix binging I've I've cleared so many shows just by watching
four five episodes a night on a weekday and I just basically every weeknight I clear four or five episodes so I started off with
when we started listing
use of my time ya ya unfortunately ya
you watch again superb show lah then
correct
yes
what
better call saul correct
I think season two you still have not ah coming to six
he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself ah ah to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am kan uh we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
morally ambiguous ah but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging tau when you put yourself in and ask yourself
ah ah ah ah ah it's a psychological phenomenon ah it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation
okay a'ah a'ah
sheer willpower ah a'ah
mm ya
a'ah a'ah but
you should lah sial dude
have you watch prison break
a whole season or all four all four seasons
followed by the movie
no
what is his name will
he didn't die ya he declared himself gay but he
okay
what why why should that be to you you should be to woman okay but err there's four seasons of prison break followed by a movie
after you watch okay after you watch after you watch the movie then you follow season five
there's a season five and that's the final season
ah so it's a four seasons
movie then season five err
that one on the way their their in the works
okay season fourteen end up somewhere around two thousand twelve or thousand thirteen
ah then the movie then two thousand seventeen they came out with with
season five
a'ah
which is and is is coming soon
I started on watching this thing called peaky blinders
peaky blinders is short ah it's only four seasons of six episodes each very short
what iPhone is that doesn't look different from previous iPhone
okay
okay
safe entry
camera ah
I scan one
I keep the browser open
mmhmm
mmhmm
really
okay
mmhmm
which is which yours
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
ya
oh you go it goes in a clockwise
ah
mm
uh huh
uh huh
so where is
oo
ya ya ya ya ya ya
as long as
a'ah
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
why
one corner
wait
oh hawker centre
a'ah a'ah correct
mmhmm
so it's not the
a'ah ya lah ya lah ya lah

right
can
oh okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then um you can
choose
eh I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically err when you
what's that called where he lives is also err stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just um
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance lah ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
oh then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is ah amendment there is ah basically um when you choose err your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things ah
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to lina everything kan send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire um all the details so that err being a typical singaporean ah we kiasu one so err once err once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it oh okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller lah basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay ah
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that lah but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like err like they're they're very busy lah so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and alina
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different lah
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday ah you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you oh close the window
ya things like that lah but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
um
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot lah ya but for me it was I chose the eh no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
um ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different ah mm different ah
wah I don't remember whether there's any charges eh
okay okay
don't need one not necessary ah they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is um it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them err I I've got work lah they will they will still will pressure you then oh but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that oh it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end what ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch oh now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point kan
mm dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say err like
it it defeat to me lah it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it lah like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends lah ya so
all weddings there will be time time time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
kan then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing lah cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding eh eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location what how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully lah it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live err a chendol station ah everything like in the mosque everything lah quite quite nice lah he paid for everything
then ya lor then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is um itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me lah is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible lah in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me ah that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their eh they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way lah you know that they want to save your money and
different person different lor ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing ah they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
err I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at bedok reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to dewi
like for me I leave it to alina like for me I leave it to alina on how you want to to but the thing is like alina also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research mah
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like eh I cannot be splitting it right down the middle ah right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like eh our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like eh I want fifty dollar my problem lah
I pay myself what that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have err chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that lah ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
mm salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
um
mm
mm
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding err expo and everything kan so it's a bit different ah
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography ah ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing lah ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
mmhmm can do that also
err I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place lah if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled lah I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
mm can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us lah
ya it is quite nice also over there um on the wedding day itself lah ya
as in your wedding day lah I want to book the indigo room over there oh no need lah ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points oh no need lah no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel mm no need no need no need
um
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well lah I would say err okay so basically
you have to see
mm yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and alina did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
wah she the that that that girl is amazing ah ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins lor all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early kan ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues lah basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about err the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important lah
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that lah
okay
mmhmm I would say you don't need to worry about the activity ah people will just take picture with you lah
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing eh no one no one cares lah
my the recent one with my with my err sister in law's brother we did at err malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem lah
no need lah okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know oh but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's wah you got a lot money
to me lah personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me lah personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements what
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own lah um cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early lah cause it's it's not fast job mah
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like wow
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
err my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
mm but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know one when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very kiasu game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like alina throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be what then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes ah and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks lah the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important lor
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right um
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff lah I would say but I like him because err he listens to what I say
ah then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional lah he listens to me lah ya
yup ya so I just walk around ah I told him to follow me ya no lah I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked lina to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need ah ya

that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you grade lah
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
huh
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays ah
kiasu
mm
orh
orh
for for one year ah
one year
mm
how much is school bus eh
hmm
ya
mm
hmm
I think should be fine
I don't know lah should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
ah
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
oh yes I forgot that I got one good news today
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes ah
ya he's present he's rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the ya is him
ya not exactly okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
one one more year and then ya I'll leave lah
ya see how it goes
ya
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids lah also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say um
ya
ya
older kids ah I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers err
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
mm
orh
mm mm mm mm
approval lah
so who decides
the deployment
okay
you see the teachers but you don't see the
people like rarely right
oh so they do teach
wah
busy ah
like
mm
trust me I think you told me before ya ya ya
mm
mm
it's set auto eh
mm mm mm mm
you say it's uh
ya
ya
ya
oo
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's um
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
uh
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing lah just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then err depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is err cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya lah I mean basically you can climb lah
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
ya like my
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone ah
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya
how to say um
I don't know what I'm saying
yes yes yes ya
ya exactly ya
ya
contented yes that's the right word ya
ya
ya
mm
ya I don't know
ya
thirty four thirty four minutes we only have about another half an hour
ya
what's that
portugal

you will love it
yes and beat you you must prepare yourself to gain like
ya
ya
ya ya ya it's a muslim
I mean not around there's only like a few
but then again because the place is quite um considered quite small lah like quite easy to travel to
no no no no it depends it depends depends on which part you're going
ya
we always make
time for it what ya
ya one place ya
ah
mm

I don't know what's the word
ya my sense of coffee
ya ya
ya
ya
but somehow I manage to
ya
I can do this like
ya
ya
ya
ya but the thing this management and you know all these bosses and how people think like once they see oh you can do it then they will like push you even further and further you know
ya
they want to know random conversations
how the conversation are
uh if I bring my laptop I mean I just change my laptop also
ya
my new laptop is inside my bag
err it's a

okay
so
hi
uh this is madir and this is my speaking partner zaini
um zaini say something
hi okay so let's look at the prompts um
ah
how are you today
okay
okay so let's
ah
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay lah that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
uh the
oh the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but uh it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow lah but
I suppose um ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind um
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect um you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult lah and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
uh
ha okay
ya
uh huh
uh huh
huh okay
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let's just
what do you think of the house ah
huh
ya ya what do think of the house ah
mmhmm
keep talking ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean for me ya lah I mean it's I do feel
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to kan like I mean like I've always been living in yishun
and then now moving to tampines so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me lah ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
mm
ya
ya lah
ya
uh okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions lah it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
uh huh
uh first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know uh really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand lah
and then the second
would be obviously
oh but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
hmm
mm
like would be health
um you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
uh and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
um
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only lah but the buttons ge ge which is good lah
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
hmm
iran
yang paling digemari
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like mm ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that one was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
um we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
mm where they were that was really really very nice and then um
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went tehran
we didn't have a guide like what we had uh in isfahan and yazd
eh no no no we didn't have yazd it's shiraz sorry ya
but
ya lah we didn't have a guide lah
would have been nice lah if we had a guide ah but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
huh
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to bordeaux so many times
oh ya
mm
cranny
mmhmm
uh biarritz
no yes we did we went to biarritz we went to cannes
yes
then from bordeaux we went ya we went to uh dune du pilat
and then we went to biarritz
ya and then we went to arcachon ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
uh huh
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course lah it has to be attractive in my way lah
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
hmm and you know the person's kind of vibe ah not not not personality or character lah because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well ah
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go deep
yes ya
yes
eh no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
soalan pertama fahamkan anda
no
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
mmhmm okay
why
uh huh
ah okay
uh huh
uh
um
design
uh
um
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
uh would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question um
okay
uh
uh
uh talented
I have no idea what talented means uh is in in in malay um
uh
ya tom holland
mmhmm
ah
uh huh
actually
uh huh
okay um
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right um how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
um
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could um not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample um opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
um
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
um
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know uh make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree uh unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done wah
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
ah oh
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like uh rustic to me
okay
actually kan
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
eh thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly ah
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
um
uh
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place
just
you know the wall
actually I was thinking ah like dining area
or just this wall
just this wall
the store wall
okay lah

it's quite filling
okay
okay unless we just keep it to five lor like
ya
ya
reunion school reunion

vegan
okay can
wait when when is the dinner
oh
oh oh ya
mm
okay lor
then like that
we can dinner on twenty eight or twenty nine
at buffet town
hopefully
could be
okay
eh but you said at west
oh
we going two days one night ah
oh
wait twenty eight is err
monday sunday sunday lah I think it's sunday lah sunday monday cause every setup he got one weekend he needs to clear
ya
no I think it's sunday monday
eh maybe monday tuesday
oh rates
then he say it's like seven hundred online
the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference ah
oh
lame
speaking of travel
of course lah I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer hais that was
global warming
too bad
okay lah but at least you went out so still okay
okay lah
then like that
hmm more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
oh ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that um what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
mm
huh
ah
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay lah probably
it's gonna be better
huh but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young lah
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest lah is like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
ah I was looking at this youtube um
the youtube is from america lah
yes
so it's like um
she
went to a nursery with
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear lah I don't know lah it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
there's a lot of different plants that um she feature lah
and then err the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent what no meh
no it's like
ah it's like a
um
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
ya it's like um apparently when the leaves are young
like
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though ah
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
ya it's quite tall
yes
mmhmm
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
cause I think it's like um you see
in a
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think um
um and there's no leeway lah
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
it like I think
it's not so healthy because
in their own way of keeping healthy lah so I think in that sense err that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
they actually force them to actually
mm
mm
ah
okay is okay lah but I think before
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation lah
mm mm
mm mm
err
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
mm
mm
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those um
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
um minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of err amenities for them to study which are like the laptop lah the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
girl in
ah ah
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her lah but for like elders other younger kids leh then how
ya
mm
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today lah I think there were also reports plus err like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
um
thought of
like
okay lah the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans what just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans what so it should be
um
encompass in all this care lah
but I think like
mm
mm
ya
ya even um
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
iphone ten
but more physically lah so
err that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
mm
no lah I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of lah I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
oh is it
oh
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on lah
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay lah I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
aiyo but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
hais
don't know what's gonna happen and
mm
I think
how can nature be a problem
that's
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay lor if you say so lor
ah
then there is a big issue lah
but I think like
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
but
ya lah but I still think lah confirm under black market so it's not that much lah
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything one
really what
mm
ya lah but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom what
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already what
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that what they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no lah I think
then animal go home lor
take the bus lor
no lah I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
buy one get one free
I think they kill it leh
ah
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also what and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
ah
you have seen it before what
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
should google it up the prayer plant
and err it's an indoor plant
err
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay lah
technically not really eh it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
um
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
ah ah
really meh I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it err refreshes the air ah NASA say one
really
ah
ah ah
true lah
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
huh
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
shoots ah shoots
oh
okay lah but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
okay wait ah
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
that is true hor
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong um so
what sort of plant got meh
coconut tree but it's not
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
oh my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
a bit different lah the milkshake
ya but anyway it's quite um it's quite a journey
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them um water the plant
like it they pouring into the side lah not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like wow like that ah
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk what
scotch tap hor it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
so I was quite amazed like oh okay you can actually do that
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care lah
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
no one lah not the standard issue plan lah and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
hmm
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat jinjja chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
err our christmas gathering lor exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill lah whatever lah
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
hais
what's the theme
more than thirty
oh I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny ah charlotte lah
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
err ya ah
doing comms ah
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay lah not bad lah then sense a different lor different vibe here

it's I I don't remember but it's like it's based it's really
it's really like justice league tau

huh
managing a business
it's called business management
is this like
business management with comms
ya just like one question like the running of it you know lah
it's quite interesting but like
with like everything going on at work like I wonder if it's even worth it you know like what's the point of it all
I guess
like what's the point to like doing anything
if the world is going to fall apart
business
oh that time
ya
yes still still there was still some profits ah it's that
ya now I'm just too busy with school so I cannot do that or inside job
mmhmm
uh now I stop already actually
ya I stop already
err a month maybe
and I didn't spend that much lah
I spend on three tens only
no recently ah recently only three tens
ya I better not gonna sell anytime soon ah honestly
feels like it's it's so much time and like
I I'm not gonna realise any any profits if I sell now definitely
cause right the state of the game now it's like so bad
oh then
honestly ah if it comes wrong then I'm I'm just like whatever man like
ya I'm really just like kind of like given up on the game already
ya just like I mean
the money somehow translate to that so okay lah
ya
ya
ya they should at least like I mean they should at least like balance it out what
I don't know like to keep like the business going and shit like that
I mean like you still owe it to but your customers will be like
they sian about how you manage the game
like reservice
ya
so annoying all these capitalist vultures
they are they are the main reason why is is this pandemic to you state that you please
there's always sole reason why
ya
orh
when was that
really
oh
what
huh
what the hell but it's still manual
no I think it's just him
it's always just him honestly
ya I mean like how the hell it's right go over like with like seven extra gig like I literally played with him few days back
that was fun
I like the skins the new skins are really nice now
right
huh
no lah
teenage mutant ninja turtles lah
no I would wish it was spongebob
who would be spongebob sia
gary
snail
snail god eh
okay I ask you this
if you were to be given a chance to choose between good looks or fit body which would you go for
for yourself and another person
as in like your soul part your
your dream partner
think if it were me
between good looks and a fit body right I would go for their credit card
that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think
no I think good looks also I feel like good looks is more more sustainable
if you're superficial
if you're superficial
ya
ya I think after awhile you will get tired of looking at a person's body
I don't know think face is like more more personal and like more adoring right
ya
like
looking good ya
so what you're going to do after this
today or any other day
orh
you shave it jer lah
really as in like shave
how sia
when less less care about
why sia think you look good what
shaved head
but mostly netflix ah
but do you still play smite
why sia
oh right right right right right
no
I mean I played yesterday
ya
but I play alone ah cause they they didn't call
ya I mean I I did say I say in the group
but then ilyas said he cannot play then I thought he he just he's outside or something then apparently he can't he can't play
annoying
but now your macbook is fine right or you don't not playing with that
you didn't try ah
mm I don't know about that
god
house with a farm attached
with a garage attached
with a arcade attached
it's all considered one
ya actually ya that that's that's that's really good
ya he have a house we can just chill inside doesn't leave it for anywhere
ya
people only people just work they get a house and then they die
ya but like
it should be free right
like houses housing
like nobody ask
before they just work
like this is the place
and you need a place to stay
so you make a place for yourself
that's why should be free
yishun
island eh wow
oh
uh what's the island what's the island by punggol called ah
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by punggol I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called lah
oh yes coney island coney island yes yes yes
it's it's very near here
ya I can go
eh let's go
I feel like going I want to look for that cow
nobody knows
ya
I think it's more interesting how the cow ended up there
I guess ya
oo maybe ya
I guess what happened
I think I was thinking that like
kampong glam
wah serious ah oh I think I heard of that
eh
wasn't it our
oh was it
it's the one that you posted on instagram right
the one the girl with the bangs is it
right
oh ya I remember that
mm
ya
but
were they trying to colonize area
orh
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
wah that's cool
mm
wah
that's really nice eh I want I want to move there sia
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big ah
the place
orh orh
orh so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside ah
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone ah
I mean alone with her friends
all the nature reserves lor
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near mandai area there it's like a hidden
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
yes
actually I don't know eh
the animals all wear masks
the features ah
oh ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
pulau semakau the place coney island
ya
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you lah
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something kan
thing is three years is quite okay lah kan
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats lah
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
oh ya
I forgot ah
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
oh ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from yishun
you never went
huh
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four ah
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
orh
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what huh
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and changi airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on changi airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
hais
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be uh happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
oh shit
genie
you eh what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
huh
oh never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay lah I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
ah
what would I want
ah
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
uh
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
oh my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long eh from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
oh shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
oh ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
oh ya and that as well
uh huh
oh ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough what
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay ah
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all lah but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
ah
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
cat
ya
ya only when I
only when I go to like the east east east area like
pasir ris or tampines then
huh
oh no I haven't seen him for very long sia
ya cause when I've been like super busy with my assignments
ya but I'm like
I'm like going to
uh I'm planning to like going to see him soon ah also
wild cats
oops
sometimes I like my bed I'm like
ah I know what would be better me lying with a cat
just like cuddling
ya it is like sitting in a chair
ya
I think she's like
also like very
uh she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now eh
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
oh ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya
but he had fun
ya I guess I mean he's he's not really like scared of it right is he
like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do lah
mm ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
uh human civilizations will be like
uh
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example lah then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like uh like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
uh issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
oh no lah like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff lah like taking care
uh like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like ah I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like uh like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
oh yes yes yes
that's so sad
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
if I was the judge I would say that
just
oh ya that's like really
oh why
okay I think we're gonna be done soon
ya okay ah next time ah
see you

hey how are you
almost two months ago
kan
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
mmhmm
a'ah seh
ah sia like a blessing in disguise ah eh
okay lah
you heard
but
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now lah but um you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done ah
ya actually I am most of the time only like err two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
cause there are some like letters from err the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time lah
a few hours at least
in a week
ya lah I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
mm
huh as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
oh my gosh
mm
ya I know you always do lah you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere lah
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
oh
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you ah like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age um
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one um app away or one call away so
mm
is it I never heard of that before
mmhmm
oh my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
oh
mmhmm
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good ah
as cliche as it sounds lah
um healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my err to get my workout in ah on a daily
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it ah
ya
mmhmm
oh is it
mmhmm
what's the average ah what's the ideal
that's normal ah ah
that plays a part ah
ya mm
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
mm
ya lah it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more um you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad what I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face sial babe
oh no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
okay lah
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on lah
it's like that
ya
oh yes it's right there
you know me too well
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it eh is it K one or nursery eh
err K
there seven
oh
primary five eh
primary five ya
oh my gosh wait primary five
and then now we are like oh my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
even during school we don't really talk to each other kan
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
mmhmm
ah
mmhmm
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
mm
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know um from what you're telling me
like
the effort
is only at your end
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times lah but
you know like um in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow that really open up like
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay lah um being in a relationship of friends ah like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this um saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like err people come and go
and especially when the err when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men lah but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women eh I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay um you know
um you shouldn't get back to your err to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly kan err maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience lah but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense ah I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up ah
mm
mm
aww
aww so cute
a book like a diary
oh right okay
oh my gosh
eh but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
eh that is actually a good thing like um it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know um on paper
mm
then it hit you ah
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like um
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
um
mm
mm
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up ah then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
oh my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
mm
ya lah like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up eh not not the cause of your okay lah somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay lah I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya lah but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
aww
wow you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
eh oh my gosh
I mean
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly eh when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
err it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead lah it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on err cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay lah
you know
but err do you know if he's attached now or not
oh my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
oh is it
ya I don't give a shit anymore sia I can't even remember
eh isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah um let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
eh you don't don't say that about yourself lah you are amazing
mm mm
oh my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
eh ya oh my god I almost forgot about our makisan
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging

I feel that err more
responsible lah right ya and then you also try to manage your time and priorities mm
ya exactly correct correct
mm
I don't know I mean I've been
err looking at
err design ya design err I think recently lah I just picked up like err cause err
I'm like

like ya to get into that
which I don't know it just kind of pick my
my mind yes uh ya say can say so
mm ya

err there's this cafe I think err
there's this shop I think called squisito ah ya they got some italian pasta all that like my favorite ah
ah that's why that's true also lah that's why
ya make reservations lah
ya but so far then maybe apart from that
I will just err
uh
ah ya they did err I recently when I went they had this
position lah ya like two people
ya ya they block the seats ah ya so err okay lah I mean like you you I I
then like
mm
ya ya ya I know
okay lah not bad
got a few movies ya
mm
mm what
one thing that make me annoyed ah
that's why so it's not easy mah
mm
ya correct correct
mm mm
mm
ya true lah
I see
ya understand
agree
mm ya ya
so like
mm
is there any of your oldest
the the longest I mean how to say err
like
mm
oh
mm
orh
I see nice nice ya I mean for now I'm also having
like I still keep in contact with my secondary school friends lah let's see my primary school
my primary school
my primary school friends
my primary school friends err it's like err
they are not
they are not
err in contact with me much because they
they are quite busy with their own lifestyle already then I also not that close now with them
ya
ya we keep in touch lah like of course ah like we go jamming and all
lah together so like ever since then
ya we still
ya we're still close lah
ya we also ah
mm
ya
ya ya ya like like
I ask hi how are they going
so ya sometimes it's good to ask lah how they are doing
so ya
mm
mm mm no lah
mm mm
ya
I see a'ah
opposite err not really I'm a very dynamic
I have a dynamic taste in music lah okay
I think cause sometimes I like loud music but sometimes also like like like indie also
ya introvert
ya sometimes loud music helps you destress mm so I decided and also
ya it's like
err emotional ah ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
ya you can express your your feelings lah kan
just
lah
ah service ah
ya
so uh huh
struck an idea that that
ya so uh this is one way lah we can
err bring
bring it up
to them ya so
mm venture
I think
uh about
and
and stuff we are
err more more in depth
for the meantime so
ya I'll just use this opportunity lah kan
mm
ya I can see
err physically so we must monitor them by whatsapp or like ya like to liaise err with my contacts over there lah
uh ya
I think that's mainly what the the difficulties are the rest not so much
ya
ya
no lah I have a few a few friends they are doing it together with me ya
ya
one of them is not is a housewife lah so she she's just doing some side business also then ya so she's also doing this lah then for me and my other friend we are like working full time
ya so ya like ya this is like our part time lah time management so far okay
try to err minimise our workload lah
mm from day to day
ya
but uh I think it's okay lah it's a feasible business I think ah what about you like do you have anything like you want to start up with
or mm
mm
mm oh
nice orh nice
uh huh
mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya hopefully lah
hopefully
ya
a'ah
mm ya ya
opportunity for us
mm
kan
okay
ya honeymoon mm maybe consider ya
like that but actually err can say I'm more of a sightseeing kind of person lah
ya
I think
mm
ah ya that's way road trip yes
ya so
so
it's it's good lah to bring them
err better I mean
ah
ah okay lah interesting
ya
mm mm ah ya lah
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season ah mmhmm
mm
mm
I see actually no I mean
err spring is considered err winter right or is it after winter sorry kan ya but I I mean I personally also like winter lah
but err winter like it's very fun lah cause
aesthetically I would prefer err autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice lah ya
mm ya correct
mmhmm ya ya is like
once the this is all over kan
mm like you really mm
wow
it was it was actually during autumn lah that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
they are very err
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you one without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire lah about them
then so ya singapore err ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya lah but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way lah right
since young so
that's why
ah then orh
there's the bullet train lah ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no lah I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train lah it's just the high speed train which
like normal lah I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's uh the food
really
mm ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places what so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan

oh oh oh
orh okay okay
yes cause I I my mum okay I he this person works as the receptionist the bell the bell worker or something like that so he was the one who were assigned rooms to the guests
so he said usually
he did mention the highest I don't know whether this one story where the highest level or one of the top levels they closed it off
they don't let anybody in
ya but basically this guy was saying this guy was saying ah
uh no he didn't say the top ten floors he just say one of the high floors they closed it up cause of there's a lot of incidents where people encounters uh but
so I think you were the unlucky one
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
uh huh
I have to go home later
and your house is freaking temple beside and with like a freaking you know the the temple I oh
it doesn't make me feel better it doesn't
uh
okay I mean like I guess I'm gonna take Grab later
to the
I can feel it when you were mentioning that you had no neighbours
and then you could hear children laughing and all that
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I wouldn't want to go back with that story
creepy seh
okay
I did that I did that um
I did that uh what happened was when in korea I actually encounter some things supernatural so I actually recite the quran ya
I experience
uh huh uh huh yes
yes yes
wah
crazy man

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character lah
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
okay
so new sia
ah uh
mm
mm
mmhmm
clear about what he's getting
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
okay
mm because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
cough up lah information
mm
mm
go into that yes
ya
okay
ya which you you might not but you might not agree ah
ah ah mmhmm
ya ya lah but I guess baby steps then after that
did you did you specifically say that
ya mm
hmm
ah
mm
a'ah seh
okay so
oh so just the informal ya
ah
ah
mm
you said
mm
mm
ah
okay
dayah's ah ah
mm mm
so fed up ah this type of thing
I don't think he even thinks like this lah
oh
foresight a'ah
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not salim I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
haiya
I mean I haiya I don't know what to feel about this
ya
send ya
must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether uh I
pushed or zina will be pulled down
err big personality how to say not big lah firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
your life will turn out well
ah
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to dayah
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with izat
huh you talk about marriage to izat like what
this was before lah
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but zina can also ask you the same then why and why you and izat is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and izat are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya lah
ya lah because also also dayah always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya lah
ya ya
hidayah is clamping her down lah
ya ya
huh
ah ah ah where
you said that okay
okay
you said that ah then
ya
it's very hard and you will often require a certain mm
change of life events or certain

K and K got that
you can put your earpiece back on
so anyway um how has your work been
oh oh okay okay okay
how long was it eh the practicum
huh so fast
mm
oh ya okay ya ya ya no no err what was I
suddenly
mm
oh
oh
oh no
oh
mm
mm
mm ya that that's why
ya
ya oh so
they offered you full time is it
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
that's good that's refreshing
mm
mm
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh ya ya ya ya ya that's mm awkward
mm
mm
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
mm
wait that that that's a good thing kan or
mm
mm
ya
oh okay
or people with experience lah so they don't have to train so much
independent
mm
I see
ya
mm LOL
ya
ya that's true
oh that's a lot
that's why siao
mm
ya
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
oh so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
oh
ya
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
so you're not gonna take take up their
mm
mm
oh okay
ya
mm
ah okay okay
ah
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like oh no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
mm make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
mm
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
mm dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in uh you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
mm it's been good I am teaching
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
um switch lah so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like oh my god
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me lah cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you um err I need I'll be like err oh sit down okay or like err
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want lah
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
mm be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
you know my period's coming
tau like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came uh okay lah like out of the six of us only like four people eh two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
mm
uh yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
there's
I'm hoping that aiya I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
mm
ah okay
oh
I see okay good that I
don't then
mm
oh then hers is how much
mm
mm
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby kan
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
ya so she also like told me to just
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
mm
oh that is so
oh my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
you know
it's just like ugh gross
way lower than you thought
oh
mm and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high mm
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something uh
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think inhan sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now is any super heavily actually near my house
oh mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me lah I mean like you heard you heard my okay okay
mm
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that lah it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not kan so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans oh chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
err ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just ugh celebrity
I guess
is it mm I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
mm
oh
mm ang mo kio park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
mm ya and then there's
dairy farm nature park
and this one quite
oh eco green
like would it be very is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know afiqah afiqah you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
eh were you staying at our table
mm
she got married uh I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite um because like err
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
um they only allow like ten people
mm and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it lah like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
mm I don't think so
oh is the is the one that her long term the one that always eh ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
mm
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
mm
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
um
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
mm makes more sense
oh
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working ah then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
mm
oh like the dad is more chill lah usually
and also like it's a culture thing also lah like oh you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
mm
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time lah to like uh you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
oh was it with his girlfriend also
serious oh is it because of his surprise birthday party uh
so what have you decided
eh how do you get her number ah I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
wah your friend is so going to feel betrayed sia
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
so dah decide
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
orh
but you think he okay or not
serious ah
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza lah
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever lah
oh
okay
oh forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
oh that's good deal man
eh can you share the link with me
mm
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
alah
oh okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
oh and fly kite
oh
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
oh but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter lah that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go ah that's the point
mm
actually that day
mm
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know fuh
okay actually to me lah is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like Razi did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places ah then what happen ah
oh he will ah okay okay um because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
oh okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice lah of the girlfriend
mm
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay uh Marina Marina Bay lah kan
Barrage if you got no car you go Sentosa
oh because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay lah
oh okay then Marina Barrage makes sense lah
yes yes yes
mm
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have meriahness if there is
I mean aiya for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true lah I I mean no I personally don't like Sentosa
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for Sentosa
earlier lah
oh it's a weekend ah
ah
okay
oh ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
orh
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before lah in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
ah okay
ah
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
Tampines
not the other side of the Singapore right
ah
ah okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
ah near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
oh my god
anyway motor is convenient ah
but I think
oh really
so early ah it's indoor what
oh you mm okay lah I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay lah
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
uh I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow lah huh
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people lah so I always leave it to other people
oh ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like ah
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better ah
food
okay all growing boys
ya but to me mm okay lah for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
oh okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
mm then what she say
oh my god
uh then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
uh mee tom yum mm one of them
no because now
ah
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason lah eh let's say
um
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time what
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme ah
oh it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
for what
are you serious
ya lah
so that you can focus on your work ah
you don't have any other friends meh
you have right
yeah
oh you got further subset of your
mm
I know I know you know I know I know already lah
a'ah
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap ah
ya lah
orh
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
wah I should make friends with this friend of yours lah
ah ya lah
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also lah
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you ah it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay lah no loss to him
yeah
yeah
so is no to him is no loss lah so that's why he's like that
do you do they know that you meet each other
oh they know ah so
ah okay
yeah and I know why you don't wanna go
yeah
oh confirm ah
it's confirmed
mm

right the indian muslim one and the that one right ya
okay lah
hmm hmm
I don't know I don't I don't miss in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
oh Marissa Shu you never go before ah
I think if you go with Shu also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
oh
ya lah
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say ah
oh but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant lah but okay lah I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
mm
but they make you feel included lah
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that Shiqah Ad Razi group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean Aidil they all but I rarely get to meet him lah but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends sia oh and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
ah
but I think two person is much more better leh I feel lah
don't know lah I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
aiya but they going week weekend ah
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces seh
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
ah no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary ah
try ah
cannot ah
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who ah I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part eh
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
oh crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay what
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared sia
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
oh my god okay
oh
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
oh so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
ah he will say
a bit meh
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be Aidil lah up till now
actually actually is true eh
and then his mum will be left
aww
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
oh I don't tell her so that uh she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who ah
ah I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take ah I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
Kartini will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then ah whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already lah this one
then uh I remember lah the one in my secondary school is this
um very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
oh ya we we I tell you we are nerds what we can spend in library from nine eh nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
um was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so eh
no I'm busy for but I think on weekends when I have no
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it ah
crash study crash
crash lah they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
uh so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level ah in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the uh after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask uh hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
oh
surprise
cannot lah sia I will be stressed
okay lah
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age ah
I realised I
eh don't tell this to Farid ah cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days lah
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
oh my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort ah
drill
bit
ah ya
oh shit
are you serious
switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level I took O level I take I took sec two O okay
shaved plastic shave
yes
oh my gosh
this one laughed
oh ya actually it's true ah a drill is quite safe ah
you ask her it it kiap the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
wah that's a nice phone is that Ada's phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek lah we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay uh
oh in the morning when you come then you ask each other eh
geography lah geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater huh
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level ah
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
ah
ah because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
uh yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
oh sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
uh arts uh sports and
uh I don't know geek lah I would categorise uh debate as geek lah I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood lah it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek lah okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool lah debater oh I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why eh I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game um minefield
eh that one is I tell you ah
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject lah
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch oh
like how curious a a kid is oh why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the oh so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I oh the only reason why I went for that course was because ah ah ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
uh who err so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late uh we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up lah basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
ah
eh come on lah I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he hor we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say eh you know ah
actually the head prefect saw my face already ah just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl ah
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class lah
eh so and so so and so saw my face already know wah if he see that I disappear already ah sure he will mark me one
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school lah sia
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
walao eh this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention lah
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually uh supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself lah
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no lah of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
oh
a'ah
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
oh my god
oh but the discipline master doesn't know you personally ah
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai kia ah
all cannot make it sia
ah
huh
eh actually primary school classes are the worst to manage ah
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths ah okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that one especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun lah they are innocent ah so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can ah if ya

don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
um I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand ah most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together ah
oh berry van eh
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya lah so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then lah my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya um and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
ah despite my aunts' protestations
and ya lah so he jump ah he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply lah kan you got there
and once you are done ya lah I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand um
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match ah so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
err
eh did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
ah was that the first time I felt snow
err
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun lah
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine eh
ya
K lah how chocolate is the best lah
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
ah apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
woo shiok ah
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food ah kan
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
err
ya
um you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
um you can even decide on the spot that hey I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way um
what they do is they drive
to penang
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border oh you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
krabi or fly to phuket
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay lah I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience lah of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship lah kan
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no lah I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm lah
ah
oh ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas ah
um there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers ah that's why
ah meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from ah
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
mm ya
and the best donuts in the world
eh do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis lah the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
um
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique um overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay lah I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world lah
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya oh and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains eh
did they grill that one grill kan
I think it was grilled and then they put um brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that ah
ya that one
eh there was something that I thought about um oh oh oh oh oh oh um london um
the devil brownies ah
ya that was a random find ah no we went to that
that weekend market
um I wouldn't say it's a random find lah because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
ah correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there err these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons ah so these dragons are
um so ya she pitch her brownies to them ah
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
err she used that as part of her advertisement lah
ah but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
ah noodle oodle um that's just
soup ah
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos ah so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
ah the price the price is way cheaper than nandos ah
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab ah
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
ah yes
eh the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name ah a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice ah
ya what else ah
what else was nice that we have
oh buffet that that buffet was power
eh that was a nice chance upon ah
that was not in our initial plan lah because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
um ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay lah it's a saving grace lah
it's a saving grace because I think
um those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles ah
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian lah at least oh that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
kan
ya cheaper lah ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands err on prada
understand ah it's still thousands eh
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay lah
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major lah the and the two australia
ah
oh
err
slide down the slope ya
best ah
fifty
mm
oh
ya
the beaches err jog my memory again where did we go
oh sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay lah I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
um
oh oh ya ya ya
ah
but it's hot ah
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have err
two thousand let me recall ah when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
um we went to travel around the areas lah so we went to spain um
specifically we went to madrid lah
so err I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
mm ya
um I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one um
so when we reach belgium
um we thought that the bus station uh at that belgium to the airport was quite near lah
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely ah
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
um
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour lah but sixty kilometres away ya kan so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there ah
this was the start lah almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated lah we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind ah he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind err I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros lah basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation kan
and then by the time we reach there he
uh maybe three quarters ah
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got lah and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed lah maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey ah
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight lah but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and uh I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you lah
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid lah ah but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
err I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think ah
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
ah so dah happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
oh I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each ah
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it ah
ya
power ah
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ah like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
ah yup
true
who came up to us
say assamualaikum and started to err to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said oh actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working ah so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then um you know went back went to spain to work lah
ya working overseas is something
okay lah not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months ah of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close ah but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome ah to the point that I felt that hey
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both ah
okay so um when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
um the or the muslim students association they were quite
um vibrant and there are very active lah
so um I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them lah
because when I were went there also um
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short ah

huh

I'm good I'm good
I just finished exams
and gotten my results
fail
to like err online exams no no I'm I'm like not a huge fan of all this online stuff at all I hate it I really really hate it
I was like
ah really cannot I really cannot cause I'm type of person ah who like um prefers everything like to be there in the traditional way ah right like physically seeing your lecturer lecturer and then like taking down notes physically
like like I can't can't do I can't do it I can't do the virtual thingy I really I really don't find it like um
productive at all for me throughout the whole semester
what about you what about you
mmhmm
mm
ah
mm it's
still not the same right
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
eh but serious ah forty eight hours
oh my god
uh uh uh
mm mm
mmhmm wow
mm okay I see I see eh uh but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long eh
uh
oh okay
mm mm mm mmhmm
wow five sections
mm mm mm
mm not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
ya is it what you using
mm
mm that's why
okay never mind
can lah but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
like there's like a bit like
anyway right um
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then um ah she also specified lah like um the uh
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard ah I I don't know it's like um it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that um
ya
eleven essays
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way way ahead of um the the the the submission period
lah cause I cause I honestly feel that um the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say kan it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like uh my back was like crying for help
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your um attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like err I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse eh and then like um like like like uh
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I like I like same as you ah I expected like worse cause I feel like um some of the modules they were like quite uh heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very um drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like mm like I was quite satisfied with um my results lah cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being uh quite lenient lah
ya ya
ya
uh huh
mmhmm
uh huh
eh you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
cannot ah
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
oh
ya
ah ah ah
uh huh uh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mmhmm
mmhmm
ah cause
for me like ah for me right um
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
she was like as like for like every week
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy um course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students ah I I honestly feel that way I mean
ah in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful lah
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
so I was like ah it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
especially when like
um like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating kan
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
ya ya ya
ya ya ya I mean
oh okay that's early I mean
we just finished exams right
mmhmm
uh huh ah oh same same
same I'm taking malay also ya
ya but level two cause I took the level one already
mmhmm
ah

mm mm
oh
ya ya ya ah so it's not so draining right cause one
so I just got in so maybe like my classes will start tomorrow I think
ya so ya
but then right how's for you ah
ya
ya
ha ha ha
uh huh uh
mm
sorry what good place

this year
mmhmm
me
uh I would usually I don't know I do I do I don't really keep track of what I do I would just I don't really keep track of what I do but like if I were to remember correctly like on like a normal days
ya
ya
like really anything I will just like switch up to like a lot of a lot of things
now cause I really I don't know uh then this my daily ah most of the time I think I think I spend all my time watching random videos
if not I spend my time on social media I spend a lot of my time on social media
uh
I
social media oh
I don't know is it
ya ya ya ya ya ya
like it
sometimes people like express their opinions like openly kan
kan
ya
they will just
ya ya ya exactly exactly
kan kan kan kan
ya
ya ya ya
ah
uh huh uh huh ya ya ya ya
mm
mmhmm mmhmm ya ya ya
cause like
it's like ya I mean I know what to say
okay what
mm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya cause for me right um I I I sometimes that I really I know what to say I know what to say it's just that I don't know if I will be able to word it in a way that people understand where I'm coming from you know
mm I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like um people reply and they have like err like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like oh no I would I will never do that I mean even though like
kan
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly oh really I mean then
mmhmm
uh huh
a'ah
ah ah yes yes yes
ya ya I mean
mm mm mm mm
um sometimes sometimes
mm cause you feel that sometimes as much as you enjoy reading like people's opinions right you feel that sometimes people are just like the the opinions that you read or whatever tweets that people tweet right it's sometimes if you feel like they screaming at you I don't know sometimes I feel like everyone is being too expressive about everything
sometimes for me ya like it's like ah sometimes I feel like ah I get I get tired sometimes I get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like uh just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like oh okay can can already ah then you know activate back and then like okay already
ya cause I feel that sometimes like as much as there are a lot of like healthy discussions online there's still like those people who like to force the opinions on other people which is of course not healthy like you know and these are people like you find like
uh
it's like uh like I mean
ya I mean like sometimes you like I mean I get what you want to say but then sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that people won't like have that same opinion as you you know
you know
mm mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
ya ya ya
ya ya
eh
what

you will be open to it ah interesting interesting mm I don't know cause
hais I I feel like
ya cause
I
I mean I would say my non-existent love life lah as of right now
so ya
maybe maybe maybe if I'm like desperate enough then maybe lah
maybe like really like reach a certain age then I think I should get married and I don't have anyone then maybe ah I will resort to that but like
like I think I have other things to like think about like right now like like I need I need to figure out what I want to do with my degree
it's like mm not much ideal for me ah cause I feel that I don't even have time for myself like I'm just so busy with school so like to to have like someone in my life right now it's like um
ya it's not that it's going to distract me ah it's just that I don't I don't know if I can actually fully commit to it you know
ya it's more of that cause like you know obviously school would come first I just so busy with school I'll just be so caught up with school I don't think I would have time for my significant other if I were to ever have one like right now
ya for now for now lah
but we're like what like what age like do you think you get married
mm
ah after your studies
like twenty three
I thought so too

mm mm mm mm
I think
I'm like entering final year and like look at my look at my love life it's just crying for help so it's like no I think um if possible then I would say I would give myself like hopefully the next five years or so
minimum
like maybe to build like my career first and everything then I can think about other stuff
eh it's good catching up with you though
mm ya you know when you don't have like classes
okay then bye take care
bye

okay I think we're recording
err so my name is Umar and my conversation partner today is
so
so okay obviously okay I start eh so basically um
then after that um when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in Jakarta err celebrating Chinese new year lah
um the the the hype so called or the whole issue err it it went up and then
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore um and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then um the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and uh at first I was going to work and slowly um you see more and more people
um we were eventually taken over by um okay eh at first it was China lah and then second it was Singapore
at first ah this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries uh in Italy
is the highest lah so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
err but that's how I remembered my experience um when it first started err and how at that point of time I was
let's put it like um I wasn't employed anymore err after this whole situation so now looking for job lah
some authority figure ah
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
ya and
I think
and say that uh you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen err
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say err I understand
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that err gone viral for no reason
um
Hadi dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see Hadi kan
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny ah but I saw the article lah I think Mothership covered this article about him
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes kan
because if you think about it um just the fact that during this whole uh circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
err actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
err the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
mm mm
mm well I have this opinion about uh all these food delivery ah so to my understanding ah
but err food delivery eh so I feel that um it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all um
and they are blue err blue collar workers kan so think about this for a second eh to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to um like basically if you apply kan most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for uh the lower income group to catch up
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it kan so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar err job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about err food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day lah for example on her electric err wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is ah okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is um you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet lah
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to err
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway um with regards to that uh there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
err err employment
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis lah in singapore so whether you are uh as mentioned before whether you are
err low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide kan
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver kan
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab err you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your err err picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really err let's say you already have a bicycle lah let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
so it it simplifies a little bit
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
it has that sort of it extended flexibility ah and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way lah it's just something I just thought about recently
maybe err do a three hour trip err three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home lah so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
uh as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that um a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such uh active um kind of employment especially for the lower income uh people to help a bridge to the higher income people
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
err it does
um so during the circuit breaker period of pe was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing um did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery err did you meet anyone or
oh okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
no lah if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say eh I'm doing this err exam err next week
err I pay you two hundred dollars lah just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay pe
seriously
right well characters is something inevitable
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
I think also it depends on school as well ah because when I was in uni uh um a lot of people who went to like me kan they err
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
so in a way you can balance oh out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but err
sometimes err if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
err for a couple of years you actually um understand and appreciate what err higher academia can bring compared
to your peers err in school at the moment kan even for myself kan if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and um if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or uh it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
um you know it's the uncertainty of err okay lah
you know if I don't do well then don't do well lah you know but uh once you are in a position where you are out
is very exhausting and um some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful err well kudos them
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks lah toilet lah
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people um
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
err I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
um if doubly is even a word for studying
so aiya I mean so
I don't know eh ultimately it is a state of mind lah so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type err Foodpanda pro
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but err if you go now it's definitely available
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well Nurul didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker lah so it's a different story but for those people who
suspect until the end of the year ah
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went Jakarta once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February what
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in err late January it was Chinese new year I had to go Jakarta but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May err April or something ah it didn't happen anyway so ah whatever lah
just need a break cause okay if you think about it kan people other than Singapore
who
ah that one is err he was so desperate for diving that one also is
ya
yup
nope it says err fifty seven minutes
on my timer
ya
so man I don't know now
you you're only as old as you feel
sleep is for the weak having said that I got a class tomorrow at nine thirty
what am I doing recording this at two in the morning
you you go for more class I'm going for volunteer class you are going for to get re-educated upgrade education
you paid for
I use I use the SkillsFuture is paid for
I still had to pay about err thirty plus dollars that's all just uh a top up ah
twenty five thousand dollars ah jer
I paid more for my education in my uni hello
but but I already paid my loan so I'm good no problem
what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
hmm
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour

all right
ya
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit ah
is it
shit
I don't know what went wrong ah honestly ah honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic ah I was like
even if I was the instructor
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit ah
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike ah
but apart from that
I think
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know ah cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
and I accepted it lah ya but today
um I started out with the mini circuit
like it was me and it was that that that that girl lah so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance ah maybe today I might pass ah that kind of thing
but no
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
then I said oh then
then why I cannot the same ride again ah
so
oh so that was me and then about that girl
she was um she was okay she she also failed
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back ha so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
and then
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there lah
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place eh I already down to gear two already even before that ah
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there ha my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that lah that's why he stood there
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
then after that uh she was trying to pick up the mood
no I was still on my bike
ha instructor instructor was there all the while ha so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
ha you concentrate or your bike ha you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall ah because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver lah maneuver the the turn but she
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
ha cause it's it's a bend what
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no lah I'm okay lah okay
then after that like
after that uh when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
uh the instructor tell me he said uh
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her kan he say you just go ahead first ah
ha prac one
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
when I got the results I was like
the fuck sial
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
no to me
really meh you use your foot brake what
really
huh
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
oh class two ten seconds slower ah
ha
but you but on on on gear one right
ya lah half clutch ya actually can what
is it
serious ah
ah
harly from this cafe racer you going to change to harly it's a big difference you know oh bobber bike kan that one ah the mutt the mutt the mutt but mutt is what country eh is it mutt ah
mm
confirm ah
ah
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred ah
ya lah that's why
bikes is it was it bikes there was one retailer there was one retailer that sells that bike
mm
huh who
oh
sanfu ah
paya lebar
for the mutt the mutt ah how much
excluding
machine price
oh inclusive a'ah
last year's was how much
ten thousand plus
ha
that bike is expensive ah
zontes cheaper ah
huh the mutt thing
zontes
ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening ha
sell out your bike first
mm
mm
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
mm mm mm
I think that you should consider that
there are many people who have class two bikes ah
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is ah on the roads ah that tells you how reliable the bike

sexual health
there's like sexual health plastic surgery you know personal finance take stock is a treasure trove if you know how to use it well
okay so the you know the um with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically um it's a K pop song by shinee
um ya so um so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny uh K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
it's I never heard I never heard
oh okay okay uh maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
I recently learn this term it's called um um
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like for example uh
what what's the oh ya ya ya ya I know it's so true oh my god
eh nasha
ah I mean like that number ah the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so um like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
um because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily uh loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main um
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like err an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on uh any
uh any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
ah tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated oh I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize eh you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once uh once it realizes that eh this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin to see you
oh wow
oh oh wow amazing wow
grab ge</mandarin knows you but you don't know his name

but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like um slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called saiki um
like exploded
strength ah yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also uh teleport um
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole anime
ya it's just him
the whole anime revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep uh people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole anime he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
um you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
um I don't know it's about twenty three plus
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like wow
right right I should have finished like one season
ya ya
oh ya ya ya ya
I'm starting there
ya you really have to get into it
oh
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a gundam series on kids central
oh
ya
mm mm
yes yes
yes
mmhmm
ya
okay okay
mm
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact gundam I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
mmhmm
oh okay okay
hmm
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into gundam and you're like no
gundam
ah it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now um
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet lah correct
um so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
ah no I think it's still with aisyah okay nevermind that's fine
ya so um
I I told her like eh sorry ah I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would um
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch um
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw ah I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya um it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze um there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends lah or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is err five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really um topics that you don't understand like uh explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because um
I like to read like I like tea you know to um
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their um comments is always oh this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad lah I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
oh ya so back to ah so um so I asked her like uh can you give like uh
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere lah and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
izz can easily catch up eh
ah okay lah not bad lah
oh yes
not bad
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
mm
ah
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
oh okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
oh my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
um this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with sha it was after A levels
um I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about uh this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
um came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian um
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this um spies
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
wow really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was um a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and uh so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like oh I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you um
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
uh huh like nudity or sexual references uh ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending oh it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
mm
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like oh okay wow
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it oh my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
ya alah
ah right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
um this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya wey or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with haikyu she was really into haikyu her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that um but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance uh series
when I was younger lah when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
a'ah
it really impacted the way um I saw how relationships or is
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
ya
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so uh so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like uh thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out um it was from this girl
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial um like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like oh my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have uh this kind of like
uh ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
uh fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like um
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
yes it is idiot
so okay so tup tup they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so uh he was looking for her
a'ah
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like um like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like oh my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay lah when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything um
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
ha it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean um the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
with uh starting mira filzah and if you know adi putra
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first mira filzah was twenty four seven
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult lah logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head ah ah
the instant ha instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid um commercial shampoo commercial

folding clothes
B one and B two
bananas in pyjamas
the mask lah
yes
ya I don't want to do
cause when I pass the mask they pass me back then I was like ugh K lah K lah K lah
I buy the materials already what
I need to make the template first cause
the template that I have in mind is
can be a little bit similar to their's that's why I rather not
K
then I just leave it empty orh until you come back to
then I throw them out
cannot my heart cannot
yes
if I have three wishes
the first wish to have more wishes
of course
second wish
is for you to shut up

why I am greedy
ya so I can have them wimp
K what what what what's your wish

to to make tour and stuff like that I'll rather do that sia
you know like tour kan usually at the they have scheduled shit
like
I can be like the one that makes the tour but not the tour guide get it that means I go there to
see see look look and enjoy myself first before
planning
I don't know
that's why I will be looking forward to go to work
then what you want to do
then that's gonna be boring
no then then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats
then you'll be looking forward for work everyday
you can make it a job

if your job is just that you you also would do it what like looking forward to it
if no money
if no money

nasi lemak
now you can foresee
fat

I thought I want to volunteer but then I think back
later I bring one home that but I got kick out of the house how then they stay inside with the with the people looking after them
ya
then I will feel
if I bring one home

people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
mm what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
ah
then like eh

hello
that's call cheat
ya
small kan
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
like while I was
bathing
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that kan
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that huh like the the motor and the and the cars are like
ya
ya
mmhmm
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet lah
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
mmhmm
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with irfan zahidah
once every
twice a month or something
huh
oh ah
like two to three months
ya
by who
blanks
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
yes
like it's quite
like hats off to them lah
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay kan
like
there's a castle in the
series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
it looks very
you know some some sets you know that it's a set kan
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
err
it's really
oh my god uh I cannot uh my brain is like fried it's really impressive lah
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big lah in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
mmhmm
mm
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
mm
mm
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts lah hor
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
eh buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
mmhmm
ya ya
makes sense food
ah aiya okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
so the reason why it's
and then
one for one specs lah like at at that point of time I was like thinking
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free lah for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so um
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
err
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was a heated argument eh discussion between me and my
like we were like
like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that lah but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
I don't know
and
it all
like
ya
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures pe ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
err
if you see ah the people who who buy glasses from owndays kan they also keep on changing their glasses
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
glasses um spectacle shops are following following it lah
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that kan usually ah specs
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try lah so that they can sanitise kan
and then
I was looking at like other customers ah and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know ah
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
mmhmm
a'ah ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also ah the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also lor I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
mm
ya
oh my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
oh ya talking about it
ya
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you sia I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like oh my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
like writing
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it lah ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype kan
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing lah like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like huh why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
mm
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual lah
and their self control I guess
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
huh
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised lah cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into lah to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
mm
uh huh
ya
ya
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting lah cause like
they keep on
giving you
different um
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing lah
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
mmhmm
wow
uh huh
maybe that's why you've been seeing jufri
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like
I have no idea
mmhmm
ya
also cause I go post
followed all your friends
ya
it's like if he if he cannot like get you he will try for your friends kind of thing you know
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
it's so weird
like a family member and like people know you
and then you start to like
dude
mm
mmhmm
uh huh
oh my god
mmhmm
oh my god
I guess it's his kink or something
like indonesian girls
ya
maybe they have like
an idea of like what
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
ee I hate guys like that
uh huh like
ah
mmhmm
ee
and and the thing is
each like
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
ah
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
mmhmm
like even if they don't have
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like
oh or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like oh you're too ya I don't deserve you you don't
I don't deserve you kind of thing then I'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
I shouldn't be like responsible for that lah ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
about himself
no lah I'm pretty sure you will find someone lah
maybe maybe not a muzmatch cause like I get it it's so hard to find
it's so hard to find guys who are like who are decent on the app like ya
ya
mmhmm
oh my god
ya
but that's that's so shallow though
okay I say I say that that's shallow right but I'm guilty of that also
like but but mine is in terms of height

maybe like
other girls

ah
I see
not really ah
so far was sam willows jer ah sam willows I I hear
and then after that
that's it lah
maybe err
sheikh haikel lah
maybe sheikh haikel music and maybe some
actually not really ah singapore band not singapore don't have
much
the malay group
ya
overseas the jam lah but those those err there's a few there's few groups those few groups that they did perform in singapore there is usually about one or two song but
not really that famous you know I have a few few friends that they they make
something along that line lah so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight lah
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job lah
so they are not that famous lah
but
err but ya lah I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
mmhmm
ya lah the
but it was mostly malay songs lah malay songs
mm ya lah she's more more of a
like theatre
like those you know voice not not really a band kind
ya
ah fazil
nuradi is it nuradi
mm
huh who
uh not too sure
talent train ah
mm
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay lah but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
err the jokes are more for singapore centric lah not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that eh maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
mm
mmhmm
ya lah I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya and then they no lah they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya lah but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months what
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
the talent show singapore idol
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh the voice ah sometimes like the voice lah
ya ah
ya
no lah the it's a draw what it's a draw
mm
ya lah I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again ah where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also what
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe tay is from my alma mater eh she was from yuan ching secondary
no she was way way way much my senior lah but
it's like the school very proud of her lah
yes of course
yuan ching
she wouldn't err declare
err she you know fanfare ah because yuan ching is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what ah then then she'll flaunt it
yuan ching
yuan ching ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
amin
but now COVID don't have already lah
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already lah
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no lah most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
eh ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression lah I mean
they they have to retire what once they they hit their sixties
have the energy lah
professorship
ya lah I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial ah
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch lah
ah
ah ah
even my brother is millennial
my brother naz
so naz is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation lah
no she she got uh she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot lah but
but if she can if she can you know err ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya lah but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation lah I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made err
make a profit lah but the thing is if she
ya lah about one point one million lah but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
mm
how much she bought it
but her one is at simei right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand uh
thirteen years ago
mm
oh
oh okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand lah
huh
so just just
uh amber road
ah
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal lah because err
oh so new lah
well that's a risk
development
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya lah
but her place second floor
what one point
oh
her main bedroom
oh cause so it's quite big lah
ya okay but
uh huh
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
dasha when she can save more money right
mmhmm
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person what
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
mm
mm ah
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more what if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored lah then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means err in the embassy one is paying for her living space eh if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay lah maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya lah but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury uh apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense what
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people lah
say about thousand plus ah ya maybe ah
okay
if six person ya lah if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya lah make sense lah
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy lah one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy err is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya lah I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo lah so that
they are being sheltered lah
fixed condo
ah
ah
ya lah ya lah
mm mm ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they uh being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but err when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference ah cause
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes err what drives what drives people
mm
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
err flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
mmhmm
how much
ya that's quite a lot
oh eh so he's the degree lah
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
uh huh
oh okay
mmhmm
okay
uh huh
eton what's a eton
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore lah
oh
depend on the area lah depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese leh
he's err he knows err he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese err they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area lah maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence ah
mm
huh russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
uh huh
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
oh malaysian malaysia hospital lah
oh okay and then then okay lah
ah
oh why ah
wasted kan
medicine also medicine what
oh
oh okay
eh oh err rundy rundy
rundy rundy
uh ireland or scotland ah
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand ah
four hundred thousand
mm
ya
mm
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait ah can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
mm
I think the highest I heard is jer lah
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback ah
uh
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge ah
uh huh
ah ah
uh huh
I think ya lah because the the guys are not
no no the the
err secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
ah because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which ah no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences ah
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan
cairo
al-azhar lah
then
mmhmm
oh really
okay then
okay
how come it's like that ah
okay then how about
oh
if it's not recognize then because she she don't want to take
and then the the mother wants her to take right
but now after COVID after COVID she
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya that's actually quite
quite sad lah
cause the amount because there's some
ya I mean that's quite
unfair lah but
the amount of effort and they put
but in the end err she should've finish already right
uh why no good
egyptian arab spring arab
ya lah I mean
mm but
it's kind of sad lah that that wani that control all those things and then
let's say if if she's not recognise cannot get a good salary job then it's also quite
quite a pity lah but luckily the sister did land with parkway east which is quite good lah that you know
huh really

yup you don't apply in real life situation
that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system
nothing has changed eh over the past how many years we've been living in singapore it is still the same concept of education and everything
it's like you know like the survival of the fittest lah
ya ya he say err work hard or work in mcdonald's
understood understood understood
ah
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay err honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's ah we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly um
K initially err this is like my third err application to you know ah sorry should I should not mention the name lah
um
almost to like a nine K eh err nine K of err school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
when it comes to studies wise err
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
but I I had a very long months of preparing but but because of err I was like I don't know it's I just I just got so complacent in my head
ah
so and then I saw in err semester three I told myself no I cannot
and then my my results was alhamdulillah I mean I I was quite surprised ah that I got three point nine which is the highest I have ever gotten lah
and then err I remember sitting with this err with this lady lah she is err from penang you know she no no I I I went penang sorry ya I went penang and then I was on my way back from penang to singapore via flight so there was this err lady that I I sat beside and then err
when I because I was sitting at the window seat right so when I say err excuse me err then err then so when I enter err and sit and when I seated here now
you know she automatically she ask me eh you singaporean ah
ya you can tell ah you can tell from a from a
yes it's it's different and then um then she was asking she was telling me lah
err every everyone is kind of like taken care of lah I would say I mean I do not know I mean I I I've been staying there for like almost err three three three years plus now err it's good ya it and err I find that
I want to stay in malaysia or not I tell you
provided I'm earning a lot in singapore then I will stay in malaysia
understood
yes yes yes yes
yes it doesn't make sense for me
ah understood
and they they even say it like my malaysian even say my malaysian friends lah even say like is a expensive city to live in
like if you go other city or other states is much more cheaper when it comes to the items and everything so you got me thinking lah oh
ya
understood understood understood
but at but we never have anything to begin with
or also known as tanned
err he ask me eh you go kedah
ah
I mean err I did visit my friend lah in kedah lah in one way or another lah but this that that part
the almighty you know in the other life
but
but I always tell him lah like eh you cannot you know so back to my err double life so ya lah I mean at the err
and then
I am planning to do my internship in singapore because at the end of the day I'm going to come back and and work here
yup
understood
yup yup
err whether I want to go into teaching whether I want to go into academics or whether I want to go into err media I still haven't decide lah I mean
so I will say lah in the next err one and a half years start starting from october

wish eh
then for you
three months
oh like how is it
twice a week
ah not bad lah
oh you met the the mum
okay
ya lah
uh
mm
eh
right
oh okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you ah
but you guys haven't fought right okay lah
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
oh
I think it will take a while lah
one year
K lah
um I think one year okay maybe six months ah
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
mm
mm so
mm
mm
mm
oh
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
mm
mm mm
mm
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
mm
ya I mean take a risk ah if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
kan I mean that's what I would do lah
then um okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of ah
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly lah what kind of course he wants cause like
mm
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
oh okay okay
there's a master's in uh lasalle
uh err east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay lah like
cause if you just study jer kan
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy ah
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
mm
mm mm mm
okay two years ah
when
ya
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that lah I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your um
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet ah
but for you
mm
uh
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive kan then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare ah
oh
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
tuas tuas
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
PayNow uh uh seh
clubhouse
okay
oh okay but it such a weird place lah to like get a get married at uh at tuas
ya I mean if you're up for pulau tekong kan
like I'm if you're if you're up for pulau tekong you're up for pretty much anywhere seh but I think you don't want sentosa right sentosa is too touristy for me
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
oh ya you just book the cruise lah you just get one cruise uh uh
then you get married in the on the water
uh
uh uh seh
like like go all out lah
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
uh mocktail lah mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
uh huh
oh nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
oh okay okay okay
mm
ya I know
okay so like what do you guys get
uh uh
brunch menu mm
mm
okay lah best lah
mm
mm
mm
then you barbecue yourself or what
oh K
oh K K ya lah like buffet lah then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
mm ya ya ya
eh but no barbecue pineapple is nice
oh
oh because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly lah I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
aww it tasted like meat ya
mm
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was um
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first one
um
ah seh or you can go with us lah like me and uh me and hafiz so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also lah then at least there's some a bit of
mm
mm
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay lah so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that lah obviously
really ah
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
err show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
mm
mm
uh
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover seh
like even
if they they recover like if johor is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
mm
mm
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
uh uh
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it lah
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck ah ah cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
mm
ya
ya
uh uh
ya ya ya
mm
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad ah
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
ah luck luckily like mm I alighted much like err quite fast lah so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
uh
uh huh
ya
ya
mm
ya
uh
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit uh
uh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay
uh
okay
uh
uh and just be aunties lah
ya ya ya ya
mm mm
uh uh seh
uh uh
ya
mm
ah ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like oh my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to ah ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
mm
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm how how their conditions were right
oh my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
uh
uh
uh
mm
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb jer ah cause no choice kan ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order ah law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then err some people made a a like sarcastic kind of err remark it's like err go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this one they say go to hospital because they found out like
uh
uh
that time ah
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like err you you don't you can't transmit anything lah so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work seh
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more leh then I'm like oh my goodness
uh
this kind of like way to combat right uh uh it's like I read it I cannot forget seh then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous

okay we can start talking now ah so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
oh ya ya
I don't think it was part of the rediscover thing I don't know the whole list isn't out yet right
a condo snow city I can ask any of my ex colleague for your hair that you can go you for freely given got the shooting shooting why the laser tech tuition right
that one got the shooting shooting one paintball thingy ya
coming to december kan
is it haunted
no because like a few days ago I was watching some story
oh
just to be safe ah
job finding not so good lah still finding hundred plus going to two hundred jobs already rejected funny thing even temporary job also they don't want what to do
then
ya my career futures is a lot of
mendaki have opening but that time they wanted someone with a degree of sociology
ya
it's good full time already now
true lah but okay lah
but it's okay lah crowne plaza now got staycation package mah next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook mah mama can cook
but she eat ramen all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree
really okay I should try
oh K K K ya
sure can lah you know why not
that's a good idea write in lah write in to lee hsien loong ah
they got power mah he can phone call to the maldives government what
ya it's not mine also
mm okay
is it kenya
safari kenya tanzania lah
I think it's tanzania because of serengeti national park so that's tanzania but also can what because you just travel south kenya on top tanzania below mah I think I can take qatar then I will fly to qatar and then go down
there got flight
good lah I don't have qatar membership
leverage on your brother

so ya
oh ya my last
you know my err last duty
eh no three shocks then the pulse came back

then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much lah but most of the time we still try ah just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare ah unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing lah
to do that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay what actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already

I don't know if I got tell you before like I keep forgetting I think I told I told #Wati#</P2 or some shit but like me me and this girl right we met in um

ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
the in Tampines
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
oh um this girl her name is #Aisyah#</P2 #Aisyah#</P2
Aisyah#</P2>'s mum is actually
my mum's friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like

ya so like me and #Aisyah#</P2 we like
grow up together lah like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so I was like primary two primary three

then after that like me and so
so halfway through
uh you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small #Kahir#</P2 inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
yeah
like shoulders then I ask you understand malay meh then he said

oh my god I always wanted to see
ha okay K K
ya
ya
oh okay lah and
oh
cause other dating apps you need to upload a legit photo of yourself right to make sure that
ah I've been wanting to see how it works
oh is that
oh
ha
you cannot like delete the profile ah
serious then what did the guy do
the thing right then they will read it was the limit of ten guys I think oh
oh
okay okay
ya that's why it's like a bit too intense for me lah
Muzmatch
uh
mm
oh
cool through half of our deen
ya
ya
oh
oh
oh my god that's nice okay set I will go for half of our deen instead of Muzmatch
ya international love that's the way to go
but half of our deen also for muslim
oh
serious
Muzmatch no need to pay
oh
interesting
where were where is it from I heard it's from some dating apps also was it I'm not sure
so that they will match you to the right person like
I don't know what is it
do you pray oh okay
ya
oh
okay okay that's cool
interesting
but do you think you will bond to meet your significant other through a dating apps
I think
oh
ya
that's true
I know right
I like to observe the people first from afar
then see how is he like then I did like something that
um people other people opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instant if people around him keep saying that oh my god he is such a nice person and he does this this this then I will
be like oh okay since like he is kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya or else
ya that's true
oh
ya
that is so sad
ya
hmm
that is sad
oh well sometimes it works for people sometimes it does not
about putting themselves out there you know some people were saying that in unique
a lot of people also try their best to put themselves out there and you can see there's some people will be turned off by that right
ah that is true that is true
ya
ya ya it does
clap for me
ya ya that is scary
ya
I don't know whether it is still like that is it still like that
or maybe I just turn a blind eye on it it just like
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor lah somethings like trekking oh my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like um sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
ha
tricky question don't know eh I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
oh ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
oh okay okay sure
few months okay
oh ya then the first one eh
oh my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
ah
kan like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
wah
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen lah
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
oh that is super rude though
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
mm
oh okay okay
ya
oh
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
oh okay
uh huh
ya
oh okay that's so fast but that's so cute too lah
interesting
oh
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
oh
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
ah
oh
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
I don't know lah you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
mm
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
oh I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine lah
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya oh my god
twenty five sounds like a good age
then now you're twenty two you haven't really get your shit together then like
three years to get your shit that's really too fast
ya I think like twenty five sounds okay if you already have a
ya
a'ah a'ah my friends also
at first I was like ah I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like ah but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems a'ah and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
obstacles challenges you will go stronger lah and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life

okay can start already
good I'm good

before COVID kan
that was like
many many months seh
ya
so
err how have you been like I mean how's your work been
ah
so like err were you affected
I see
so like are you working from home now or what
mm
like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring lah
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like alah online jer pe
ya
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
like
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya lah but now um it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
ah ya lah ya lah I mean
I'm trying
ya true
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
mm liho
kan
eh but I've been doing this err one cardio tau
err this one channel
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
so
then um
video
oh no I think
songs you know music so
to me
quite quite quite quite fun also
ah ah
because for me like
be consistent ah
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ah ya
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
um
okay lah maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
the orangey type or the white one
you you still use it lah
oh
we met in err
primary school ah
wait
wait
so if we met serious primary three
oh my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
oh my
eh but actually kan
but actually
our friendship is like random
kan because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other kan
close
yes then
wow you know I'm an introvert kan then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
ya
oh my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay lah okay lah let's not go that direction
oh about my boyfriend eh
okay lah okay ah I think
mm
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay err what was the last time that I told you about him eh do you remember
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
err eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because kan he um because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
kan so like um
his condition kind of worsen tau
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him lah got worse
he
something wrong err there's something wrong with his kidney
so
for the for the for the appointment
ya but then
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
throughout this whole um
so like
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
mm ya
ya because
like
mm okay
okay actually kan that time he asked me tau
okay
okay this is very cliche but
like
like like like you said relationship
but
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know eh because you know my soft spot for my ex kan
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to err my friend
that guy
ah like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my my mood
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
kan
actually kan to think of it I think he was like my only best friend tau
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit seh double blow ah in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
um like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay lah I was a shitty person
then
ah
we bump into each other and then
keep like letters
pictures
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I basically I tried to flirt with him tau
no
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
err it was a not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
oh wait no or was it a date
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
I think so lah I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
then
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
err what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said um
because that's me as a person that's my personality
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again lah
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me um
traumatised
seriously
he's just so
ya
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious seh I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day
I asked him out for a catch up session
a'ah seh recently I've been dreaming about him that's why I asked you this question
then um
ya
maybe
maybe his birthday is in january tau
ya
do you have any plans
ya
okay
kan kan
true
with someone shitty like me just kidding
okay
ya
ya lah ya lah
you can like do many many recordings for them
ya but
ya but I think for now
ya man tell me about it
next ah next
well I can write like a whole twelve series about you
you and your you and your don't don't get me started on your
your nonsense

ya at this rate honestly I'm just grateful if we can travel to malaysia even johor bahru will be good enough
for me since um as you know right I have a house in and it's been
eight months I think
since I last went back and
um when back and you know met my see my cats and just do weekend grocery shopping
ya so it's
when uh when was last time you travelled
they are locals they are local students
all all these
all these you're talking about your trip ah in korea to korea
mmhmm
mm
okay for me I went to korea as well the last time
it was
last
mm
no
so I was there uh I went with my friend on a night
um
so
we had a actually quite
the flight experience was
okay for me this one my first night flight
but
cause
this time round was with Korean Air
so I didn't really I didn't really enjoy my flight lah
ah
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm
okay we didn't want to spend too much lah on
flight
cause when we were when we're going to be in korea for eleven days
so
it's more of like what we gonna spend over there
not so much of the flight
so
so what did I
hotel
Airbnb
ya
okay
I tell you my journey lah kan
so we were very happy that it's convenient
very excited
not to the lobby lah
so we we put uh we key in the pin code and then we saw flight of stairs
are you kidding me I'm not uh I
I'm I don't I don't want what
what what I I don't want to
bring my luggage up lah you know
it was it was like err
but we had no choice we had to do lah
key in key
the first thing we saw was a puppy it was a dead uh it was it was a puppy it was a toy
and send and send to the owner
it was a doll
mm
you get what I mean or not
dhira do you know what I mean or not
ya
so it's actually a toy it's actually a
what do you call that
uh not not really not not statue lah it's like
what ah um
no no no no no
ya it's more of a decoration piece just to add in to the apartment
ya
so we actually okay
so what we did was we actually booked one night
so instead of booking ten nights we actually booked eleven nights
just so that we don't have to wait until the
the check in time at three
so that's what we did lah
how how ya
mm
mm mm
mm
check in
mm
mm
ya so
we in order for us to move in
we had to book one night at the okay one night before so that
the nobody can book and then we can have that room like so technically it's like
we check in late lah right
we check in late but we just paid we paid the extra
one twelve forty dollars
cause it's forty dollars per forty five dollars per night
mm
I stayed at dongdaemun
ya
mm
for me um
during my time eleven days there lah right uh what
makes it um okay cause I went there for trip so it was just me and my friend
just the two of us
err initially we wanted to go
to the other part of korea like daegu and busan
but we decided to um decided not to lah
so we just stayed for
mm we didn't okay wait we didn't really okay now I'm with I'm trying to recall I think out of the eleven days only the first seven days we actually did quite a lot of things the other four days is just like lazing around lazing around uh and
more like own time own target
when we feel like going out we go out if not then we just
eat Maggi in the in the room
cause we just want to get the korea air
mm
planetarium
mm so it wasn't a skiing period lah
it was like spring I think
ya it's spring
ya it's spring
the only thing that okay
it was crowded
so our main objective um
was to go around to all the hot spots
to take photos um
and just chill
like their people that like their locals
so we went to so we went to hongdae myeong-dong all those typical place lah
mm
no that was my graduation trip so before before before I went korea okay okay I okay to be honest right last last year
last year was
um the best I think was the best like
one of the best year of my life like one of the best year
march I was in I went to japan for a family trip with my uh for family trip so I only came back for one week
before I travelled to korea with my friend for for trip
so I actually went so actually went to japan and korea
uh one for family trip and then one for
err
one for um trip with my friend
um
mmhmm
okay for me um cause I just started cause I just started the good thing is that um
I went to okay I
how do I say this
okay I enrolled in I enrol in together with my friend who I went for trip to korea last year
so technically we will graduate we will graduate at the same time
at the same time
so ya maybe if
so maybe if we have we do not we don't have more we don't have
much commitment uh I wouldn't mind planning for a trip with her
but honestly I feel like going to switzerland
but it's so expensive lah aiyo
for me it's actually the scenery
not much so much of
cause when I travel I don't I don't like to shop actually
ya
okay and to be honest I don't mind going back to korea even though okay I've been to korea
the experience uh were all different so I went
the third time was with my friend so these three actually gave me a different these three actually gave me a different experience but out of these three actually the last experience
very bad like very very bad experience okay the thing is right maybe cause
my friend and I
we look like koreans
so we were like treated like locals like people were like rude to us
ya
um
travel to krabi in june
so we supposed to travel in june cause
I was supposed okay I was supposed not I was supposed lah
like freedom to travel so we planned for like a five
five five days four nights to krabi so we had all like we create a WhatsApp group of all the cousins going blah blah blah blah blah
and then got cancelled
cause of COVID
so
even though I entitled for eighteen days leave I end up using my leave
for exams
uh yes
uh for the first time it's actually unlimited
is still part of singapore
is it part of singapore so you need to take ferry lah aiyo need to take a ferry that that's what makes it different lah but let
oh okay speaking of pulau ubin uh recently actually okay we had we had uh group uh like
all the cousins right
we have group with all the cousins right
it's a legit group
I didn't enrol in that camp but sister did lah
my my sister did
so but none of my cousins okay the cousins that were supposed to go krabi all of us have never been to pulau ubin so we wanted to go to pulau ubin
like last
like
last month
so we cancelled that
so to be honest the group the WhatsApp group name keep changing
no
I'm sleeping I'm sleeping alone
shut up
loyang still exist ah
I can't remember the last time I actually went to chalet
civil defence or civil servant
orh
mm
okay no wait now you're talking about horror story
okay ah just nice before COVID the same group of cousins who actually planned for krabi
okay okay how this group started kan
it's was cause we we
we planned for all
okay I have a very big family so the girls that are not married
female like the close one that are not married yet
uh five of us
okay so
uh five of us lah
so in
so there were five of us
my sister me my three of my cousins lah so we planned and then we stayed in a hotel a quite famous hotel
so we okay so they were insist they insisted
to
take bus
I don't want to take bus
I I hate long bus ride
I prefer honestly I prefer like uh
bus
more expensive one type more expensive ones so it was quite comfortable ya so it was quite comfortable
so that's not the point the point was
we reached the hotel at five
five and all of us are like half awake
so reached the hotel lobby and then we checked in as usual cause we did ask we did request for early check in cause one thing about our there's one thing about me and my family we don't like to waste time
we don't like to wait we we just would rather just pay extra to just like check in early whatever lah
so reached the hotel the hotel lobby
um
uh one one one one of the one of the famous hotel in that has a shopping mall
so
cause there were five of us so we take the suite
the okay that that was not the first time uh I stayed there
it was the second time actually the first time was with my family lah
so it's technically a a door like
door within a door you get what I mean
okay on the okay so on the next next okay the door next to our room
is the emergency exit
so when you walk a little bit more uh it's the kitchen the big living room with the dining
with dining
inside that living room next to the dining is another room with a king-sized bed that that that that's my cousin's room
so we have two toilets lah
okay the thing is that right when you when we went in uh cause we were all very sleepy already
so we just take our spot we didn't even bother to like
err
give any comments we only shared our experiences when we reached singapore and it's not like the next day after one week and we actually heard it from
our mothers like like I told my mum
ah they told their they told their my aunt
so actually my mum and my aunt shared our stories then we we went back to the WhatsApp group and like
oh my god you experience you experience this
I experience this also
then after that we meet and then we shared the story like it's funny that
all of us experienced different things but we only decided to share that thing when we in singapore
okay so
my there there were five of us so
uh my sister and I took the first room
so my cousin insisted that she wants an extra bed
so we so we called and all these we we called and then they said that uh oh um the bed is hundred fifty per night and all this lah
ya but
so so we were like okay lah we didn't think much then like just heard the biggest the bigger sister took the sofa and then we all just went to bed and then at twelve and then at twelve and then at twelve when we wanted to go for lunch
then my cousin brought it up again I want to get an extra bed
so everybody sleep in the room together
ya the same cousin that okay one of the younger one lah
so she she insisted she wanted to get extra bed
so we were like why why is she so persistent then my my sister my sister my sister offered
uh no okay wait no babe the story has not ended
so uh when my sister offered
she she was still very persistent my cousin was still very persistent no no no no everybody sleep in the room
so
at night we all went back
and then we we all went back and then
we all went back to our hotel room and then suddenly we just
together
so we actually brought the entire uh we moved the entire bed uh all the mattress outside at living room imagine how big the living room is
so we moved everything out at the living room and then we just slept together for three nights
okay let's just sleep together
okay
so
we thought of like uh let let's go get bath bombs
uh
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
no
um
after that is the bathtub
um the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too lah so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money lah I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
uh that okay that was the second night when we decided to um buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and uh my grandma
yes
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
ah
but
we didn't think much lah cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me um what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something lah
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
um
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say um
ya
when my mum called her sister then
mmhmm
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
uh another bed
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
um this this kind of thing ah ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
um she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually uh on the left
um
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
um dusty
nothing else um was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall one the room was dusty lah
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think uh occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
um in our heart lah we're like
uh this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause uh it was like five thirty in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed ah
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins uh she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins ah
so my cousin said uh
best lah
uh it was fun
but we had uh
we had experiences
uh in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
oh
yes
so they did that um
so so the moment she know what that she uh quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google lah
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
uh
the first time
was with my family
but that one we actually uh my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room ah during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just uh king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the uh
front room lah
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
oh only sixteen twenty
that uh definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel seh
corner corner
okay the the floor
so the the the hotel very big right
uh the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
uh
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like um kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
uh we couldn't be bothered lah cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
uh
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work ah we we we like err don't want ah we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to krabi if not cause of this COVID
ah it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us uh
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were uh
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think lah
eh ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal one
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
err given a choice I won't want to go back there
ah
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins
cause if I'm if I'm cannot experience it with my family my my mum who knows my mum will end up reading one one whole book of like
ah recite recital and
the laundry room
no while waiting for laundry
ya I remember that story

oh because it's much easier ah
mm
so so you it really depends uh ah
ah
mm
oh
mm
a'ah
which one is this eh
mineral water jer eh

human that
so like you don't even need to think about like the basically no stress at all lah
mm
mm

marching what's the point sia ya
huh

so he's the construction manager for MINDEF lah
like oh I got no feeling liao no work no work also everyday I will come to work lor
ah
oh
ya ya ya ya it's true ah
huh
mm
oh ya ah
huh
a'ah
ah
not not many not many of the bangladesh or or the workers ah are actually
then you do what sweep the floor ah what else you want me to do sia
ah
ah
ah
oh
mmhmm
a'ah seh
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
oh okay
is
oh ya ya

my side recording
five four three two one
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these leh I don't think this err all the researchers I think it's okay lah to all these to talk about all these things ah I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
a'ah
mm
mm
mm
uh uh god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks err assuming one game a week lah
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per ah for the whole tournament kan then we take just ten percent that's uh between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour lah outside lah now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out lah but whatever it is at least eh the whole tournament um one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
uh I drop it in discord
ya so
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
um I just didn't know
you know the this league not worth it seriously
ah
ah
en
mm
ya
ah
mm
mm
a'ah
a'ah
ah ah
mm
mmhmm
ah exactly exactly ya
mm
ah
ah
mm
mm
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point lah is that social media aspect lah so
but um the social media aspect of a one off thing eh
err
ah ya
ya
ah
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and ah we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio eh how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not ah
mm mm
hmm hmm hmm maybe maybe who knows maybe
mm
mm mm
mm
I
ah okay all the tournaments then
you know so
ya so
mm
mmhmm
mm
err five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know err so err or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that ah we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool eh wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off tau this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
mm
mm
ya correct
uh huh
ya okay
uh huh
ya
mm
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say eh we do everything for every
let's say every saturday lah eh every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get err thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have um four four prize winners
each of the prize winners err okay and then at least err total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright um
or we could just put it every every week err the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number lah K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
okay a'ah and then like this ah we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool lah basically lah alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say eh thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
ya
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that lah so let me get up my word pad my notepad ah so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
oh six eight
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually ah we can't do that maybe top eight ah top eight get five percent lah
yes
ah
ya get a wise five uh eh
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
uh huh
a'ah
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent ah
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great lah okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
K
um
ya
eh of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is lah whatever amount
there will really get people to like eh siala if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at eh I only pay five dollar registration fee tau I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
a'ah correct
so that's it we need to have at least
um
um
okay but that's why okay you um then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
mm mm
mm true also true also difficult ah
mm
sixty four possible
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
en
mm
so this idea eh is basically if I were to go to N
en
err but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them kan they're all out for it
his words lah
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
let me
ah
let me try and see if I can find err
err what's that called lah
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
err basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations ah
it's a it's a carbon copy
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then err this err will have err the our
what I'm afraid of eh is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about lah like
err like um even when I I told her the idea look ah why not err we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these tau she want us to be on our own
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event tau
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african lah
that's the number one thing ah
yes
ah
ah
mm
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor lah
a
ah
ah
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible um you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all lah you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
err potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
um
ya ya correct
a
uh huh
a
you will have your own you know shout out lah you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising ah a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events eh is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they err how to say that the
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer lah in a way lah
it's the same as advertisement ah so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
mm but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head eh I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay err so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us lah okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
mm
yup mm mm mm
so
ha ha
a'ah sia
alamak
alamak
okay
okay
ya
okay
um
there's another
ah correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports lah
one play E sports
pure err pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
mm
ya the singapore premier league a week ago err three point eight K views
mm
err what's that called
okay E singa cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
err E singa cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs ah
for the one V one E singa cup
one V one E singa cup
oh they split it into
the whole league
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands ah early thousands
you know so ya
oh shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
ah
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel err you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
ya that would that would really help
because eh if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just err aiman giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then err what's that called ah ya and then like this ah people will be alerted
ya
exactly
ah correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because ah I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
ah
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
a
ya
um
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
you know and all we want eh it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
or whatever we can uh we can get lah we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
ah ya so
mm
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who sekaiichi is ah they just look at pure viewership numbers ah we can talk about them eh we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
ah
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because um and you know really likes to work together with me lah basically lah
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA lah so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there lah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm ah
okay so
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
who do they have

yes
what was just now your meet up

I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset what like last time also holiday is like finish up the
um
assessment book that kind but the thing is right um
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like um
uh
oh like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like hey I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like huh maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
okay okay and uh
that's usual lah cause ilan was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you what
timetable kan
like like she can even ask me like when I said
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
eh err one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me err is it err minus or plus
ya ya ya that kind of thing
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff lah
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her ah
is like
ya lah the one he didn't show us right so anyway when I read I read that
he
I felt that he wrote it slightly differently lah formally but
to me
I don't know maybe malay the standard is not high so
he keeps missing out punctuation marks
frankly speaking now that you ask me I don't even remember the english but I remember the malay
he just
punctuation marks I don't know why
I feel like he should there should be a writing camp you know like drill them to writing and then like learn a lesson
okay

no plans to move what do they expect to
then the only way is to rent lah
because they cannot you cannot buy in time what it's gonna be end of the year
I don't know man
ya did he mention like
ya another two more minutes
fast
ya please please and
ilya first
just now when did err why did uh your friend calling me
mm
confidential stuff
confidential stuff
mm

it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say ah
how's your day
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday kan she I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
oh miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already what what's happening
yesterday right
then cheng san was like oh I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three
and ming gee that's six people okay
and she's like oh some of them say they are open to it
um and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say oh they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group lah if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it oh so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her lah and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else ah like
you got your own issues then
ugh okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do thing
sub for school
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time ah
then now she go
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny ah
oh she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
eh
do not off
mm
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim boon lay kan
man it's just generally quiet lah also
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was syaza's syaza's shoot
but syaza's shoot jingle was there
serangoon but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
ow
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion wow
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
ah I don't know lah it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one uh huh
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say ah
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday lah in school so ya
ah ya
once every twice a month
okay lah
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
eh but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
and I'm like
mm I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
but it was quite cool lah
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel del luna
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from right
mm
this malay boy and he graduated and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool lah
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like huh
maybe I should do that duh I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like ho
ya
but
it was an option ah
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
mmhmm
oh okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first eh one for one eh
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent kan to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
huh
are you sure are you sure
but only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation kan a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like oh you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty ah
I have nothing to say about that ah
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility kan
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not kan
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
migrant workers and community cases like as if
like it's the same thing both is humans
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
obviously with everybody what with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
aiya it's so
shady
but we know that lah
but
but just what like
mm but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to thinking like wah I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad lah like
we we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
mm just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere aiya it's just
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
oh okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like oh I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
I don't know lah
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
mm
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
but we have no firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
yay we love grey areas
aiya and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
you know
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
because this is
islamic law kan but it's not like
until the scholars were like hmm
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like hmm we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
then it's like hmm you know
culture changes also so it's like ugh
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change ah but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
and not
whether
thoughts of this so deep
moved a circle
really ah shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
eh I spend a lot of my day talking err like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes err sometimes I never notice then oh marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
oh all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you what all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them lah and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
mm
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
wah I don't know man
are you saying me and jufri have the same face
attractiveness level
eww
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like err so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app kan I I
at first I put my name
kan like my whole name I'm nabilah
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private lah and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like whoa people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
ee that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
ugh
oo I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already lah to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable lah because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
ee and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly lah actually he's worse than jufri
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
like
are you okay
you know and then
uh but his
he's weird lah
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny lah ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child lah
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
but it was like damn disgusting
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like eww like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
eww no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the ah the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
oh my god
like
I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
it is funny ah
mm
I think he
he's crazy ah
oh my god that's that's like the the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
mm
it should swing that way
but I like male male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like oh
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
oh my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I ah ya
it's like I get it lah okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like oh I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like oh
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
mm
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know ugh
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
mm uh you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
aiya and you feel shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
that is just not my style
aiya my worst match just for ego boost lah lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life mm
it's quite funny ah
there was a guy who asked what what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell lah then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
err
I don't know I think I will still talk to you oh you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
ah that's quite funny
I mean
mm
actually I'm the same lah
but I short lady ah so good for me
mm
I'd feel iffy about it lah but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm eh I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like huh
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket lah bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so aduh it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
aiya
I lazy ah
ya
higher angle eh
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
oh
that's my only photo that I use for until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad ugh
ya
I have so many selfies
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid lah
okay lah at least I rent a smart eight one lah
but he's damn tall sial
he's damn tall to me lah
you talk about him I'm like oh
ah
ya
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then I'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay lah he sees you like that what and he still like you so
that's all right right hmm
you you you know it's it's legit
I don't know I never checked she's like sorry it's a bad timing I know I think it's about me
I'm like aiya

I'm fine thank you
how's your family
ah
ya second one is a boy right
oh I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
oh
uh I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it um you might know them because some of them are our former ah schoolmates
oh you're into baking now wah that's nice wah must try some of your cake soon ah
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
ah movie but ah during this pandemic kind of hard lah because I think with the crowd control and all
wah netflix and chill ah
err I don't know uh only so far only a few have confirmed but uh
I will update you ah on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can lah uh
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
ah
um but is it too young for them to start
um going to tuition at this age she's only six years old kan
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that err everyone is competing uh so
it's
it has its pros and cons ah like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
ya but
slowly lah but surely uh I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important lah they just try their best lah
and
I I do have other maybe uh I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
oh oh
orh okay okay I understand I can ask for you lah then
err we'll see what we can arrange
err
wah you sit down at coffeeshop ah I thought you atas one
oh you you full time housewife ah
good lah
actually it's better for to me lah personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
um like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore err I think err
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive ah then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day uh some owners also like abuse their maid lah so that's not right lah I feel
ya there's uh the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse ah think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news lah but you just have to be updated lah now with the
COVID nineteen ah I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that lah before they are cleared to do cleaning oh mm
oh must take care of your health now lah
like but I think if now if you go to any
uh I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya lah for those who are working lah they will give you like
to check on yourself
err so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ah
uh alhamdulilah so far
I'm okay lah maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest uh because of work ah
um politic lah then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what uh
safety measure measurement at work mm cause yes
now currently we have this installation uh of doraemon at the national museum it's interesting lah but
unless I'm there lah then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ah
uh
uh claim it
oh usually you go to johor ah and do your shopping
I think so far our government has done well lah to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
mm
oh
ah so it's like
uh they have different sizes lah and
uh they cater also for kids
mm
mm
ya true
ya
ya but surprisingly
I think they are currently
preparing ah for phase three to roll out but ya lah depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert lah it's important lah for us to be on alert
ah foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
mm
ya lah
mm
you know
stay home notice ya
and I think uh for those who are coming in I think
uh they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure ah I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required lah eh even when they come in they have to do the swab test lah
ah
ya thankfully
a
mm yes yes
uh I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the uh the conduct the test
was mm asked to leave I think he got a job as a security lah err and considered is also a high risk because err he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm uh
but actually they're paying quite
high lah is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that lah because they don't want to
be in contact ah ya don't want to be exposed to this uh and even when he he's finished his job think he ask uh his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can uh remove his clothes outside his house uh ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace lah so it's just an
additional steps ah precaution ya
ah
ya you see
ah so it's not easy ah it's quite
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
a few cartons eh I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe lah
got some quality is not that good ah
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask ah
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but
no lah I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last lah err for a few months then but you have to
wash lah I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse lah
mm
err according to the
safety measurement I think
mm
ya can okay lah that's an idea but
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
mm
ah three kan mm
mmhmm
mm
feels also quite sad lah for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something ah but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad lah but it's better than not having no job and all lah ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya lah
ya lah it's tiring lah even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now uh doing grab but grab is also affected err think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he uh took back the car ya but still it's not doing well lah he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental uh
to the family lah
mm true lah I think
the government implementing a lot of err help for those
need them ah they also I think they have set up this um united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need lah ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march ah I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya lah things will get better lah think I think for singaporean ah they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases ah that can affect us
prata
uh there's a prata at sin ming I think it's quite nice it's run by a family uh father and a son
can can um
can ah maybe I want to try eat the briyani ah
the briyani is quite nice ah I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best ah
err what do you want to order I help you order
the briyani or the prata coin is also nice
and it's
I think just the right
taste ah
can
uh I think I eat briyani with uh fried chicken lah mm because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking ah
then what drinks do you want
teh peng teh peng
teh with ice eh
ya but I think is not that good to always drink teh with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better lah at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health err and also see what eat we eat
ah and also see what we eat
okay
can
uh
anything else
wah there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
digital
uh you order lah since you are very good using app
um briyani chicken
ya fried chicken
mm
ah yes
oh so we have to pick up or
oh okay oh that's
ya I understand but err I volunteered with err an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food err to buy groceries so that they will minimize err their movement outside ah so they can actually err contact us and have like medication
uh you can buy for them and then send it to their homes um
ya lah I think it's a long way to help our seniors uh
because I think if they are exposed to this I think um probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is uh I think done by government agencies ah they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors uh so that they will not be exposed much ah so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies ah then we will be there to send groceries medication uh food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer lah through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask eh for more information lah ya
um
free ah
mm
ya
communication
is
mm
mm
ya lah
data
mm
oh the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort ah to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal ah
mmhmm
ya lah
mm
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide lah
ah
the social distancing ah
mm
mm
ah social distancing ambassador
mm
ah

so the first day um afro was like in the corner
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me

oh but then again cause I'm not keeping up with the new ones
what is it about
okay okay
okay
ya that genre is is I mean that's my favourite genre which is shonan
ya
okay
okay
ah
explode
a'ah ah
okay strength
okay
oh okay wow
I thought I thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
mm
huh then how does he talk
ha so he just hears his voice in other people's heads
so people think he's stupid
oh my god
okay okay okay
you watch two episodes
three episodes how do you watch three episodes
right oh you skip you skip the
you don't you skip the intro and ending right
huh serious ah
how many episode is it
oh you mean like each season got twenty something episodes chey
no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite gundam series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
mm
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy lah like
like you know brings us together
that's rude
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
hmm
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
ya
although it did start lah it did spur it it started my my thing for gundam so okay fine fine I give you that bandai
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay lah fun
hmm
ya
yes so how did it go
hmm
she's like tall she's so tall
hmm
right right
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
oops
huh
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore oh okay she knows eh
wow
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
mm
mm
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
oh ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
mm
ya ya ya
okay
oh ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments lah
ya
correct ya ya
ya
sassy ah
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked uh najhah about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many eh
maybe at most twenty plus lah but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as naruto and all that with like five hundred and two seasons eh three seasons eh in all that kind of
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
I guess ya lor like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
ah

ya
it's like ya
and then it's like whoa full frontal wow
what
okay lah at least you were like considered legal
oh ya that's true
so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly lah it supposed to be a little like teng teng teng I mean
oh yikes
it scarred you
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
um
oh
okay okay
ah
ya ya ya
it's true though
I wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like
the strange perceptions that I had of like relationships hmm
mm
ya
oof
we haven't even graduated
right
oh my god ya
that's that's the thing sia
oh burn burn
ya

in-law

promote it through mass comm yes

mm
mm

just to soak
mm
mm
okay
mmhmm
hopefully not no one manifest something bad lah
mm
yes
ya
yes
mm mm ya
oh
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
oh
queue again lah from the back
mm then
oi
mm
the area lah
mmhmm
ya ya you did you did
mm
yes
mm
hmm
mm I was contemplating on what
manifest
temek
oi
twenty eighteen
mmhmm you still cannot say his name
yes his prints are like a cow
on the world map but black and white
you were you
yes
ya
mm
mm
sec
five
seventeen
mm
ya
ya
but
ya
ya
yes
what
yes
very small
hmm this is small already
mmhmm
mm
mm
ya
mm
is this
there's less demand hence there's
no
well less demand equates to higher price lah because there's
no more saturation of market
for there to be a
mm
ya
I think I think lah they will start to downgrade the price but it's not
decrease they will decrease the price but it won't be soon
mm
ya
mm no choice lah
mm
yes
mmhmm
mm
well ya I didn't miss the outside though
no no no the house
I like your room but I didn't like the outside
oh that okay
ya
um
yes
mmhmm
yes
mm they are very very nice yes I agree
the room is nonsense ya
ya your female friend that one
something like curry or stew or something
mm
mm
mm
you will considered it
for yourself
then there will be two rooms and so you rent out the whole thing
mm
mmhmm
mm yes

oh so this one is um actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding kan
tru
um but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
oh ya lah that one I think normal lah since my time many years ago also same also lah the thing ya so I think uh ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for lor at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least lah
oh because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
mm I think I think in this case ah I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental lah but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya gemod lah gemod is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know uh his side ah
hundred fifty ya seh hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise lah it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate lah that is another alternative ah other alternative then your side then ah then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech oh wah like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
uh bottom line you both must tel
err got two choice if want to combine the
then err you and hairin you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his uh no need then you leh you just you just invite lah whoever that is important between your lis
err then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think um at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all lah ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually um pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push ah you no need to type ah you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes ah food ah food dishe
you will you will see like ah how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
uh tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of eh um
uh what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place lah then after that uh if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
uh then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
ah so then from there oh then you all like oh okay lah then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
ah so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline lah so that even though you got five months uh to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say khatib uh when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like uh the cabinet or whatever because I believe uh you got to check that one lah renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask err K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this lah there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that ah so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it lah that is one part of it ya so ya lah so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care kan
my only thing is that okay if he's uh you all have to like let's say workout lah the thing lah workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it uh on i
oh I think uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years lah or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking err is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay kan then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that ah
uh take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming lah so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but err we have to burden one of the side lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat lah kan
okay so err if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then uh so you spend lavishly ah your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion uh of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
oh ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide lah
ah what they want lah ah because I thin
err mix up what is it like like you think that oh what I want to have oh I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it lah
in other in one I read about in err on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift ah how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow lah no need lah I pay now loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
ah but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the oh your partner ah really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either um
like I said lah is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
uh get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like err like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya lah she wants the opinio
ah there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like err the person uh then where the family said firmly talk oh it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that uh kind of situations o
err kills the that particular portion lah but in this younger generation in your generation err things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get flat eh they must buy a condo or private propert
ah high ceiling income but then err there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know ah and then they finally got it ah then but there's a word then the reaso
err a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple lah ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no lah to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already ah
like very stress then me leh then ho
uh you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception um but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and ah both ways lah both parties lah so uh people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
ah then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then um you can't convince your parents lik

okay
mm
what type of superpower I want ah
because err even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
um
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
um ya it's not a
err
err to fight crime
like
err and they don't just fight
err those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
uh
uh
mm
mm
bat batman or iron man
uh
mm
specific
ability is to fly
mm
mm
powers
doctor strange mm
uh
oh
mm
orh
mm
mm
ah
ya hogwart that one ah
ah
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
mm
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation ah
teleportation boring ah
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train kan you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
mm
mm
okay
mm
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
mm
um
mmhmm
mm but people need what
okay when you are rich you might not feel that oh money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million lah not not like that lah
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
mm
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
err
let them err
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
mm
it's a
power
ah
ah where you can give to people
uh huh
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
mm
but how
I think that one is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
mm
mm
mm
mm
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that err no need to work lah
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that eh why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
mm
mm
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe err
err
err superman is boring lah or maybe the flash
or
mm
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
uh
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
uh superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
mm mm
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
mmhmm
ah
okay next
no no that one they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one lah who will fight
wonder woman
err something like that lah the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
err letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once mah
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple uh
ya right
ya
apple apple lah the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
uh
they'll new movies will go into
that one produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
ah
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
ah that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
uh this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money lah it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and err upgrade their
account
from one person only
mm
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount mah to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward eh you
mm
mm
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
mm
mm
uh
orh
orh
okay
mm
superpower
mm
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
ah ya lah what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
mm
mm
ah
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people
mm
so what the batman need to do from
actually
burdensome

thor has a lot of flaws
thor has a lot of flaws
he can't be the king of his own
people
ah ya lah
that that is flaw lah
and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws
mm

on
err
the sound that involves in each movie
might not
come out with
the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal
so they are the the problem is that sound that's coming out of the
might not be the same setting
might be differ from house to house lah maybe that's the only problem lah
ah

ma dong seok
korean
this is not a mini series

people have to break up from that stigma lah because normal scene is to resume
sooner or later
which is what they're trying to implement the normal fee that's why they need people to get their face together
ya
cause they cannot handle high volume everyone the whole of singapore come at the same place at the same time they cannot handle ya

who we have to look up to I thought that you say that mummies are also superheroes
so these are all superheroes that are in are in actual real life also
but but when we're talking about superheroes we can talk about anything
ya lah ya lah this is what people should do
ya
to be superhero in our life
ya lah
mm

hi hamzah
uh no contract ah
um ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but I think minus fifty because got voucher
um
every month
pay fifty five so it's almost double ah
okay bottom western epitope so calculate um mahjong
what okay two years eh so it's two years times fifty five dollars
times twenty four months kan about extra seven hundred dollars ah kan
but iphone eleven uh how much ah iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one lah I think thirty two
okay
um
ya I check a bit the difference is about the incoming I think free eh same ah same um
twenty I think
I think
maybe less than ten ah maybe seven also
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
um ya lah almost four years ah
ah that's why
ah sorry again
oh but but that time kan that time I pergi tu apa um challenger kan iphone seven
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars I think seven ah but seven also like
also present lobang ah no haunted
ah no contract
but
no but
oh oh K then
oh
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
mm
but
ya but now starhub plan ah the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone X
no what are they doing
ya
oh
oh then uh how how's your job search
then um
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now eh all the interview ah
the developer they eh you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
this kind of coding test kan
oh
the the you must type the code inside
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
mm
okay
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
ah I think they really keep calling you know
it's like
very pushy ah so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
ah what is the maximum lah the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm ah kan because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit ah pointless kan
so like
ah I forgot the word lowball ah something like lowball ah
no no value ah kan
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
it's not permanent ah but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
be eager to you know um ya
join the company like this
ah mostly
so tuition
but ya that's why
so that time middle of october kan so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months ah kan so actually
I think one or two weeks before ah two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right ah so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest ah maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same ah one week difference I think
the normal tech
huh
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group ah then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better lah until october
data entry lah you know those
just typing on excel kan basic ah
ah office ah and typing or sending email those basic admin work ah
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description kan is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said um they said okay monday to friday the timing is um I think
about five to ten ah or four to ten like five hours ah or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
um for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply um sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear ah
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer ah so
like but mostly mostly also must support ah because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support kan
so phone support is a bit too much ah you know
ah that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable kan it's a it's it's python programming considered high level kan
uh they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
mm
it's called ah fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
ah C sharp
huh golac
G G O L A C eh
oh golang
mm
okay then
because
building kan
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these ah data and then maybe
a bit of support ah the support kind of role ah
because like for me last time I work in a bank kan
twenty nineteen ah twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
kan
that time I work in a bank kan so
so um laymans kan the back end ah so
you know logs kan you know logs
L O G S ah log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out lah
then investigate maybe or something
um the front part is a investigation ah
but the it's like ticket ah like they say what
support and ticket and then
uh raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close ah
then last what you call that analyse ah whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite um interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called uh run the bank ah not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means um
it means that the the app is ongoing ah you understand like it's not a project ah that means the project already finish that means it's live ah live product being used by users ah
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china uh all this so the timezone all weird weird one
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us what
ya then their working hours until our six what so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues what I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic eh
ah nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven ah because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead what only lah then just wake up what that time
because there's two countries new york eh no two states
new york and where ah san francisco right ah
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server ah
I don't think so ah or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank ah our local bank so ya the business not so much ah
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this ah this basic functions ah kan
oh they call it the green eh green lane eh
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that what
they can come
ah they they can say ah ya they can use the fact that their house right at clementi need to do something ah right collect the mail the mailbox ah because
um
but the the tenant kan you know the eh now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail ah
who
okay
cousins uh
they I think busy also ah
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight ah
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
huh
mm
so there's money
it's not in the fridge eh
oh
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the eh fry the fish first right
I think the it ah the the the preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife ah hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid ah
but it's it's good if you have a maid ah but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house kan so one maid right um share our woodlands house
they maybe my future house or your future house ah so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else ah like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first ah
hmm
ya
no but I think
internally kan if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off ah right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal ah because um as long the maid
huh
normally the maid off sunday kan one day off kan
ya
but I think they're a bit
eh
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map kan is fixed ah
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual ah
ya then if the stock finish
oh wah cool ah
so call move ah
I think no but
I think I think ah Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental ah
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface ah the mapping kan the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue ah kan
but they they can they will monitor your work ah
oh ya ah standard meeting ah kan
oh last time that time zoom you all also use zoom ah
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people kan during the COVID
really ah
huh they going to open here ah
ya but singapore smart ah I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues ah
oh good ah ah are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not ah now
ya
oh open already ah I don't know ah
half ah
I think half of that
eh I think because I think
susah nak apa kita
ah predict the people kan because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
oh actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those um
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what ah counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot ah like last time I went I went exchange also same ah I I
because most people will eat solo ah because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person ah then you face the you face nobody ah like you know face like a the wall or something ah so it's like against the wall kan
ah actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
serangoon garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor lah you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting ah like like al-ameen at our place the the woodgrove kan
ya open concept ah like is is like sheltered lah
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person ah then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side tau that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you ah or three of you kan will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing ah but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then ah section off like one table instead of six right become four lah you know
I mean they can do that lah but I think
maybe today they change lah because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news ah then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner ah for because actually right like very strict ah I mean eh it's it's not the kan
uh eh it's so they are very strict ah
so
I think some of the
kan complain ah like oh call police ah I don't know what they call ah they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually oh at first maybe they ask them to go out lah say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search ah you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy kan
ya I think maybe like they have a counter lah like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't ah what you call that scan out ah checkout from the place
huh
ah trace together kan
oh that one
oh because of bluetooth ah
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
oh
so like between ah android and they also know what to do right
ya
um
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google ah kan
I don't know ah because like maybe I want to try Google ah but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air kan
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini eh
you can play um I mean you can play the eh what's it called ah the radio station like singapore radio station
ah live streaming ah as long you got wifi lah
so actually from the wifi eh but actually dangerous oh I realise kan they recognise our voice oh
the google home speaker ah I mean the I mean google home ah
because right that time kan my friend kan
so
I ask google ah using my voice ah like when is my birthday or what is my age ah something
then they know ah cause I think like google gmail ah all this something
so like they know uh something like my birthday or my name ah
then because my friend got google phone right
oh there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker ah the google home speaker kan then he ask um like what is my name or something ah
then the google know that it's him then say his name
ah or birthday ah ah I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess what
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person what
ah so a bit scary lah I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community kan instagram or something kan
but if the wifi off kan but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device kan
so will it still listen
um connect you
to the
but default ah but if you ask like questions like um
ah offline what do you call it offline data ah
what basic basic functions ah kan
ya
it's good ah
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon what a lot so
I think because they also got money ah so their apartment like one room one bedroom ah so like those studio ah
got how many version ah I also don't know ah
smart home device ah
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven kan like is there a brand for smart oven now
oh
oh
got smart shower or not I don't know
oh but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there lah because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen ah I don't know
or voice ah
eh but that means right COVID better what if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene kan then I think maybe future ah singapore the lift also maybe smart kan
or lift system
I think can make right
oh the base I mean there's a pedal kan
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working ah so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens kan too many screen one is left one is right kan
because you card is only one level ah

the membership the program itself is like it's quite interesting you need to like you only have to clock in ten thousand steps a day like for five days out of seven days a week and then you get like cashback you get like vouchers and stuff like that which I thought was pretty cool

when you deposit money lah whatever you know you get the interest returns right like how many percentage per annum that kind of thing
so they are trying to like like coerce you ah okay like you know like it's so
like for example um per annum is I think zero point zero five or something like that but then they're offering three to four percent
which is actually a lot lah and it's like when they showed me the like they they generated the err returns and like the the sum assured and stuff like that and then I saw the paper and everything and then like eh can earn big bucks sia actually from this but it's not an investment it's just a savings plan

err do you think we should stop the recording now
okay but you have to keep
talking because
you
but if I talk and then you don't respond to me then what's the point of me talking
okay but so are you checking it now
should we just end it how do we end it do we just stop or what
now
okay okay okay

I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to um another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
mm
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you ah they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
ah so
yes ya
then you can you can use their err
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you lah I'm not sure about your personal one but my school one has like
um my school's background
err you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show lah
mm
K
mm
so when you click share screen right
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
it will show everything that I go
everybody can see that
but
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share lah share
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
ah you stop share lah
ya so you just stop share
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
mm
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say um they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that one is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
allow
she chose don't allow
pick the stop video I mean I mean ah like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
mm
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
thumbs up thumbs down
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands uh put down your hands yes no
err thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs ah hands up
ya usually at the participants area lah
ya then like just now you can like
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want siti instead
so siti ya and then other basic things is err okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
okay so you can choose between like err record on your laptop or record on cloud
and then I had to record the classes
ah I chose
the first mistake was I chose uh to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
mm so so I had to I had to
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
mm ya
and then some basic things like chat
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host uh even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which err will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
uh instead of everyone there's like person ah other people's name all the participants' name lah then they will have like bracket privately
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
it will be altogether
mm ya but that's just like
mm other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
forty people
so I will just
I'll just be like err there will just be a notification that pops out uh proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait lah
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
mm
mm I guess so lah but like
cause
I get
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just err
it will just be somewhere here lah
like ya
google meet or live outlook something like that lah
mm
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people lah
mm
but just now you had you had something on
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
mm but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries lah
ah
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
ah
oh
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
huh
the gavin err
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation what
oh then the escape room is they create or what
welfare pack kan everything is online now what so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff ah
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with lah so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like err cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical one or something like that but like
maybe maybe ya then they
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather um if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay what to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that lah
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried lah we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that lah like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
mm
and then like initially I wanted to
uh produce like three different
to produce one instead
engage in home-based businesses
like it was supposed to be
release
oh it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of uh
they open lah but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
err we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
woohoo
ya our target was four hundred dollars
four courses a'ah
err each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my um
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half lah like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible what it's not to rely on like
kan so like that's what he said lah he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
mm but ya not not there yet not as
mmhmm mm
ya then we're like that's quite true lah
um no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is oh third is excel and forth is um
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like err in our faculty there was there's another group
oh by the way I won a giveaway from them
ya it's a just a makeup set lah ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
oh ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
ya
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course lah ya
and then fast forward err
like
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him lah I was like oh will you be interested oh I ask his number from my friend and then after that ah I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
ah but ya it's just it's
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
uh two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like uh extra class notes and he even like answered err post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
oh but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
oh he was err he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like uh ya
prestigious one lah but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
mm really meh
mm okay lah ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like wow
how is someone that smart
ya
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
oh the Staple B is it
bento set
oh
mm
but like what does his dish contain
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
oh
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at novena
so is that good
oh
how is going to earn from that
ah
so food court lah
that's basically a food court
mm
that's a food court
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
mm no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
ah it's focus more if your if your room is conducive lah but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all what I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
like I don't even know how people study in tampines hub
the basement kan you're talking about the basement right
ya the is twenty four hours what
ya I mean how can people go inside without going inside the area
ya
oh no cause COVID then now they
oh but library now they open
I think
bugis the national library and like some bigger national libraries like tampines library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online lah
like I don't mind studying outside but
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is oh my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that one my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams err assignments to do
six
all different lah so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
twenty four hours ah
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can lah but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you lah but
like it's not not
neh
no but it was
it was so much time lah I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
huh
no lah
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
oh you look at
exactly ya
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
oh no but
but one thing bad about online school was that err
orh okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module lah but
ah generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
no the answer is no
oh that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
like err
about the same so let's say
in this uh my first mod then my second mod right I have like um my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
um let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like eh it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like yay no exam fun what then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like huh why I never knew until I experience it
and my major err
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words lah
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major one
and then two thirteen november okay then this one is okay lah relax lah
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two lah but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam what like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time lah then now I think
some period
now and
two eh no week six that's the crazy period lah cause that's the like now now is my chiong period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster lah
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
that's that
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
err result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
mm
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you lah
ya
huh
oh no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments kan
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case lah cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that what then I think they don't want lah
ya but
I guess it's it's okay lah
like
mm will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did lah
ya
ya
it's like
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni lah I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay lah I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
ya and then after that
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
mm
mm
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like oh
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
uh our sem two kan sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email lah they said like oh like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
so they said cannot lah like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there lah
ya
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything lah
but the thing is my
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again lah cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
you have to wait
you have to wait another year lah so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do um online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause uh you're it's actually taking
right
no it's not
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if uh
they don't let
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck lah we just we just trying to ask but
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then um the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
and obviously the school will not allow it lah
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore what if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can lah which is damn unfair cause it's just like
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
eh
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous lah
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first ah so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options ah to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay lah no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now what it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
oh ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision what remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya oh did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know lah
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report lah
ya but no the thing is
mm like cause some people notice like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
then like people like
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything lah
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know ah just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
uh what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release err a statement lah saying like oh increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know lah look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
um my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like oh like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous lah
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report lah like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic ah
like everytime another one comes and then like uh yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that what

okay clap
hello hi madir

okay okay
okay
okay

okay
okay
okay okay
mm okay lah angry lah
okay
mm okay oh okay okay
ya okay
okay
huh oh
okay
okay
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion ah ya
okay
a bit greasy ah
oh most of your friend also do at fort canning ah
okay
I see

true also
okay
okay
ya lah ya lah ya lah cause you want what you want lah okay
okay
but that will be strange
mm
peranakan day ah so I think ya I have to go there early
mm
okay so that part
ya I have to ask dewi to do research lah then from there
ya lah and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding mah
okay
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
mm
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause err lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
mm okay
ya
whether to see okay
mm we can go up and see ah

is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
oh then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again ah
then everything finished at twelve thirty
eh wait ah
I remember is a eleven to three ah ya
okay
ah I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
err
that is the main main core concept
oh I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
she don't care
yes
ah that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
then one thirty
lunch time

I haven't decided whether to
to stay stick with the same class or
change
ya I think but less movement now lah
less moving around in school
shouldn't be lah it should be easier for the teachers
during this period

sorry ah why why what happened
okay which man U game was that mm
oh I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david moyes you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when thiago was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
ah
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games ah
am I right okay never mind err who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch tau it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw thiago go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
mm
okay
uh huh
that philosophy ah
okay
the same louis van gaal were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
mmhmm
okay
ya
okay
mmhmm
okay
I see
okay
wow
so he's like the empty football guy
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
okay that's that's the same school ah
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
mm mm
just whack ah basically ah
a'ah
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya
klopp denies you space mourinho mourinho gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with ah but ah okay lah I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean wow wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the team from the start ah eh how's your by the way
sial ah for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer ah
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years ah actually I can play on my iPad also kan
err I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically err ah I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
err so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated err Netflix show
okay but anyway err
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix lah cause
what happened was uh when september now eh so last month err
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
err I was like okay lah feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
hey there's this anelka documentary on Netflix
ah have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this anelka documentary ah so so it's uh it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause err
raymond dominic actually like uh had a an argument with anelka
I got into Netflix cause of that anelka documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows lah but some like err okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai ah
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like oh they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation ah
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
uh am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like oh you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting lah like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it lah so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and err it's about how this guy err I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder err ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you lah but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town lah that he's in
ah it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean ah okay lah so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places ah one is err knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america uh
err K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so ah basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is err you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that lah
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so uh and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then err and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story err
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted ah I mean in the movie they they they
ah not not just inner demons ah I mean they are just they are evil people ah you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is ah robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something kan
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but eh but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show ah
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie ah
ah well he doesn't he doesn't molest children ah
a'ah
okay
are you sure you want to say this on err are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box ah
oh is it
so basically it's an lah
okay okay
ah
oh is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya lah they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five ah it's like not not even ah
ya ya
mm mm
mm
ya
mm mm
ah ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl kan
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
mm
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that uh they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no lah
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's uh not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
err groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans lah
because of this ah so
so I mean like in singapore dee kosh obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
a'ah
okay
ah
okay
alright
oh my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through ah
okay
ah
okay
he's he's a good kid ah
okay
a'ah ah ah
ah ah
okay
oh okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him oh you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya lah cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that upskirtism
so he actually did it
look eh look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates ah bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name ah but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes ah
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him lah like I I remember of
his existence back this in ah
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally lah cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know ah maybe we're we're looking at it differently lah maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation ah from what I understand lah
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum ah
sorry syed ahmad we didn't mean to mention your name
oh okay
oh okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
ah we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time ah
a'ah
ah
okay
uh huh
uh huh
okay
ya
okay
mm mm
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way ah perhaps ah
a'ah
ah
mm
ya
mm
ya
well I mean what can you say ah these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on ah
and I guess people are just
following trends ah just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common ah you know nowadays you have mosque
ya lah but you still had your your function in a activity hall ah my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
err I mean there there are some huh
err subject to any of these trends I feel lah
you can lah you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
ah
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that ah you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house lah I don't know whether I told you
bro sengkang bro raeesah khan
oh sorry was that too loud jamus lim
err unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not sengkang but it's okay
no no this is ang mo kio so
ah sorry ah every conversation between zulika and myself must involve some degree of politics lah then you know there's some spice ah
so uh we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come uh we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good ah ah
I I don't want to play games ah I mean I think I would draw the line at games ah
ya
my wife my wife and I oh but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife ah okay
a'ah
okay
wah
that's a very productive err your time bro
oh okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad eh you you should talk
oh my god okay
ya lah he hasn't changed his name yet lah
okay
yes yes yes yes
uh
okay
ah
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see oh ya ya ya ya ya
err so I think his brother died or something eh
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them ah okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago sia
okay
huh
I I've never watch game of thrones ah by the way
of course ah bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
oh okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me ah no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true ah
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it oh ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
oh my god I I thought this was over sia bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
ah
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
a'ah
sial lah bro you could have read all the books seh in all that time sia bro
oh I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that err I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently lah so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys lah so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay ah
a'ah
a'ah
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
hey siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
ah all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful lah I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
a'ah
uh huh
it automatically scans the code oh okay
it goes in a anti clockwise eh clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
eh so so so err we're coming to the end
okay
oh I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's

oh ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
oh ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
okay
oh ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that lah they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
ya
different timing
ya
can
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely lah I mean you cannot meet lah but
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
oh ya just five of us lah
without partners lor
mm
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us what
korean ya that ah
farin birthday
oh
oh yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners lor that
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya okay
ya
um
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work lah
ya
mm
ya lor
monday right
is it really
ya
oh
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
hais
okay lor we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
then he say it's like seven hundred oh my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred sia
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
you are in a cold room
whoa but luckily I went taiwan sia just before lockdown
ya
err not as good as that one we we went that time
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
hais
hais ya
ya
eh but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
um ya
but you know the that time the who say ah which minister
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably lah elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations lah wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel lah
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
was there lah oh my god
mm
err they have another issue to tackle there oh my god
mm
are you talking about succulent
oh
the normal one cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
mm
oh I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what sia cardboard
oh what
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
hais anyway I have an assignment on an essay lah so I need just err your your point of view lah I guess
mm it's about um
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
why
mm
ya
true leh ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
mm
ya
mm
good what lockdown good what I was enjoying the period
mm
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems lah rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
oh
ya
mm
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel lah like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation lah so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway err
ya lah alhamdulillah I need the money so what's the problem
to avoid this err to convert their platform store into online platform lah so
mm
true I mean you will lose your human touches also lah right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
err
I think it brings families together
kind
that's all lah like
so
ya
I know
not every family can get along lah hundred percent get along so
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one wah then
ya
right ya
mm
ya obviously
ya
mm
true
mm
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better lah because you know carbon footprints were reduced lah I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit lah of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight lah like just
ya
ya
ya
okay lah at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress lah I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit leh
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
mm
ya
maybe they did lah like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
not counsellors lah what what is it calling
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
ya
mm
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes lah but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya eh can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society lah I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case lah on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water one
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito one
it's true okay lah but that's not really a problem I guess
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down lah
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel lah at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot leh
is it
aren't we not at the top
oh we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest lah
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to lah but it's not possible lah per se
oh my god
oh that one that they kill all the animal ah but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus what ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
they have to kill all the the chickens mah
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
yes
mm
uh huh
ya inside the middle ah
uh huh
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese err ah swiss cheese plant
stop it lah
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times leh
what is a prayer plant
mm
ya
mm
but monstera is an indoor plant what right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
mm
ya
ya
technically they are bushes lah weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
not really leh
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt leh
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer lah but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
err the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk leh like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also what light can ah
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
can ah
ya probably can lah I don't know
I don't know it just grows short lah from small to big lah I guess shoots ya
hais
no oh my god that one
no meh
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
ah
mm
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office uh condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
aiya very the
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
aiya you don't know one lah
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
mm oh my god
mm
hais
mm
spray is it then
mm
ah
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
mm
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also what if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
mm
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
mm ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die sia
hmm
oh my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough lah too much plants ah mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant eh
oh no
aiya you don't know one lah
it's like a fern anyway
hais
you don't have class so what you gonna do tomorrow
like for for the whole week to say
ya lor

but technically they don't like understand why is it called like you know inflation and then
err haven't planned yet eh for everything leh

it was it was it was like I mean I did have some like experiences like some weird ass
huh have
it I I join brownies you know that one with brown with the yellow scarf I promise to do my best oh my god it was just it was a scout ya but then again the secondary school like I mean I join evergreen like so it's like
no lah it was more of the guy I forgot what's his john something
it it's switzerland I forgot what's the guy's name shit but ya you have to remember the different geneva conventions things like that
so like in a way I guess I was learning
I guess I guess in a way I eh I I guess in a way I was learning about sociology early in the day lah oh actually ya now I know why I pick sociology LOL but ya
it was interesting it's just that my special ya like I said lah are my specialisation was red cross knowledge and first aid I was gonna take an evac gold but
I
I got sick I got sick during my first aid goal and my evac gold the test because we had to go to the to take the like test lah but I was sick I couldn't make it so I was like I only had like
everything was bronze except for my ah red cross knowledge ah I found it I was sad but at the same I didn't give a
I didn't care
I mean at that time lah I mean who cared lah right
eh what was your scene secondary school
first school
mmhmm
oh captain's ball
cook right
you didn't have to take home econs as a subject no eh for us it was compulsory everyone had to take home econs D&T
but ya I mean in primary school right I didn't take per se because my school like sports right was a compulsory like
you know like you had to take different music we had to learn different musical instruments you had to learn different sports I had to learn floorball
uh huh
uh huh
shit your basic really zero
stay in stay in beat ah
oh
is it like was it F F
or something I don't remember I don't remember I don't remember I honestly don't remember it was such a long time
oh ya the the
I had to learn in primary school
recorder ah the long one flute is at the side ha then uh
oh ya then in secondary school my school ask us to learn gamelan I I I was in charge of the big gong
not the big gong is like one side is smaller than the other side is bigger you know that what oh no it's the I I at first I was gong I was in charge of the gong
then what ah I was in charge of the gong but it's like
um
I forgot what's the name but ya I I was in charge of the gong but it's like
no it's uh fusion so they mix malay chinese indian dance
they mixed it around lah I mean I wasn't a fan of dancing I mean I learnt dancing before it's just that
tchoukball or something is it the one you throw them net they had through at the net
I don't remember floorball tchoukball I don't remember ya I mean we did play uh captain's ball a lot I was always the goalkeeper
cause I was great at catching balls I was good at no pun intended but ya ya ya I played a lot frisbee uh I played basketball in secondary school then rugby was like my final like touch rugby was my final
we learn
okay lah
that's why in like you know secondary school I was so fit then the moment I went to poly I gained so much weight because I didn't do the same amount of physical activity I was eating I was still having like unhealthy lifestyle I slept like like irregular eat irregularly also ya it's okay now I can tell people I tried a lot of things that's why I tell people what I'm a jack of all trades master of none
but ya I think primary school and secondary school there's a lot of like ghost stories sia ya especially you know you go to camps
do you do you have any camps like do you guys have any like
ha okay you continue
oo
mm
we loved it
yes
is it that's not really horror though more of thriller right it's the it's the kid who pretended to it's the adult who pretended to be a kid right because she had some disorder right
oh
oh shit
ah
it's it's like haunted house lah kan it's like it's like during our camp lah kan
yikes
faci faci
he stare at you no I mean for me my night walk I mean I had a I had like camps lah primary school
what is it ah
one of the the the the guys right one of the army one of the army stories
no not the not the one that the guy died with the the not with the intestines all over the floor one it's the other one is the the one that he offended the offerings or something then
ya because he mummy boy ya that place lah the that that place they used as like the no it was at a camp I don't remember but I think it's now closed is it sarimbun is sarimbun closed I don't remember it was I think sarimbun because I remember sleeping on those bunks
ya but ya when I had those night walks right it was
okay because night walks right what they did was that the line the route with glow sticks tau
they line the route with glow sticks then the
the like you are free to walk ah
it started out fine but right it's like
like when how say eh uh
it started out fine but it's like err when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
everyone was showered
everyone finished showering already
kan if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
creeped the heck out of me
aik
mm
yikes
they just stayed there lah so bad in everything smelt then the house smelt
no they say that
LOL
uh huh cause I watched that one
mmhmm
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess err I don't know lah I mean allahu alam ah eh
that's why I say I don't know you go Google lah I don't know what else ah
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
people correct
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
no it's
islam
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean uh you hear stories that sometimes inside the
mm they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right eh no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it lah
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so mm I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
mm
mm
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also what they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while uh psychological study said that oh it's just like uh was it what seh
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
like you said what they can uh what is it ah they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night lah around four
what
no shit oh hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby oh my god ha
mm that's why ah
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the uh door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia lah you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
I think oh I don't know I do know there some bomohs in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise ah
mm
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff lah but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay lah it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya oh because it will like corrode or something is it oh ya ya
okay
but ya
I don't know some
ah ya something like that I'm not sure
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
but this ya
err accord sort is it they show you stuff
like and stays forever
ya boy
mmhmm
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
ha
I don't know I mean depends on the family uh because you are unless
you not supposed to say this lah but unless the
pass to you
no lah what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
ya I think so it's an agreement lah basically you are agreeing what if you nod it's a form of agreement what no matter
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
how to say eh
I
lame okay and my mum said lah my mum said lah eh she said that the thing picks a master that is like
for real

okay ah ayuni how are you
okay uh so today what are we going to talk about
are you okay I think the first one is I saw is europe highlights for eleven days
uh wah this is italy switzerland
germany france belgium and netherlands
ah went switzerland first then after that we the last stop is germany
capital germany
ah yes eh berlin
B E R N bern
yes fly back from bern correct
we go to switzerland means ah land zurich
mm
ya ya
very nice
that was like two weeks
ya
ya fourteen fourteen days or I think lesser maybe lesser because inshriah cannot take like
ya long leave
scottish
so you want to go to scotland right
mm
mm
maybe
yes but the thing is
ya lah you you have to follow tightly to their
to the schedule
okay so why do you want to go to
scotland
okay
so they project the country very well lah in that
interesting noraini
thank you for sharing with me
and
do you know what I see next
it's um a package eleven days and eight nights
and the heading is spectacular scandinavia
ya that was like
last year's planning
yes
ya sweden right eh no
no no I didn't go to
mm mm
yes
I flew to sweden first
ya
so from stockholm I stay a few nights there
explore the city
how fate brought you together
yes and and you know what what they put here
fish market
ulriken cable car it's the one that we took right ulriken and bryggen but bryggen is what is it the along the
coast
bryggen B R Y G G E N
I do
mm
ya
so here they said set off on an epic journey to the nordic countries where you will see the capitals of denmark sweden and norway so I recall that time the the guide right
ask us like what's the
what's um which countries
are in the scandinavian which countries are ya
navia
ya
which as finland
so it's actually denmark sweden and norway
these three are the scandinavian countries
uh
actually colours of the leaves
mm
wait but northern spain
so what are the country
okay
interesting
so he drives I mean
ya actually when that time during the road trip with I mean we engage the driver kan ya
yes
so we can consider chey
or the other alternative
but like what
the not so
but that time you went you oh you went london only
it's okay
oh yes
but eh err portugal is
who ah the
iffah iffah's choice right
is it
ya
she's getting married leh she go with the husband lah
ya
but portugal ya
hais when can we travel ah
uh exact date I'm not sure but I know it's
february um coincides I think with chinese new year
yes
so when is chinese new year
I don't know leh
no I think should be
I think err mid eh
should be mid right
ya I think so
who who getting married
but all in like um
you shouldn't have made that statement
yes I'm from griffiths primary school
come on
ah I don't
maybe if I see the face I can somehow recall lah but
seems familiar
from griffiths primary ah thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
mm okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya lah griffiths uh primary is the one next to my place ah
ah
no no ya now renamed to angsana
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
angsana griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
maybe like past years like
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
ah speaking of which
ah
ah
then err
ya
okay lah
ya
so anyway like that ah so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
oh how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
woohoo
wah
so the kid
but he's not present lah for that two months or he's still orh
orh
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer lah in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better lah because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but ya
ya
mm
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
uh ya
oh
ah
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate uh like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the the principals ah
ya uh head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
ya
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know lah what they do
you know settle some like don't know lah some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching eh
ya
I think like can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
orh ah
I think err
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like eh I mean my previous school lah
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
ah
ah
mm mm
mm mm
so so what's the ranking actually for for early childhood like
like
teacher
mm
so I mean like there's
wow so deep sia
where you at what you at what you're at now
yes
ah
okay
ah ah
so priority according to priority
okay name me three
aww
inshallah
okay
no
so it's like practically
so
ya
mm
I think so I do not know maybe
no ah no
ya
ya why I look different
ya lah it has always been this ya but um
ya
but um
something that I need to tell you about this spectacle
no I didn't buy specs I buy something cheaper I buy super glue
so after that ya ya but eh I think is that one is reading glasses maybe
ya
eh it has this listing eh it will stick
orh
orh
orh
then then
hmm
eh that's the functional light right
you buy that all the way from
so the switch is there ah the one
ya
okay what nice what so when you sleep you will switch on that light
orh
ya ya ya I know
I know I sleep with you
huh
ah
huh
wait
orh yes yes yes
oh my god one
on a working day
then what time you woke up just now
then you should feel like
when you're surely
so you know they do it lah now
ya
ya
cause somehow when you're in that situation you know you have to do it you do it right
yes
orh
but because I think you got a lot of things already is it sometimes is the
orh
okay lah ya lah
but uni
ya
because that time I think uh
whether like um like
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya lah
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
ya
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think err central port
it's err geylang geylang
I think ah I think I may be wrong but I guess that's the location
ya maybe it's there or around the area
but I think it should be
east side
because he stays in the east
ya
east coast plan what east coast plan
ya
I think I think bedok area
eh
ya
mm mm

hi
my name is Intan and this is weird
later on like the when the government give like the government um announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give uh you
okay well
well as you know lah kan I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January um there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report uh Singapore reported their first case
like we didn't care so err after that when err Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but err my my boyfriend was like the most kiasu of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most kiasu and he was very irritating
and then is like he just insist ah right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know Tokyo is near
Yokohama no is it is it near I mean like err there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in Tokyo lah so
err we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like err luckily we came back right before when err Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other and um and whatever
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
so I can balance I can juggle my life with err studies I can keep my time occupied eh and like you know just do my stuff
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her lah but as in like the fact is that like stupid sia you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible
oh my god stereotype sia
that's another unwanted
then after that she was like err even at times at times we we I suggest lah okay I say nevermind lah mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked err they they featured some characters like you know um everyday Singaporeans and everything
um like I think one of them was about like uh a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to uh the needy lah basically and uh you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not err feature
food deliverer uh like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like um healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
err like you know like for example they they do a they did a feature on like the uh cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
oh really
oh it wasn't cheap
mmhmm but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
um you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like um not considered
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like err very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
eh what
but in order to in order to get
mm
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that um like
err the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading err um like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
err our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking lah like eh so how ah you think that next year ah no sorry next sem which is like in a month um
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
so so um
err we we were like somehow like quite happy that uh we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then err then we we tested out the Zoom err interface then it of like sucked lah because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then err we had exams
what is that module I took I forgot oh uh it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
so basically we were stuck at home so err like the school has to think about something
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
so this open task err is like
a forty eight hour it opens like uh forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then err it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like err by one thirty on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on lah
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me ah I personally I rather do myself ah because I know I can do it
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a assignment so basically I had to do err
stuff hais like I prepared questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to lah as in like you know when I left
when I left err when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
eh thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful ah sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work lah
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and oh my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
mmhmm
ugh I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive lah I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up lah you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the err that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it lah okay like my my classmates ah my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life kan
and
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
eh
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay lah I I don't think my my err my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture uh eleven uh sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
and then huh
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time err by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that lah so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on err in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free eh uh huh
mm
no because
no no no like like periodically right periodically um err Grab host like have this like err promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer um a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then oh no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
uh the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so err ya
and then err so isn't like basically is this was this uh service available on err Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course lah because now everybody can go out already what
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know Nurul is err Nurul has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya
if Russia if Russia produced I mean if that vaccine claim by Russia is proven effective then maybe we have
we wait wait shorter lah there goes my Korea trip at the end of the year
we will see whether it works or not but ya like I said let me reiterate this point I said that I'm going to misses I'm gonna have to cancel my trip at the end of the year
how many vacations did you go on this year
I went three times okay minus the fact that I came back from Doha
ya but February we are still gooing out to Japan and then after that is like
ya
I think we went to oh ya we went we went to once in March
no no no no I can't remember when err no it wasn't it was before way before like the part
I think it was one week before Singapore said that whoever who left overseas have to go undergo like quarantine or whatever
Fernando
I know but he she he was so antsy to leave the house like whatever it takes
I swear to god but whatever is it up I think it's up
okay three more minutes of talking shit
wait
you are not young anymore you know this is not like ten years ago
this is not ten years ago already okay hello I remembered when we were it was ten years ago we we used to sit
like for hours doing nothing and doing crap on on internet
ya oh shut up
ya I'm I'm going for a class that I'm paying for so thank you very much and it's my holidays now so I'm chilling
whatever

mmhmm
assignments
mmhmm hmm
mm mm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya ya like
ah
mmhmm mmhmm hmm
mmhmm true true true true true
I mean to me it's good in a way like um all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to um the recordings lah because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching ah like ya as you said ah traditional traditional methods are the best ah
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like aiya I appreciate lah they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
mm mm and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all lah like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya lah I really appreciate that part ya
mmhmm I mean
okay it's really draining
err cause like the
ya then um like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days ah for forty eight hours ah so that was really crazy ah
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest lah because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
um
uh know
ya like
um hmm so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean uh I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like um it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given lah so it's really appropriate lah I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya mm
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time ah
um ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us lah err beforehand she was like um ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like huh really forty eight hours then she she she was like
ah later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like
okay now I understood why
but ya I mean
ah I mean like I think she she I mean I I scored well so ya I'm good
there there were like um five sections ah five questions five five questions
no sorry uh five questions ah
can you hear me well
can you hear me well can you hear me
really now
now
now how about now
no difference eh wait eh let me see
hello

mm mm mm
mmhmm
ya ya ya true true
ya ya ya ya exactly exactly
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh my god
oh my god you guys are in the same boat ah eh
uh huh huh huh
ya ya ya ya true lah like cause
true true true true true true true
ya lah like
ya cause like um ya I get what you mean what you trying to say
I think I think most most of our most of my lecturers are good I just appreciate them so much ah like this sem cause they were like
ya they they they they ask us ah like um are you guys okay
um ya like um if you I mean you know some some wouldn't be okay with like having group assignment right
cause like due to I don't know maybe different time zones or such so they like give us like um options if you want to do like if you want to go for like individual err individual or like group assignment ah things like that lah so like they like I would say they cater and accommodate to us ah to our needs ah
but then ya she mentioned ah like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
oh they usually ask us to tell the students that it's
okay uh
I mean like to go lenient on them ah but then she she like somehow like rant to us ranted to us ah she was like but then they never
uh take care of their like the the the lecturers lah like cause they are also like going through new things right like to have like a full-fledged ah online classes is equally like very uh what difficult for them lah basically
um so it's like ya it's like a new thing mmhmm cause
mm mm mm ya ya ya ya true true true true
mmhmm
ya ya ya
mm mm mm
oh really
mmhmm
oh

uh she okay it's about afterlife ah basically
so it's like they haven't offered the heaven or the hell kind of thing ya so it's like the good place I mean in a sense is like the heaven and the bad place is the hell
so ya so she realised that she's bad and she's placed in the good place then she was wondering lah like
um she actually shared err same name with the other with another person and ya she's supposed to actually be placed in the bad place
and that ya that particular person cause that particular person is a lawyer so she she's she's I would say she's done good lah like I mean she she ya she fight for people and all right so ya lah so she's also like why am I why am I in the bad place and such so I mean you should watch ah

of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her ah
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
that guy ah then that eventually
um
living off from her wealth
was actually very very very
um
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama ah
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage ah because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
uh you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this uh phrase
ya
but
uh they got divorce but then
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
um
she like restrained herself
in this kind of thing again ah drama again
ya
mm
but then I heard that
I mean lah I don't know cause Syamsul Yusof has always been
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love what like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore kan
because I heard that he stole something and everything
but
I don't know lah how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
oh wells
ya
ya
but
I don't know lah
ah up to him lah he celebrity lah
ya the original price is about three hundred fifty seh and hundred fifty for three hundred fifty treatment
then right I see their steps like firstly they will like massage
then after that they will like put essential oil for you to relax then they will put something for your scalp then they wash
then after that they put like this
beads then they crush it then they put like the medicine the carotese medicine or what
then after that they steam
after they steam then uh
okay already like they blow dry
mm I like I mean I've booked for tomorrow but I don't know what time what time you going school ah

ah
ah
but if most of them okay then should be fine lah I mean
hais you know I I
I have like about
two more one year plus
till I end my work
I never know why
well cause maybe you don't really get sense of security there like everyday it's like it's playing with your anxiety did you do something wrong or not
ya
why I mean like even if I were to continue my studies I don't think I'll be in the same school as you
huh they you mean you don't chiong last minute one
ah
aiya maybe
which captain
oh
ya I I heard that they were going to continue there also but then they already there oh my god

orh
then did they say hi
cause some of the stuff they are like over
overpriced or like they take from Shopee or something
ya tomorrow oh my god ya so right I don't know seh what I I should like spend on cause I budget myself to only spend like three hundred
so like one hundred fifty gone
then maybe like fifty gone for transport and like nine thirty gone for
and a fifty I mean like another hundred gone for eating
so that would be two hundred fifty then I mean I have like fifty dollars left
like what you cannot also buy seh fifty dollars
no I mean for the whole month
ya so confirm cannot save like that
I've been trying to save
that's true some more I pay for the bill and then pay for myself

anyway I think oh my god ya then after that
I need to buy present for Anas
ya and I don't even know what type of taste or do they even have this
ya some more like clothes hard
cause I don't know whether he will like my taste
but he chose to wear it that's the thing it's
no he won't wear purple he say Barney
what serious ah
meh
exactly he is
you know got like those like slim fit regular fit all then I don't know all this guy shit
that's the easiest
err clothes then you have to take into
size the design whether it fits
ya
how is he coping now
in the new work and all
mm
huh
that's true
ya
mm
it's okay lah one day I see him lah slowly
uh
okay lah but maybe my next like three day off I ask him out
but then I scared he go dating ah
cause if he's free he will usually go dating what
do you like study math anymore no right
eh why you don't want to teach the our neighbour anymore ah
mm
because like I heard the kid is really struggling as well
ya and then like he needs to take next year and then
he skip his grades are doing really bad right now
so he really needs help
tuition centre
then it like didn't help him then she don't want to teach him also
people outside seh
ya
but he play with my soft toys
like when he was sick he hug
Didi the dinosaur
and stuff like that
like a little sick cause his mum didn't want him to skip tuition
oh my god I think was only fifty
ya last time you also got paid fifty right
no it was never seventy
it was always fifty Erra
ya that's why I stop
is like about ten ah eleven
or twelve dollar plus
ya still not worth it
some more he's very naughty but
make it to like
make it well
yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
ya
but
people private affairs seh
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
relationship I mean
ever since primary school secondary school and days
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex ah my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell um
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students seh but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that seh and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
so traditional
I don't know lah
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
huh it's not it it's not
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no lah sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then oh ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
don't know
oh my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay lah whatever you young but never mind ah
but she cannot handle the team well seh
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums seh
I remember so many people vomited ah
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what eh I remember she do the stupid like
err push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know ah
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
err the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
eh
uh I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop seh
and like I I feel it's not normal
huh
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
help to
discipline us and make us stronger ah
but actually it's quite bad seh it's like you're not healthy you know
ya
anyway what kind flowers do you like
ya
eh
ya
cause you're like actually attracting insects
cause of the seed
especially when they are like rotting rotting eh what's the word eh
wilted yes for real
wiltering ha ha
antisocial

don't like them you know it's just not comfortable
but even if it's as a baby you will not take it
so that bothers you ah
mm
I see
don't know I also like you like fifty fifty

hard to take in a stranger into your home and make it a home for them
you know what I mean
I know right
I also hate children
ya meow meow I love cats
like they are so cute and tiny I would like
like take seven of them

like
it's like it will fill the void ah
how about rabbit would you keep a rabbit
oh my god

oh okay lah true lah
that time I got go one at Indonesia kan
it's like
they are living in the wild which is really good I love I love animals to live in the wild you know
but I feel that they're not being fed enough

what if they hungry then they eat the tourists
I just scared for the animals

why
I shall begin it tomorrow my hair

I know it's not really that disappointment as my previous hair treatment
but I don't know how long it will last

I get student card back seh
it's like you can spend fifty dollars
for transport in just one or two weeks eh
ya that's right
ya they always go by distance
owe a vehicle
the cheapest is about sixty thousand eh
crazy eh you know sixty eight K in another country can buy
two three cars I think
uh I don't even think they have the
it's just the car
ya but then like other cars I see like two hundred thousand then got until one million all ah
then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos kan
most of them the new ones are built near like
you got see uh is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know
but if you have a family then maybe the executive condos or something ah if you're rich
in like the richer side of Singapore
it's like whoa living the K drama life seh
mmhmm

hi kira
what are you doing
I I ask what are you doing
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
oh okay lah
have you how many times you had to use it so far
ah I used to have to eat a lot of um cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic lah
mm
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was err developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my mm
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
how do I what
mmhmm
ah
but I realised that I didn't react
uh nine months since I've been to the doctor
I should start uh
mm
tangkak
it's
uh is like one or two hours
ya
I think ah the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
juice like the drink yes yes
at that time ah
ya and then
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in um in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
did you um see
ya
wrap wrap
wrap
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
mm
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's err you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
why are you not eating
oh
are you going to cook or what
oh ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
oh how old is she
oh
mm
mm
mm
mm
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
ah ya
ah
mm
like
if she caught me
shower
to make sure that I properly err you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat um olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
mm mm mm
and then err I gave up you know what I did
mm
oh your your cough medication is too much
okay lah kan maybe
hmm
ah you need to take your time lah
mm have you have you done the portal
mm
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
hmm hmm
hmm
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
mm
ah to go to work
mm
but
mm
kan
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
ah ya
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
it's hard
mm actually actually
we would rent a place together ah
mm but don't know lah
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
I think you just have to find the right one
wei you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer lah
oh ah
you know did I explain to you my new title
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
uh the data is from the paper that he published
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
ya
I also agree about the reading part
in a different way
mm so far so far my progress is very little
are we the same
are we the same
last sem
I think kan I think she knows uh means she learn from last sem
and then he said that um farid ask how we how did we do as a class
mm I think it's a bit it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
mm
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
mm
no but you know lah how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
mm I think
the opposite
because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
make sense mm
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
hmm
did you hear about the girl
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
mm
mm
imagine imagine the dad
mm
mm we just have to wait and see
mm
no if my mum is around I don't cook
mm
I do the after part
mm
I think my
excuse me
actually that's why that's why it
mm
hmm
ya
err ah best
ya wei
you know what I grew up on was um how I met your mother
you know have to break the rules
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
exactly you just download the the book the E book
ya my my mom eh my parents have this friend
and then

like I do get recurring dream
that I'm driving in my family's car like the estima
and I don't know how to drive
but I'm really
after I wake up
ya and then actually the the thing that I remember is the feeling of the dream
but I don't remember what the dream was about
that happens a lot to me
mm

mm
mm
mm
mm

uh cause I was
uh in university kan ah
ah ah ah ah I wasn't in london so you know
for my university uh it's already you know out of london so I just go up to manchester lah if I go to london I have to go down to london
to them one of I mean you all look the same you know you know all this uh uh ya
English people so I'll just borrow someone's uh membership
card
and then watch the weekend game or something lah you know and my time don't forget because this is uh nineteen ninety eh
there's no man U wasn't big name
you know
ya it was like you know man city you know um
liverpool everton newcastle um all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian ah kan you know they track track kan
secondly thirdly kan
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
so that was uh always a lot of fun lah you know when I was also a student ah
then fast forward when you mention paris kan I actually uh live there two thousand four two thousand eight
not the duty free but the premium outlet
ah because that one is one stop
oh
euro Disney you see
ah
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet lah
ah dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
mm
mm mm
mm I live err I lived in err
err the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
err
quarter lah they call it ah so I'm literally halfway between champs elysees the arc of triomphe to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night kan
circling circling
so I lived in the really the central part ah
oh so easy for me pasal I just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite uh good
mm ah that's the gare du nord mm mm mm
the museum ah ah
ah
ah
ya lah mm the maghreb areas lah mm morocco algeria you know those kind of places

you know uh
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen ah I suspect will probably
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so

ah
paradigm paradigm mm
uh paradigm about two years about two years ah
mm
ya ya ah
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this lah pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks kan so
ah even for your maid you know today anyway lah eh these days
ah
but generally lah my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
that that's more it lah you know
err not not easy lah to go in kan that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
see the developments but the changes kan since my time there and it's been what you know uh more than twenty years kan almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore

okay orh
ya for me today was okay ah
today today was my off day
of err leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave lah then
err I've been trying to clear so
then like um
today we had some random meeting
about err strength training like err for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water um
like the whole company lah from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to shanghai and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams lah but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test lah before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
mm it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
a bit
ya
ya a bit skewed err ya a bit skewed ah the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
err
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the shanghai branch and then ya we just shared lah then
I went first in that group and when I went first
I took like I think around three minutes lah let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy lah the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like oh err there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown lah to tell them to tell us that the break room is err going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of um shut down on the zoom orh
eh not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay lah not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
good to know lah when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
oh that sucks
mm do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure bo
sure bo
ah
huh
can like that meh
ya
then why you take
ah okay okay understand understand
ya seh
but ya uh
actually my last week was quite interesting ah
not interesting
but
err because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden err he joined the new shift lah
ya my three shift correct
so it like his first day was just me and him
oh no that day he that day
me and jaden
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do err
what was that err had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me eh just tomorrow
err tomorrow what's that ah oh tomorrow
I may not be able to oh no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was ah mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us eh on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge lah on that day
no it's not a big deal lah that job it's just
someone to be um
someone to be who's who will answer to the client lah
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like eh just I think err
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay lah why then he said oh because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad lah
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
I don't know lah I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt lah
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
err okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay lah I told him okay lah then go ahead lah you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day ah then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
um
wah damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not lah but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
um we are now separated into clients ya
oh cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know lah
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day lah because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like eh wait wait wait ah walao walao
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss lah I feel bad
um hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
err I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
eh no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day ah
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working lah
ya eh on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
oh you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve eh twelve thirty
then now it's like err three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
eh for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya lor so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
uh yes but then
um I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes uh
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult uh
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
I'm
my sleep is deprived
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
mm
it's like
if I were to sleep in kan that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team lah at least they are
they are not big fans of
um
this client
this huh
yes but
you can always learn uh you know what I mean
and it's a job ah you are getting paid
plus
ya
you just learn ah you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people uh because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good lah I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
like this current shift that I'm on lah I've been too complacent
um
I don't know I I just I
what's the word ah complacent uh when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like whoa like you know about this like
like oh because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers lah
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it uh
like last month or what then I realised oh shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference ah
whether they
can work with you or not ah like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
reserve
ya
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this um
this file
then like
um from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines lah like what are the headlines for today so
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines lah ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like oh I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it uh when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
mm
often time
but now
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
jaded ya
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
mm
wow
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
no
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
this whatever can pick up
people
mm
mmhmm
it's too loud
okay
okay
mm
ya lah
no but I just
kind of conversation
oh so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay lah I think it is their job lah
a'ah lah
weeb
weeb do you have that in the dictionary weeb
weeaboo
I don't think so please don't
maybe don't ya maybe don't
mmhmm
I don't know is it new
what is it about
mmhmm
okay
don't spoil don't spoil don't spoil for me
ya don't spoil
okay

of movies you know what I mean
to
no no like how they distribute movies overseas in this time you know like do they send the film over is there someone who comes
hilarious
films ah
projector lor
I think that's I think so
probably ah they probably don't live up to the name now probably it's expensive
I think I think projector is the closest we can find to that ah
artefacts like
mm
ya the effect lah but
that's the beauty of it
mm
the actual thing
ya ya
correct correct
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay
that's the maximum resolution ah
mm
four K two thousands
what you mean
mmhmm
mm
yup
mmhmm
mmhmm

ya you were saying like movies
I don't know I want to do something ah sia I want to do something in movies
huh
I have but what are you going to film

no I'm a I can be producer
okay
you sure you trust me

mm
there's different types of
ya lah styles
but that's more like an auteur thing you know what's auteur right an auteur
E R ya something like that auteur yes so like they have their own style of so it's like
christopher nolan or whatever you know what I'm saying
Gong Cha
Gong Cha
okay
okay
mm
okay but okay can but filming is very um it's a very
flexible
project
in terms of you have to be able to be flexible if things don't work out
so if let's say you will have like you said you had a certain shot in mind right
sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your
ya manage your expectations ah
to get that shot you know what I'm saying
calm down
mm
ya lah
yes
yes
ya be a
be a realistic director and a writer
english
mix also can
what kind of themes would you want to input in like the movies that you make
mmhmm
to your brain ya
mmhmm
type of genre right
twist ya
age
understand
mm
what's a movie that you think
psychologically was it like
stimulating for you
mmhmm
okay
ya the one with the natalie portman
mm
mmhmm
uh huh
ya ya ya
but it's not very is it psychological though
it's very it's more nostalgia now
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
mm
yup
ya
ya
mmhmm
yup
changed
and they played around with the splicing and all that
kind of put it upon themselves also what
mm
a'ah
ya
a'ah
mmhmm
and the
ya
okay what other movies
the wailing yes yes yes yes yes definitely
correct
ya
yes
a'ah seh
oh
correct ya right
mm it's every it's all the things that I appreciate in films put together and like whoa I was so surprised eh
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what I mean make me make me question my current relationships with like people that I know like my family even are they the people they are
ya sia
exactly
wah you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not
I forgot about that
a'ah
mm
ya
mm mm
ya
mm
you're also insignificant
correct correct
mm
uh then who did I watch with
this indonesian woman
uh can watch online if you want eh you want to watch today
ya
why
mm
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that one will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know ah movies are
just tough stuff ah because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
mmhmm
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
wah
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this uh you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by blah blah blah
mm
mm
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see ah
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
ah okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
ah but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also what
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay lah not that bad
han orh
why
okay
okay
mm
mm understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
mm I try play on Borderland lor
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
mm
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things eh like ugh
things for speedy for my cat
um
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else ah
oh I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought um
to for the mugen train I bought the demon slayer masks
I I I I I only want one which is the
nezuko one
I ordered four
of course lah but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
mmhmm
ya
adli's watching
ya
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
I feel like when everybody watches it
the special
ya
ya
uh huh
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible uh that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also ah because like
thankfully
due to the
or haikyu maybe it's gotten quite popular
it's so easy to find
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
mm
a'ah
mm
ya so that's what I'm talking about ah
hard to be a fan when they're not very
ya
mm
so like
okay understand
mmhmm
okay
oh
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
um because I don't know ah it's different ah it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
err
she's very she's very quiet lah but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun uh
how about japanese content how are they like then she's oh she doesn't actually watch a lot
there are not
as many well known
um
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
ya real dramas
um
it's not as popular lah in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so oh I just do writing because she does err makeup
like uh she studies
err what's that called cosmetics I think
um I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore lah that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
then she said oh she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it lah then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
um like during high school and all that
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian one lah because
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID ah
jakarta
ya lah
but she used to live in yoyga also yogyakarta
very nice ah they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different lah what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
ah I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
uh huh
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
kidding
um
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so um I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
in the thousands so like
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like um
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids what
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya koreaboo
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
wah I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online lah because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
um I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like wow and like it's hundred and four eh
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it um
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech eh
say it's for Logitech

ya I don't know why I've no idea lah so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there lah but you have a recommendation where
mm
mmhmm
oh
oh
mm
mm
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
mm or any of the malls around there lah
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said lah take out handphone take take the
mm
oh
that time mm ya
ya lah that one is
ah mothers' day tau I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
mm
that one I not too sure lah but you know they earn also not much
ya
err I think her mum lah her mum surely will will
uh oh
ya lah if you pay then I think cannot lah I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full lah I think if they full also it'll be
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya lor but if ya lah okay lah if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars lah then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that lah but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
mm mm
I think the rain was
oh
you stay there ya lah will damage all the property lah
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm lah
oh
mm
orh
ya lah ya lah but mm
mm
ya lah the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that lah
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
mm mm
ah
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya lah but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high lah okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
uh uh maybe ya
ya I think so
ya lah but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction lah I think when the
so ya lah you can see that actually
ya lah some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya lah if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
kan nowadays mm
mm
true ya mm
ya once in awhile jer lah
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya lor but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay lah ya lah okay lah if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
mmhmm
whenever you on the fan lah you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya lah but funny
a'ah
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe err get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya lah like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya lah
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the kan they do everything at around your what you call that
mmhmm
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people lah
okay lah but better lah like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
err can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing lah it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they err those india and china those populated countries who have like err haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
mm you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive what you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this err COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake lah ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya lah
mm ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya lah once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya mm mm
ya that's what I mean lah ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad what like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
mm
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
mm

philip is who the brother ah
public the public know
you I think you you shouldn't they shouldn't have done that what they should have done it's like you know like my meghan markel and the harry their actions speak louder eh like they just totally like you know they bo chup one then they just like they just do their own thing they donate their money to charity you know like diana was a very outspoken advocate for women's rights lah all that like she do things so people can see she's actually you know what are the rest doing I don't know they just collecting money and just sleeping on their asses ah
why they dress in german army gear what the hell

oh by the way I was reading this article you know certain times when you are sleeping at night then you hear marbles drop you know that actually had an explanation what was it ballbearings one thing and the pipe so when the the the flow the water flows through the pipe at night right it causes contraction and like ya so it mimics the sound of marbles
you know some people say eh got marble and also got doom doom doom doom upstairs when there are no kids all that even worse there are no people living upstairs do you know some guy actually posted in our yishun group seven floor corner unit it's ya it's it's haunted
actually ours also what like the kids are running up and down but I know for sure that there are a lot of kids upstairs as the weekends there there's an elderly couple upstairs
I see this I sick

you are a nuisance eh like you you you okay lah if you like look at okay uncle choo look at
if you look at uncle choo uncle choo is harmless he maybe maybe has his problem but he doesn't disturb he doesn't cause a ruckus
he already she she has problems and yet she makes it other people's problems so I think that is that's a bit much already lah
oh ya ya ya ya ya
oh the helper
ya so that means you have to stay until sunday right to make correct ah it happened with you a few a few times what ya ya
or is it just or ya
real guy is err based on a real person
because of the shiny head ah
give birth

okay
yup he is loss ya this is his fiance
so she's err engaged to him for very long already
he still in prison right ya
the thing about going out is spend money ah can ah but limit lor like can go out but err the limit spending lor cause there's there's a lot of expenses coming up so
but that's on top of your hospital stay all right ya you need to pay off your debts all
he's a he runs his own museum
are you eating it so are you hungry
I forget my my waffle is here
oh ya cyprus is in the mediterranean it's next to the it's err turkey and greece in between
that's why greece is known for the santorini right so cyprus is something like that
does turkey have beaches like this because it's right next to greece I'm assuming it has to
mm
ya so
it's a nice place I've read about it
the our master bedroom ya
mm what you want later I buy after this I buy
I you know I want I want the the err flashbacks right one says that time so ya you know you don't like to name you you maybe you will you not so impressed by the new version but I think it was good
like white mcwing eh no it's another mcwing is fresh mcflowers
chicken mccrispy ya um okay ya I can go north point later I will buy ya ya I can walk ah B I can walk there
I'm so desperate for that right I'm really going to walk there and come back
can can
maybe it's the same with us eh
when we are in a rush when you have to rush to your appointment all you you slam the door what
ya
eleven more minutes soon lah
what you want to eat after this
you want a drink I can I can look at the drink
err baileys ya koi
koi and I don't buy from koi I mine is share tea
huh
so the you know that thing is called a segway right here where you don't need to walk you just drive so the owner apparently use err
use the segway and just drove off a cliff and died ironic right your own emergent killed him
I think segway is a very err lazy way like you can walk walk ah I mean unless you are like a a person who has difficulty with physical physical task if not just walk
no peacekeeper there these people the you can see
err cyprus ah the they are they are neighbours what
orh we went when we had the car right we rented the car over there ah ya ya ya we went inside before the inside with aisyah oh really
for good
oh
on weekdays a bit hard lah
mmhmm
putri ah
the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive eh and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's err very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them uh checklist err time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time lah
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
what is your opinion on aldemir
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion ah
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very err it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king faisal the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
of what
what's on oh they watching or what
by who
the government
they're pragmatic lah ya ya
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot eh honestly
ya obviously you gonna you gonna get
don't don't eff around man in in other people countries it's not right lah you
he's not gonna get in

okay
okay
huh
ah
that's why
ah
rapatkan sangat kecuali pasal waktu kerja
mm
mm
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
consider of uh finding something else lah like what you have done which is good
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
ah consistency how you want to keep your consistent ah status
making sure that whatever you have done
ah you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like ah do something without knowing what you are doing correct ah
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon eh kevin
yes correct ah you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
huh
ah so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
you want english you want malay you want english or malay or you want korean
do they have muslim in korea
tomorrow they are coming down right to see the exhaust thing lah correct tomorrow you follow me lah help me eleven to eleven thirty
that one we settle first then number two right ah
I will bring him to see victoria you know that same place victoria
so you can assure victoria that you are also come down and check your due diligence
we left already fiona told me eh rasyidi you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost lah
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very ah
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
later I show you ah the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means ah
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
people will go there just to buy food and go away ah and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs lah
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
no the you mean the cement eh
the cement will be the second half of the unit what second half
it means it's not the for the front tau the front will be rental it would not go up huh
maybe they have to put some
they can go to the level one toilet
mm so
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
ah a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that oh the sprinkler worse ah don't need do submission
her consultancy ah the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
ah to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct
ah
ah
and I think this this few days I will shoot invite to all the
they got cash flow problem
if there's an issue then they share with us it's good for us to know correct ah of course they can deny lah but of course you you know their problem
oh actually I will get my specialist to contact you okay fine

if they want to do seventeen to be orientation then we let them do
no need to rush to rush ah we just tell them okay this is the powerpoint
this is the ah rooftop what key we going to draw out right right
ah so far so far ah so far I I have not seen them doing that
correct so safety aspect they may want us to provide them a a more secure ladder which I will get lye to quote lah
I I I think ah the new ladder doesn't matter lah correct justifiable correct
because they are our term so they need to access quarterly or as and when

but that was back
then like a few months before
um
K ya no
yes
me
I feel so attacked
no that's why that's okay so one thing that um
I think I'm defending him lah but one thing about him is that you know he takes his time you know and he doesn't he wants to date wait wait wait
in a halal way so in a halal way means right you know
ya I mean okay okay
please don't talk about him now talk about like we talk about me ya ya ya wait wait talk about me now my situation so
I am currently interview eh uh sorry ah uh please don't think um please describe yourself okay so
one thing about me right is that um I know I am still studying and I still have two years left
but then I want to work on myself
but then I still want to make friends you know even with the opposite gender just to you know ya wait just to make just you know um
just enjoy my time with them and then like there's no pressure and whatnot so with him right there's no pressure
even because I know myself I'm
even when I talk to guys or talk to my friends or whatever ah talk to people right I will take sometimes I will take hours just to reply them it's and it's not that and it's not that I am
and it's not that I am not interested it's just that I am just tired
I'm just tired I I mean I can admit that you know if I really care
I am never too busy for you but at this point of time I I acknowledge the fact that you know I I am still in that in that situation so that's why
whenever like we just talk then don't talk like that that kind of thing right I understand why
and I don't want to you know put a lot of pressure so okay so why we were talking about this even
uh I did settle for that kind of guy ah which was stupid ah bloody stupid ya I I mean no lah but then that's why so

okay okay anyway
don't be an idiot
okay you know what I'm just drill him drill eh
can meet together or not
can ah drink tea
drink tea on my patio patio patio
gape gap gap what
orh no lah he knows my family background what
no it's because he knows that I'm I'm pursuing my degree now and his academics is not
in par with me
in academic wise academic wise he's he's not there
what
how can he say how can he
think that when he's
because I think you know what
is it's ego lah you guys
the thing is about him right I don't think he has a real like really really correct like a real relationship before because right
the the the wait the ex the the ex the official ex that he was with before right cheated on him but then when I got to know how they are
during that relationship right I don't think it was
a real relationship I'm sorry lah but um
that was like during his teens lah like I think eighteen nineteen
ya that's why then after that
eighteen ya but then when I heard about the relationship right I don't think it's what
I would consider as a real relationship
I think some app
dating app
I don't know
okay so
eh wait is
is Muzmatch new
is Muzmatch new
I think so
ya
I mean I I never use before lah so I don't know
orh
fuck you okay
mm
are you talking about the girl or him
the girlfriend that cheated on him he met from Muzmatch
not really ah I mean she cheated on him after all how is that religious
because she's not over the ex before
she met hakim
like she was still friends with the ex which I think it was fucking stupid because
how can you be friends with an ex
I wouldn't say I mean we went out a few times before but we have never read as in I wouldn't I don't know okay fuck it lah you know what eh what with amin eh
I dated amin before but then now we always go out but with syafiq lah
really meh
even if even with syafiq even with syafiq
okay
once I tell once I
ya
what if what if err when I hang out wait when I hang out with syafiq and amin right because
err then I bring the guy
can ya then can what
orh
I mean ya lah I I get it but usually when I go out with syafiq
or amin right it's always both of them is not one even if
huh
me and amin no ah we are friends even though we dated each other
uh he's not
so how it ended with me and amin is that he was the one who ended it ya so
um he didn't say why but he told amin eh he told syafiq it's because like he feels that uh he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that
but then I
I don't think I acted that way eh
amin now
back then ya I was fond of him that's why I'm still friends with him
why
syafiq
syafiq I've been friends with him for more than a decade already eh
ya I mean
ya
so even
no but if if if
but is when I go out wait when I go out right it's not only like individually what is both of them
how is that weird
alah rilek ah I still single what I still enjoying my time here
ya lah then fuck it lah lose lose ah
what mm
sorry
mm mm
mm
ya I mean with amin
with amin I I think there's a possibility that we will fall out because of our history but with syafiq I don't think so lah because we were friends like way way way way way way way
ya
with amin no lah
he knows eh that I I dating around all after him
he knows he knows all about the dates that I went
we friends already we friends what because we are friends you know why cause syafiq is our mutual friend
mm so wait ah
eh I make him laugh eh funny as shit man
mm
ya
syafiq which one
mm syafiq
mm
mm
mm
okay wait wait wait how did we get to amin ah
wait amin
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
okay lah I will try lah this monday when I meet him
mm
portrait the fuck
mm
ah
uh huh
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
aiya I I give people the benefit of doubt lah
so anyway um so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump lah I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this one ah this one I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
eh no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so um the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
she doesn't want that
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and um
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said lah what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
um
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ready to settle down I think lah almost there lah but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl lah but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
mm
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason ah
ya
uh I never ask for details
mm
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really ah I no one has no one has asked me
at all
orh ya
uh huh
uh huh
mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
ah

and why
so
ya
is that your final answer
lock it in
um
I would want to be
um
I think I wanna be
iron man
it's boring but ya
because he's rich
and he has lots of gadgets
pretty cool
and he is cocky
but he's nice and cocky
I like him
ya like you know like if on netflix there's a lot of avengers movie I I just watch iron man one two three over and over again I don't know what's wrong
but ya
err
mmhmm
um got thor he's rich he owns the thunder
ya exactly
exactly
um ya um but ah you mentioned you don't like avengers what actually you like you like
superhero superhero
oo why why why
mmhmm
I watch all spiderman
but like toby maguire he's just so sad
ya he's always sad like
he's always sad like it's so hard to find him happy only towards the ending that also I find it sad
it's just naturally
it's like awkward when I when I look at him smiling
err ya
sad
ya
err ya um
any recent movies that you are in
mulan
cartoon
damn I didn't watch that
um binge any binge netflix
I know right
I love it man mm
um recently I'm more like I watch toughest prison in the world
interesting
mmhmm hmm
it's very interesting um norway
has the most luxurious oh my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage um milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know um apparently they spend one point two
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then err that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals um but err
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like um like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
um of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though um ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much ah
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ya true
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying um
err the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
vulgar ya maybe can um ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
different
because like err norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same ah philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya
mmhmm
kan
mmhmm hmm
mm
mmhmm
for black friday
no I just want to make sales I'm like I'm still thinking of mechanics
ya err
ah actually sells a lot of shit ya so she just opened a new shop the one that I share with you
ya ya ya repurpose those vintage whatever crap people will buy
um actually it has been going on for a while like actually like when I spoke
ah
um
ah they actually have a stamp at the back ya so she cover that
do the mechanics for ourselves ah to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged um someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her lah then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing ah if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn what
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya mm it's stainless steel
it's just too expensive for me I cannot ya
a'ah
mmhmm mmhmm
so not planning
to use
mmhmm
Maxi Cash Maxi Cash
per gram tau
eh ya
ya I will scare like it go higher right
no no no no
no no no that's not the way you need to the see the amount of the gram need to be lower so like if it's fifty dollar it's worth to buy and then
when the gram go higher it's to do sell
no no no no no I mean you can sell now feel free
ya you earn a lot ya so it's a bit hard
ya mmhmm
but it's for business no
mmhmm mmhmm

he's a plant hoarder
no he just buy all plants and he grows inside his room
err ya ya so he buys all those
whatever crap
he's a legit err ya I am not surprised
it exotic plants my friend exotics ya so he and then he sells ah at a higher price that's his business he earns so much more than my lashes like he can earn about seven hundred dollars per day when he has the the the one ah the plant that people wants
since it's real
I know right
which is a
a lot of resales from Carousell

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday lah ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with lah
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like uh if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment
ya so adam was supposed to
get back to me on that but he's not
no no no I

mm
mm
mm mm mm
true true true
mm
orh
mm
ya
then
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ah
mm
but um aren't you glad its holiday now
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
huh serious
I don't know
oh gosh
mm
mm
mm okay okay
mm
I forward to the
ya
whose
oh okay
oh hundred dollars
mm
you can stack
wow
I don't know
I mean like if for hotel stay
what's that
oh
interesting mm
ya so cute
um I think she wants to feeling feeling genting
has it been an hour already
stop is gonna stop

two so according to ministry of health uh we cannot have face to face interaction with um
the patients lah the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
so ya lah that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was um they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
ugh so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good um
so I mean there are different things that we
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined um
uh how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
you think so
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
oh that's very soon
ah so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff um and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families um with their expenses
next year lah next year when we can
so
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
um they bring in
ya
so
mm
mm mm
mm
okay okay okay now I understand
ah
mm
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
mm
mm ya okay
mm
ah
ah ya ya ya ya
oh okay
for the adoption drive
okay okay okay ya
ya
okay ya
okay
okay
mm
newborn okay newborn cats jer lah
like for everything
mm
has a clinic
okay
mm mm
mm
so only only donations from from people from the public
wow
ah okay ya
mm
like uh
property development uh
mm
mm mm
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
that they know
all these uh animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
mm
where are the pythons
no I don't know
mm
ya ya
no it's your skin
uh the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
hello this is art ah by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a um a a young and
really up and coming artist and
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
the lorries ya so there's
huh
uh
ah
oh okay
mm
mm okay
mm
mm
oh
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
oh I didn't know that
oh
who puts up these these signs
oh say
mm
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore uh even
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while um ya
it's just the regular birds the minahs the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
yes
mm mm
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens kan not like before
hmm
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
like different kinds of otters
okay
what is that what fan club
this is this sounds too
they're so cute they really are very cute
the ones that went to serangoon road
uh ya
okay
mm
sausage sausage
mm
I didn't know about that
is do they like
ah okay
how do they
serangoon
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
oh okay
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
mm
snakes of course
um we had our chickens and
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
mm mm mm mm
okay that's new to me
mm mm
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves kan
ah
mm
mm
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
mm

that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better lah
like I know the outro was a bit okay lah
a bit better
because the outro previously was like meh
ya
now I think intro okay lah still what my second second video
so
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that one eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together uh then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade ah
saw online like two hundred fifty sia for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it ah sia
just buy ah
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade lah as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five eh the new Ryzen four gen four eh gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
wow
then what they release it as
the fuck sia
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him lah
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company lah I guess
but okay lah it all worked out for them
free money sia
ya
Sony is terrible sia you know they don't allow discord on five I'm like what the fuck sia
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users
ya ya it's terrible eh
no the the thing is I'm like okay if you have a four chat you know but then now a lot of games support cross play and then you like
and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first one that was like quite good sia
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course uh I mean I took awhile before I went to discord
whatever it is better than Razer comms man Razer comms was shit man
that fiasco I remember sia it ate up so much RAM everything lag
ya
not all
like
ya
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
eh for the life
ya like you know you go overseas you know and then like people pay then you take out the Razer card then you like eh my one got bro bro
ya
ya
ya
Razer is like so diverse is nonsensical
and then you have like the old models and then new models and then they all look kind of the same
it's like the worse sia it's like it's like err it's like err
ya it's just ya
ya
now then the people who don't know they buy the old one they got scam and then they like oo I thought this was the new one ah shit
then you like oh too bad you suck
ah ya
but okay lah
I only just want the only that's it
with
right
oh
uh huh
cannot drink coffee
chill
play some phone games
I mean it is what it is
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
oh ya
get paid already
but that's the point what leave in a big company you get paid what
unless take unpaid there is no unpaid there is
oh ya
or you take more leave then you should have because I think you cannot lah you
ya
take leave also go where
ya
ya
there you go
there I tell you already doesn't matter
oh ya
ya that's the sucky part about transport allowance
like my transport experience you have to use for anything sia
ya
mmhmm
non-physical money
digital token
okay ah you pass pass ah pass pass to your friends
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
aww fuck man
tracking system you track yourself or the or what
for what sia
oh
all the time ah
but your your work ask you to travel meh I thought you just watch cameras
ya that's the thing
ah
salary ya
but
but there's always a but
anyways
ya
and but for your case cannot ah sia
ya you just stuck
ya
ya
nearby ah orh
oh fuck
that sucks
but okay ah it's a it's a it's a convenience but it kinda sucks sometimes
ya
doing oops ya
ya
then cannot eat ah
ya
but okay lah at least you can eat after before where is free it during when it's not free eat after before is like not
no choice lah
no during the best because you get paid for eating
get paid for eating bro
oh
ya
nowadays nowhere ah
ya in town no ah
ya sia
ya usually it's four dollars five four fifty
ya especially nowadays ah
uh COVID
COVID sucks balls
ya
ya
ya eh zero cases locally transmitted today I think and twelve
twelve day twelve twelve from ah overseas
zero ya
I think yesterday was two
yesterday was two
ya
at a very low number
they say what end of the year what
end of the year phase three blah blah blah
ya
can what now bangkok open what but then you have to stay there ninety days
oh same eh
oh really
why
oh
no wonder I was being seeing a lot of my friends in photos at australia so he went ah you can go
you can go ah
ya lah for travel ah
we are open to going but then
but then when they come when they come back they have to also lah
ya lah swab test is under no confirm got one all
ya lah
I think when you drop down ah
I know I'm not really sure lah I have to check
it's a lot lah fuck
payment lah fine
token sum
fuck
oh
because you like like considered like you increase the risk of COVID spreading is it in australia I mean australia got a lot of weird environmental laws lah
ya
australian or singapore
australian is
you know at singapore currency is stronger than australia now
after very long no
now is like their three thousand is two thousand plus
or what
ya I think
ninety cents around there ya that means means ours is stronger I'm actually surprised I remember last time people were like go australia one point four
then the currency drop like shit
no now the best place to go new zealand they don't need wear mask anymore
but then it's like
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week oh ya oh that means it really surged sia wah
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only sia
oh my god
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya lah
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like siao lah
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage eh only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck ah
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
ya
the because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money ah then then but but that is unlikely ah
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like ah you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late ah can got late payment ah
but there's no interest lah
ya
you know the new borat movie coming out soon borat
and then there's this video of uh donald trump's lawyer rudy giuliani
so the thing is right he was ah asked to come to the bed ah the hotel room of the borat borat two got borat and his daughter I think
so the daughter of borat supposedly lah ask him to come to the room and shit lah
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever lah so then he put borat put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
ah so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room ah then he was in the room ah then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the borat came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen ah she was twenty four lah but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is oh he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet ah but a few people in the media industry watched it ah like I because borat does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week lah next week monday most likely the video goes public ah
ah no they he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad ah
borat does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer ah the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video sia come on guys
no ah they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
why
why sia
haiya they I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
taiwan ah
the missile lah
taiwan ah
this is how countries do diplomacy lah
same like north korea what
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions lah it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over taiwan then it says taiwan wasn't theirs in the first place
the only sad part is actually taiwan defeated not defeated lah kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
because china is
ya ya taiwan isn't listed as a country of the because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china and a few other countries
republic of taiwan no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news ah
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between taiwan and singapore is that we are not under another country
ha ha ha ha ha ha
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean hey are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like eh eh boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't have you seen the video
and then now cannot go back home
ah so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because lockdown back
then I was like uh
oh okay
why ah then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think sabah had err election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like oh that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread lah I guess
I don't know lah difficult lah the policies they have also not very strong so
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to lor
to like buy stuff buy fuel
a'ah sia
eh come on ah it's one third the price bro that means eh I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time ah jer per week sia that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only sia instead of times three ah two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time mah you travel there ah
every month eh
but okay lah takes a lot of time ah I personally don't do it because
jam ah
always jam
and then the closest one near tuas and then tuas you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
but okay what ah now got the discount what twenty percent sia for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is ah if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions lah okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight ah I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line
fuck you lah no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
ha ha ha
no expediting the process is donald trump man
very sad like he worked eight years sia for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like sial ah you all talk about emails ivanka also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know lah
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best sia to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really ah guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter eh bro
ya
now he still now he still
and first ladies ah
like melania trump nobody cares ah
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I uh I really don't care
who
valkrae
oh ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya alexandria ocasio-cortez ya she she was the highest the most viewed stream on twitch sia the most viewed stream I was like oh wow but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really sia she's really good sia and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan eh like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also ah bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say ah aggressive a lot of people don't like her
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like oh she's too progressive
oh err reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering lah begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
is one point two K every week eh
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same ah it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything ah he's not gonna like oh let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
oh my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like ah the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct oh my god I was like ugh and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
world sia
never right
kan ah
any proof ah I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview ah like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things ah
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation lah the questions ah then after that he got
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes ah like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
kan
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible ah
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible ah that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
so how how's your job you know like ah do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like aww man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn ah like this moneylenders
like other crap lah that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same ah
but like this ah
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses lah
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a it is govern by the government lah so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard lah
they are not going to closed down and the like oh no more public transport for singapore
ya but
ya sia
oh
period who go out not a lot sia
ya
work essential service not relays
but sad ah sad some of the really but lucky they got some subsidies and like you know
they had
not all lah
ya rental ah
two months I think two months I think
ah
my my neighbour taxi driver
he say ah work then he earn the pay the fuel then the rest of the money I keep then okay he camps around ah airport you know
because they don't have to pay rent
ya

but rarely lah
like ten minute wait lah
okay ah
I mean
shopping centre ah
huh then what the fuck sia
call pe
fuck
ya
I think confirm sleep
happens ah happens I got that time delivery also I got do at home right
but mine is collecting food so it's not not really at most you just come
at most I just come I I that time usually I I deliver one hour sia
after I get the order
I wake up then like slowly go to the bike
the thing is the person is waiting at home it doesn't matter
then the food the food doesn't they don't care how long they wait they don't have a say in it ah ah most to most the customer complain
most of the time they won't ah they might but so far my experience is no
then you chao
ya
but
ha ha ha ha ha ha
woke up into what about currently
you got burned bro
so he wanted the guy come down then was like I'm gonna eat your pizza mate you gotta come down here I'm gonna I'm gonna eat right here
ya
actually by right if got staircase then we cannot deliver up sometime a bit nonsense one
like
if it's like if you allow like like go up staircase like if it's one two floors is fine then if it's more than what if it's an old guy kind of like a bit busted to him also eh
ya that's the thing ah then it's like busted what then you have to come down it it protects riders more ah
if there's a lift you really got really no excuse ah
buildings don't have
I hate sia that one and then usually right the people who order live on the fifth floor
fucking assholes man
and then don't want come down
don't want
send to my door
yup
but it is what it is
it is what it is
wah sial lah that one I remember sia
that was the worst I didn't go supermarket
I was like fuck that shit
I guess sceptical help lah
ya
I remember during that period I went like
at like two to the grocery store
because no one is awake right
so it's like lesser people to fight with
but then the thing
they restocking around that period as well
ya
then got nothing for you
ya
ya
that's why ah
no lah mine got more mine got three or four three or four no mine cause it's twenty four hours
but mine they do the restocking at that time so cannot be two person what
the store quite big sia mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
ya
ah ya
ya that's the thing ah
ah okay
put the money then go jer
ha ha ha ha
scan yourself you know like
then you just go fuck off
okay what
ya what you doing ah what you doing I'm paying for my own groceries
why never ring the bell cause I lazy bro
the starting lah
one point five
no the thing is singapore water can drink sia the tap
and COVID is not waterborne
it was proven not to be waterborne that's why they said swimming pools were safe
ya I guess I guess so
but there is still ah you know
not all ah but a lot of them ah
oh ya
which is
that's why ah WhatsApp group dangerous
all this fake news
I I never really like
like some people just join sia random WhatsApp group you know like
the fuck sia
I don't know that's the thing
it doesn't make sense
but I guess that's where like they get their info that's the thing ah the info not verified also
I can just send some random shit that I made
one thing at least singapore give free mask okay ah
I feel the free mask initiative was quite good
two time oh ya ya ya okay ah not bad

yes
err I'm fine thank you
ya
um I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about um
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me um
ugh
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like err couple
ah redirected to me and then like I I I ask lah hi sir how may I help you
um and so err
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
at your you're risking yourself lah to exposure to virus so
no eating in the store at all you know
rude lah so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like um like we don't have a like um like we are like lower than them
correct ya so err
ya then the day before it was quite funny because um there was this err couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in hey but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then um ya so they were they came in and
err I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like hey why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like err she was like oh like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
mmhmm
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time ah they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards um crane operators err tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
mm mm
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
mmhmm
wah that is late
mm
my alarm lah oh my god
you know that's a typical um an err reaction from old people the audience be like
your mum's friend
okay
mm
mm
mmhmm
correct
mm
aduh
mm mm
that is right
correct
mm
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
mm
mm
alhamdulillah
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share lah we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you lah as of now lah
ya because like I mean like for
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes lah like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like um I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it lah in terms of like
like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not um
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before lah like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like oh my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and um
um for me because um
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home lah which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of err
ya correct mm and then like
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
like you you figure your shit out lah
my mum know lah that he doesn't work lah
that's why she divorce him lah
you know
when I was in err primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long um
since I was in primary two ah I don't know eight years old um now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no lah she remarried and then um she divorced when I was in ya
mm
ya then like alhamdulillah like long time lah but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family lah and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said eh err I'm going to I'm going to the food court lah to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and um
and like he's working
sometimes I really like
like just err pray to god lah alhamdulillah my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know err one funny day err my youngest sister told me she's like
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
when I was working my full time job lah I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so um ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that lah
was to like maybe set up a mm maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him lah even though because at one time lah they wanted to divorce then we we advise them lah like as the older children we advise them to stay together lah if they if they can
why are we born in a poor family
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those err chinese people in society where they say oh I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
um on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
mm
ya so ya I mean I'm
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better lah or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
mm which one the the guy ah
ya that bastard
that is true
ya but like um so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like err what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it lah until the time is up ah
book smart lah
mm
mm
correct
mm
mmhmm
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
mm
mm
mm
it is
mmhmm
ya it's so fast right your time like oh my god
mm
mm
mm
mm
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where um a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like oh I convert
of course
mm
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
mm
oh
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl
ya
ah of course knowing you you would have dressed up
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
ya is your acts right
mm
mm
correct
mm
that's great internship in singapore
mm

okay
I was in the I was doing err project management in their construction line lah
ah
yes
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response lah
and the
ah ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times lah so
then err
err when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
it was just a job for me
uh it's just a job for me to pay the bills lah
and ah just to
to to to earn to earn money lah
most of them they further their studies
ah
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay ah just go go go ahead with it
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree uh which
is related to my work lah so err maybe err err few years down the road err
down my career path lah in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
oh okay err I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up uh civil engineering ya ah
err
it it it
err
it's related lah but
uh not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the err engineering aspect ah it's more to the project management side
it was just like ah
ya
so ah
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now lah
even before during my poly I went for my err internship
so it was during my internship that that made me err think twice to to join the construction industry
err it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
ah
the working hours the nature of the work uh the work environment
err err ya
err
just sharing my my my experiences lah
okay okay mm
ya they attach me to a local construction company
err so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries lah or you can see a big difference between a local company and err err foreign or multinational company lah
I err in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that lah so I was attached to a local construction company lah
ah the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a ah
a
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
acknowledge
in their office ya that was that was how I felt lah
it's a it's a foreigner I think ah he he's an indian guy
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy
ah
so ah
he was the first guy who acknowledged me
ah
abeh ah
the project manager err then the project manager
on that day on that day ah
uh I think every every everywhere you work lah every month they will have a progress meeting ah
so the
so
ah okay for now you
you just follow my engineer
these big drawings construction drawings
err the size
this ah project lah
so
that that repeated for maybe two or three days ah
who who was was I was supposed to
to follow
so okay lah and then
he literally
ya ya I am ah
ya err
I'm I'm the I'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
ah so ya
the only
err the higher up
once a month ah just for the meeting ah just for the progress meeting mm
ah ya ya
so ya then err that that was it lah
it's like maybe err five five workers five staff or five to six ah mm
he's from uh
ya
ah ah ah
so ah and ah this ah
organisation he he he is a student from this err organisation ah
err
err the the students from china during the err
try try to
err like err
mm
uh
what um what's the
ah ya ya ya ah
err err like
ah language barrier and
err in in his own world lah
err err
ah ya office hours ah
stay back at work sia
then
only then you understand
what he meant ah which is true ah which is true ah ah ya ya
this industry like this is the work environment that I'm gonna be in
err
err wasted kan
err in this industry just just to just to have a job ah just to have a job and just help out help out the
uh pay the bills have part of the family ya which I which I did lah then
err
this thing
there were also doubt in my mind lah
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages ah it's not it's it's no longer
err that time was like what
early twenties lah kan early twenties
then you literally work your way up ah
but at that point
didn't didn't thought had that in mind lah
ya so
err
ah like
and it also ah
you need to have some technical knowledge lah which I was lacking ah
err with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking ah
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad ah
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas lah
so
ah
oh okay
mm ya ya
so ya err
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
ah consultants usually they provide the technical err aspect ah
so err when when when whenever you
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
what I
what was more on the soft skills
but
ah when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it lah
ah
a a
a degree lah then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
err previously was unisim now they call it ah
ya so
then you decided not to
okay ah
good for you lah good for you I mean
ah ya so
I took up
err my part-time degree
oh everyones
at that time ya like
really take up a degree in what really interest you ah
mm mm
ya
in the industry because your industry uh
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
uh with the the the
bosses like
doing this long term
like ah so like
uh we are a big
and then they got their directors lah and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy ah
like sometimes the conflict like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally ah living a comfortable life ah
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to
under production ah
under it's under ah
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa time is like you you will feel the time pressure lah
like you are running out of time ah so
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
we are are we
pick up another three years of study
at that time was
was so was want to
ah there's this
err
it's called a ah
and then the new zealand err working holiday is is a visa lah basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
err the visa is for six months
err
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
uh is that horticulture industry lah
reservist dah approve
the more money I have can save up the more money
so this early this year when COVID everything happen eh like
only god knows what I was feeling ah at that time like
oh singapore at at first
ah ah at first
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders
so like
for the first two months like that one
ah april ah
yes yes uh huh
at that time when when the the the
the news was was at at its height eh like
got diagnosed positive COVID positive ah and she was seated like ah three
three or four tables behind me which is
you have a lot of things planned already eh any like for everything to come crashing down eh it's really disappointing ah ah but
err at that time we just ah
ya but then err then
after that things happen

actually it's true lah actually mac can last quite long if you take care of it properly
it's so expensive but then they only last for a long time eh for a short time
I mean like I feel like that's like
one of the things no meh but like
it's just not high class ya ya ya it's so like when you think of windows you think of cheap plastic square boxy like
androids couldn't beat me lah it's just what I would say

I miss travelling lah
it's like is the is like it's the end of okay because um
I have this
holiday destination where I want to go to
like last year we went to australia that previous year was europe and then this year
there was no there's nowhere to go
the cruise ya the cruise
so
ya it have always been Airbnb okay
Airbnb where you get where you get comfy bay you get comfy pillow comfy
toilet comfy kitchen hall living room oh my god ah that is so nice and we don't have to go far lah we just
all we want is just maybe to go to our neighbouring country you know like malaysia
err I I'm not sure because I don't think they have like us safe entry or maybe trace together
and um I'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then um
because johor has err strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because err the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if johor um numbers demote back ah but I think after a week it does in its red zone
mm
ya I still have my dirt bike to go oh my god
ya it's on the date it was it's on the day that
err the government of malaysia actually wanted to close down the borders
I was like oh my god
I I paid two hundred sing dollars for the dirt bike you know
I didn't even get to go and I was like should I and and we were like should we go
we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the the the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then I think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
err ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve you see ya just say twelve so
I was texting I was texting the dirt bike organiser I was like hey I get this um news about your government closing down the borders blah blah so how how is it now then she says that okay
err we will put aside your name and all those stuff so once everything get back
to normal and all those stuff and then you know
um she she will email us and we have to confirm the date in within six months so I'm like okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm or their business may flop you see
ya I saw like um
the europe
country is new zealand and I don't know which other country allow the singapore is allow certain countries okay example one of it is our country lah singapore to actually go over there without having to um
isolate ourselves lah but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks
so I'm like and the cases in europe ah
you know higher
ya actually lah because it's like you know
mm
mm mm mm mm
I think this is the err this is worse than SARS man
ah okay lah that's nonsense lah we all know that's nonsense you see
ya there are some like you know they are being hospitalised for a month or so like six months three months four months and some are in
so it's like if it were to be that easy I don't think any other countries will have second lockdown you know
that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
um we are having this thing we call circuit circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask
mm
mm
mm
flexible lah mm
lenient ah lenient
mm
mm mm
mm
mm
mm

mm
ya
mm mm
ya lah correct
both
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
mmhmm
ya
we'll be back as how we used to be I mean
I mean we
even though I mean I believe there are some people that you know even though they says that five or ten people that are allowed in your home there's like
and then like your recent family gathering you know like uh
you just have to hush hush so that you know your neighbours won't know about it and all those stuff
so it's a sad thing lah that what we used to do you can't now so ya and and then they're and then
ya I mean we're so used to having two thousand people coming down for your wedding but then now is like
it used to be five and then ten then fifty now two hundred but I think still
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm correct
correct ya
mm
ya correct
ya
correct correct
ya
err
so I think it's it's a very difficult it's a very difficult time lah for for
for everyone lah ya
but then but then again I eh ya ya it's chaos but I
ya
mm
now is not the time lah ya
correct ya
correct
correct ya ya that's true
ya ya that's true that's true
it's um
mmhmm
ah
ya
ya
you know when I was climbing the stairs ah I
pull down my mask a little bit you know
because I'm I'm like stuck stuck ya
I feel I'm breathless
ya
I'm like breathless climbing the stairs is like oh my goodness I need to I need to lift down my mask a little bit and breathe sis like err
ya
affect their
ya mentally is affecting them as well lah
ya
YouTube ya
correct correct
ya and they can spend the whole day okay
ya correct correct mengeteh eh mengeteh
ya
ya ya ya correct
ya
millennial you know like those that were born in the what fifties
ya
nineteen forties nineteen fifties sia
ya ya ya
mm
and then like what I see my dad is doing right now is like other than going out he would just on his YouTube on his um me watch
mm
ya a lot of strolling lah but then um
kamal adli
four minute left
ah
mm mm
mmhmm twenty five dollar twenty five dollar eh
mm
I ain't doing this man
mmhmm
two

mmhmm
ah ya ya ya I remember her
mmhmm
oh really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
mm I'm not so sure I think you can do some uh admin job duties I know in my workplace uh sometimes we have um we need we get orders from customers for bentos or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to uh hire someone for the time being especially during this period lah
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
mm I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay hijabis not uh not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this um poll lah uh asking whether like have any of us malay hijabis ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset lah like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
oh
mm
wah
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry uh for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab err restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried oh let's say what if the medicine or anything like
and I think in social media it has been blowing up ah but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay lah ha
aww
it's not fated man
what
there's better men out there so don't worry about him
why
ya
err what what what does that guy do is he working or studying or
oh

mm
what
oh really shell out
ya I don't
mm
mm
mm
um
mm
ya that's true
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
how much was your kurta
okay
still okay
mm
ya
escalator escalator
ya
so I had to win that game
mm
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games err and this just brought me back to
early times ah I guess
mm
um the game of life is basically
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
and then there was
mm
pick up sticks
ya
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
so
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
mm
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then eh ya
oh ya ya ya
mm
I
oh congkak yes
ah but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
congkak yes I actually really like congkak
okay
where it's like a kampung where it's design and and like err painted in a way that looks like a kampung so there was like hopscotch on the floor there were games here and there
ya err ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands lah so
mm
ya ya
mm
mm ya something like that ya ya ya mm
yes yes that one is like the spider spider plastic spider
ya that one never play before
the ya
how
okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya oh my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
mm
mm
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working ah full time right now um in an office I work in an office job for a business school
um so I'm just giving you a bit of context lah eh um I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's err and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
the company
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that err sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
but I think for now no lah
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business eh
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already um on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
um like her story
ah okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
my number one idol when it comes to business
err I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
err ya ya fenty fenty became
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya oh no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable lah so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products ah like companies that she made
like gave her so much respect in that
like err area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then um she also has
err like a luxury line which I forgot ah I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're wow this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business mm
I I think what success is
is like maybe lah for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
like I think to me that is success
mm mm
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
ya go ahead
yes
mm
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so um
um the account was giving seventy K seventy K
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus err the iphone new iphone
I
oh I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to err to um settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
wow fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty mm
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
mmhmm
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there lah but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell lah
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why ah you you ask me that before
mmhmm
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach ah and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
mm
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like oh I can afford this you know like so it comes with it lah
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
mm
mm mm
okay sure
mm
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
ah the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine
hmm
I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours
ya and we don't know if they are getting paid much more
ya in a in a in a way yes
go frontliners shout out
mm
you not actually nurse
I think you can
I think you will make a good nurse
I think you can
can you
no let's not talk about that but I don't have lah
okay
wait I wanted to share something but I think that's not best to be shared okay nevermind moving forward
mm nurse eh maybe maybe I don't think I would good news
ya true
do they have to go to medical school
to be a doctor
I don't know
wait what are we doing with our lives I think it's
doctorate lah
doctorate degree
mm
doctor fazil
doctorate
and doctorate is like
ya then he make fun of the people there early on he he's like he's like err
I believe there are some err owners here as well how you all get in this one have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further lah I don't know
like we generally don't know okay we're sorry but
general practitioner wow
ah ah
ya
ya ya ya ya
wah bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya like
err okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a err not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor banu doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
mm game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice
singlish err it's not that fun lah
it's okay lah
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
nice
oh well you manipulated me
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward err ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
um
no
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
mm food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
mm
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but um ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya lah we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference aww but err I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person ah but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
um like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like um
maybe some like close friends as well so
that
stress ah to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders ah it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and err
mmhmm
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
probably would put you in check a bit more
err but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
err I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you um sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya
thanks thank you

ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
ya
uh because the thing is like uh when I first saw the trailer
I was quite behind the hype already lah in a way
ya
um
orh okay
ya because uh
when I started uh I think I don't know how like err I was in cause I think um a lot of people watch already but ah even then when I watch later the hype was still there so err the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so uh I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the manga eh I I'm gonna read the manga sorry not watch ya but it was really good lah ya
mm
then it ended
orh september
oh ah ah
ah
oh one shot ah
rise up ah ya
ya
mm mm
naruto
ah
mm
ya
ah um avengers endgame ah
very rare so I was blown away ah
ah no lah ya ya
mm mm
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when uh nezuko and tanjiro killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off what it's such a coward move but gui is just
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
mm
blow me away it's okay
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
uh I think that's the main ah unique point of ah demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
mm
correct correct
mm
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
mm
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that uh um
one piece eh uh because uh naruto the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
oh
mm mm
ya
mm
orh short film
mm
ya
ah
pe
ya ya ya
mm
mm
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
uh bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science one science is programing ah ya
ya
mm
mm
that's why
ya ah the the velocity part I think
ah
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
mm
mm
oh
mm famous ah ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
mm
mm
correct
mmhmm
ya ya correct
mm
mm mm
ya
ya
when I started
mm
mm mm
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
people think like you don't do your err revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is ah sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
mm
ya
oh this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
mm
mm
mm
oh okay okay
mm
ya ya correct correct
mm
ya
uh ya ya ya ya ya
but it depends on the person itself lah but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice ah ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
ya
ya
ah
ah
mm
correct correct
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best lah cause over time like you have to
um adapt ah I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
uh
err for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest ah this one I haven't share with you before uh so um
I kind of err didn't sit for my paper
ya so err this news right I'm just telling you this um okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that um if you don't sit for your paper
and then uh if you have err I think the requirement for the assignments is like err forty percent and above that means your over ah there are two components uh assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without err redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod ah so
for me
okay lah for me since I'm new to it lah like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
ya
orh
oh
like like
oh range oh okay okay okay
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to lah cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right oh for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different ah assignments and projects ya so because your school is uh assignment and project based my one is ah exam so that's the thing you all also have err
intermittent exams right
math oh my goodness
don't have err
uh not exactly math but I think err since your mum is a english teacher she should know also err there's this thing called err phonetics and um what is it under ah it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like um if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
um put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a um sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part lah
uh
there is one ya ya there is uh the uh what mod I took I think they taught us about err there are some similarities uh between err varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
mm
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
um ya lah because essentially
err they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office sia
oh ya but okay lah uh that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about err
language and society like how people use language and all that that one is more to um
I would say uh you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how ah different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
ah dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's uh in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of err analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now eh I wish I I don't have to take is uh literature
but they rebrand it so like no choice ah I just stayed ah cause I have to defer for err one semester

because it's quite mentally draining tau if you set the bar too high so you must slowly find the small things that make you happy lah ya and and I heard this phrase before like um
uh sometimes the things that makes us the happiest right doesn't require money ah
ya that's that's that's the most priceless thing that that that that is a golden code lah
correct correct
ya
ya
because they are tuned to it ah
mm
yes

you're satisfied ah ya correct correct yes yes

correct ah
mm
ya
correct correct it's like uh it's like an experience uh like um err it takes you on a ride I guess like uh
ride off
what what am I trying to say like roller coaster in motion ah sorry sorry I can't get my thoughts right so it's a it's a good thing like it like it's a temporary escape from reality and like uh you get to experience something and then you just move on in your life ah is

mm mm yes yes yes
ya
orh yes yes yes
ya
ya correct
ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
mm
ya
ya
correct uh there's one prime example uh I think is everyone's favourite
wait is he is not right ah Marvel cinematic universe ah iron man ah he don't have any powers but like he he's uh drive to make the world a better place and too um I think in age of ultron he said he want to like uh have a iron barrier around earth uh to like sort of protect lah but um even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like uh protect what's what matters to him the most ah so like um
get the power from your own uh
err
his ability to uh be a genius
and like uh construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it lah like people always look at the uh powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
uh thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right ah and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes ah and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
I think she was like err um
uh assassin or some sort then she got um err close combat err training and iron man is just err a man with a suit lah but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite err touching ah if you think about it no power tau
mm
ya
correct
yes
mm
mm
ya ya
ya
mm
it motivates you ah in a way
ya
mm mm
mm
ya
higher
mm
mm
mm
mm
yes
mm
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya
mm
mm
ya
ya
it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people ah
mm
yes
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice um
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now ah eh I'm working part time lah ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry ah but my job got suspended because of COVID so like err I cannot work for the meantime so um I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy ah but it's you're on the right track ah so it is relevant lah it's a good thing
mm mm
mm mm
ya
mm
ya ya ya
mm
mm
ya
yes
ya
ya
so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the err pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
ya
ya
yes
ya
correct
ya
mm
ya
ah
ya you need to um get the answer and then like you have to analyse it and then like tune it in a way that it suits your current situation
ya ya
ya ya
ah
mm
mm
tip top ah
nobody want to play ya ya ya correct correct
mm
ya

mm

ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
element eh
and in it's an ingredient for you to
mm
ya
it's very useful
ya
ya
ya
but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like err I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering uh the zero gravity there is quite uh
quite intense ah so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve uh being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something ah
ya cause if he want to be married eh buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
that's why
ya
it's another planet
ya
mm
mm
moon burger
ya ya ya
space Grab
ya but how many light years away is mars ah
I never thought about it eh
ya
oh it's not light years
years
oh but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough eh
I don't know how they do it sia seriously
ya ya ya correct
err ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive ah then you wouldn't die ah
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
mm
ya
correct correct
ya
mm mm
that's right
ya ya ya
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress ah then like you just stay stagnant ah like uh because it's not affecting you what and that's the thing about humans lah like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
change ah the ah sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change ah but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the manga or the watch the uh talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of um
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph ah
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
mm
mm
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
mm
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to err
is bangkok the correct word like a way to um set the bar like I I err do as an inspiration ah in a way
ya
so that's the good thing
mm
undertaker
yes oh my god my favourite wrestler then he retire
mm
ya
ya
impact
ah diego maradona
that's quite sad ah
ah ya
mm
ya
I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb eh I guess ah when people pass on they look at the good things ah and they try to overlook the uh bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
um his negative aspects um err
even though they were quite drastic but uh the achievements overshadow that ah but in the end when everyone passes on right is um
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them ah recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper um
what's the word eh passing eh no um ah final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status err for awhile then like um at least you um go in peace ah like ya you don't feel like oh um
there's anything left
ah ya ya ya you you feel like err a burden off your shoulder ah in a way
what's why
mm
making one of the best anime
oh my goodness
ya
mm
that's why it's amazing how this um shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right
ya
okay
uh

oh okay
that's the part where we decide if we should get out or not right
yes
yes
hais
why don't you go first
mmhmm
yes the bunny chow
uh huh
yes
ya and I feel like it was a new experience in terms of how they presented it
a full loaf of bread and the top is cut
like like a like a hat it's like a hat like you take off the top
and then a pool of curry inside so it's like basically a loaf of bread with a hole inside and it's just curry
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
a'ah
yes yes
and it was a it was a weekday it was a normal weekday working day kind of thing
mm mm mm
yes we were very hungry
ya
ya and then I feel it's also the the service
yes we did but it was it was a day of of trying food it was a it was a food adventure day ya
yes
oh okay okay ya we tried the
steelers I think it was a local
burger joint but it was a
fast food
burger joint
ya
yes
and uh that was quite nice also
I felt
like not like basically not healthy you know what I mean like you can tell it's not a proper meal you know like I shouldn't be eating this that kind of thing
ya
I forgot but but it it didn't it didn't stay in my mind cause after that we tried steelers and I was like wow a whole new experience ya
ya
yes
not spicy
ya not not up to our standards our tongues
ya
just just another day
yes we did we did
ya our our spice game was
was really showing on during that trip like we really felt it
ya
ya so after that we tried steelers and that was good what else did we try that day or did we call it a day afterwards
I think we also went to this err the cake malay restaurant right cause they they have the in in
south africa they have their own malay community
ah so we went over there and tried
but I forgot what exactly did we try do you remember
ah
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
ah
uh huh
I think two three years
oh god
a'ah ah ah ah
ya
mm was a thing it was a mixture of things
but it was interesting also
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's a different history and everything lah
different background
ya ya ya
mmhmm but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
is it prata
ya
uh huh uh huh
ya ya ya
wow
oh my god bo-kaap okay ya
uh huh
what does it look like
is it like a pani is it like
is it like Subway is it
ya I think I think the memories are coming back okay ya
it was basically like
loaded in every ways
ah
ya
did we keep it for another day I feel like ya
oh gosh
oh shit
LOL
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya ya that was too much for me cause ya
I remember eventually I was picking it apart like
ya ya
ya
ya ya ya
yes yes cause they couldn't
ya
ya
and that that was really what it felt like what if if anyone out there wants to know how it tastes it's rich
uh huh uh huh ya ya
ah ya the gatsby ya that's what it's called ya
gosh
we ate a lot of ya
yes
feel like that whole trip was a it was a whole lot of trial and error and just pure excitement on our part but at the end of the day it was a it was a great experience
we didn't do anything stupid that's the good thing
I mean it we did a lot of stupid things but nothing regrettable okay you know nothing like I go back and I'm like oh what did I do you know it was just oh we did a lot of weird stuff I guess
oh shit that was stupid
ah
a'ah
mmhmm
a'ah
we are
ya ya ya
yup
mm
brain not functioning
mmhmm
yes
yes
forgot man
oh okay okay
ya ya ya
it was a bit weird but okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm mm
mmhmm
a'ah
a'ah
a'ah
mmhmm
mm mm mm
a'ah
ah
ah
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
yes
yes
you know right
oh it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go bukit timah hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
ah
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot
yes
ah
yes there there was five three G or four G I remember
ya
ya
mmhmm
yes
we
ah
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
ah a'ah
oh
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
kan that was an experience friend
mm
lion uh huh
a'ah
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
ah I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
wah
ya we went quite ya damn early
mm mm
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
oh we haven't went
cause I I like
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero
gosh
with a whole new list
like the other day I was talking to her her name is amisyah and she's like I was like amisyah I really feel that we go somewhere it's for you ya I feel like you will enjoy it as much as I think and then she's like I did thought about it and I feel like I belong
and I'm like okay put it in the to-do list okay
before we die
yes
but my my friend has a stable job so it's just me lah which is fine
huh
oh wah that was really an experience man
I was telling her about how you how we had one day specifically just to visit all the mosques
yes
I'm like natasha we will visit all the mosques
okay no ya I know as in
I was completely I don't mind it's just like I just telling her
eh do you know or not I actually visit the mosques one by one that was like the most holiest thing I've ever done in my life
I think
oh gosh
ya it was also quite near to one another ya
ya
ya and I feel like during the experience err
while walking we also sort of explored the region a lot yes I felt I felt it was a good tour
yes
like I felt there was also another another good experience though ah ya
ya we did walking tour
we backed out
ya cause we felt like we didn't we feel like what ah I feel like the guy did
did a lot of stuff it's just that I could have gotten information online
it wasn't I feel like I wasn't it wasn't adding value to my things I've already read up on the usual so ya
oh gosh I don't remember mm
ya
oh gosh that was a lot of experience
food wise in terms of like which part the safari
ya
three weeks it was like three weeks but the three weeks we felt like packed so much information didn't feel like three weeks we felt like more than
ya it felt so long
a'ah
uh
ya
ya and then ya and then the weekend trip the the field trip is like forever you know they tell you we going on a field trip
takes like three hours to get there it was it's a completely different town
that kind of thing cause it's a big country but ya
ya ya
the field trip is like it's like hi we're going to the beach then like in singapore if I say to that you think of like east coast park over over there is like we're going to the beach and there are
actual penguins at the beach
like it was whole new thing
that ya
like I feel like whoever planned that whole school summer program really deserve a raise man
yes yes but I feel like it was money well-spent
american ya
ya ya ya ya
a'ah a'ah a'ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes
ya
ya ya ya
ya
a lot of seafood lah I remember seafood
ya
ya we were at the coast a lot I remember one time there was a there was the ostrich
that ostrich
farm okay we were at the ostrich farm okay so we knew very well that the ostrich came from breeding purposes like it wasn't a random ostrich shop down the road kind of thing
you know ya
yes
ya
but ya and then we had what else
a'ah
mm
I don't okay not puberty you know when you're eighteen you do a lot of stupid shit it's like that ya like like that part where you
think that you are mature but you are not actually mature you know
ya ya ya
ya
different school but we can trust them cause same land
yes
mm
mmhmm
yes
mm mm mm
yes
mmhmm
ah
ah ya avoid like we try to keep a distance ya
to spend time with him especially for activities that he need to pair up
a good trip for everyone and I feel like that was that was a good move on all our parts you know
cause I feel like even though the boy like
I mean
ya it's a bit questionable but I mean whatever lah ah after that we didn't keep in touch so whatever
it's okay we we did our part we did our our community service for the day community service
I feel like
I feel like we did good you know
like it's like eh
it's like it's a it's a good looking back wow matured
are you serious
but ya that was a really really fun trip I feel
mmhmm
oh gosh the kayaking
ya I remember I was I was really genuinely scared for my life
like I I really could have a panic attack if he just
uh gosh ya
um
the cave
the cave
your favourite
is it what you talk
uh huh
ya ya ya
ya
you guess that
ya ya ya
god damn it
hais
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip lah if I had to look back at the things that I've uh did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
I want to learn how to draw
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
it's a certain skill lah that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level ah
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
err art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my uh colouring skills
cause that's also uh colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
mmhmm
what about you
just one ah
can
oh wow
yes that's the way
okay
I ah I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
wow
a'ah
oh wow
kind of what
okay
uh huh ah
ya it will
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh yes
did they die
oh gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so uh what else
two more skills
for me um other than drawing
mm
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember ah my dear friend wen xing were walking at this
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
oh shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak eh and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming lah ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point ah
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think wah it's like wow this girl really spend a lot of money to go krabi when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to krabi
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical uh suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her eh I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like eh shit she got kidnapped I die sia
seven like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like uh if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping lah so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have lah but ya I also like uh and then my friend was also uh
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in krabi there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then err this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
nadi stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like eh shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is vishu
I'm like vishu we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with vishu is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over oh I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there eh no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
uh the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
ah cause err
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
err I a few people have jio me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya lah
ya ya ya
ya
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
more you already say live one another alone
ya ya wah I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain wah that one was another one cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
err I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time ah my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear vishu looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry nadi I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay vishu is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
mmhmm
but I remember that
it wasn't that long lah it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe err buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
but ya that was the only thing lah I was just like whoa
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next eh not not country
and then I remember in the beginning it was ah there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause ah they
they had other plans lah okay
ya
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
a'ah
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try lah like I don't know she will like says ah
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure eh maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it lah cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember ah ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like wah their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay oh I remember
and then I ask vishu then why you jio and then vishu was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you mah then I'm like shut up lah don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to vishu the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where ah ya krabi and vietnam with her
it's oh ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause uh our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this uh basically the two of them they have a a very uh err
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far
so we were saying since you guys have limitations so might as well just go malaysia lah
ya
oh ya
gosh oh ya and I was talking to my
other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
cause it's nearby but there's also a lot of places to visit there ya a lot of people don't know about what ya they just didn't do marketing very well like there's technically a lot of places to go to so ya
mmhmm
ya that's the thing
a'ah
okay
alright so how one two three one

huh serious
oh like that I play eh
I also just finish my exam like a week ago
so
I think I can start
but my rank is really low
like
I think I even hit the chicken
so I'm not sure but I can
log in later and see
I hoped they revamp a lot of the
better eh no their
cause like they are so underused like
I'm pretty sure they still got value left
oh layla and eudora
but
but I think I want to try playing fighter also ah
hmm
but I hmm but I used to play assassin also ah last time but I stop already cause like assassin is too squishy
then
oh and the toxic player back then is
so
I try not to play assassin anymore then my rank also went down like from eighty percent
and then it falls to like
I think it's lesser than fifty
skin is
diamonds
on that skin
I spent like
sixty dollars just for the skin on a a hero that I don't even play anymore
so
you know what
I will play mobile legend I will make that sixty dollars worth
okay so you're mythic but
so if you wanna if you want me to play ah I need to like
really do my research for my sixteen dollars game I'm bad seeing revamp heroes them I'm pretty sure they going at the buff heroes also
really
do my research for my sixty dollars game
hmm
but since they revamp hero
then I'm pretty sure they're gonna debuff heroes also
and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar karina anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow ah do you know that
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay lah if you say the toxic is already lessen
err
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range ah
err
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
hmm but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work uh huh
err
I got the premium skin the what is it called ah the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
take freya for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play freya eh freya but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play freya at all I think that one time when you did show me play freya and like I got eighteen kills kan
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
go back to ranking up lah I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay lah I will rank I will rank
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
my is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie eh like shows your survival later but wah I tell you when you play lor ringing like
ya so the like shows your survival rate lah
like wah I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
it gets boring kan I need a challenge also
mm that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay lor but so long okay lah so long you don't take aurora tho
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than vexana at least
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at freya if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my freya I will give it a head oh but
besides freya what else because you cannot play
dragon tales lah
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play balmond I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage eh
so like
and like balmond is like one of those free lah
choose balmond lah cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play balmond and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing kan
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a balmond
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a balmond
okay lah eh the eye
uh huh ya I did my research on hilda
do you know they revamp hilda that's why it's actually
uh
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration
regeneration when she's in the bush
so like recall button hilda they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
eh but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy hilda but I scared like wah I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her lah if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first lor cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
okay lah ya I think if we
well but I don't know lah I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
hylos I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like hylos cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
that's why I don't like hylos I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
then you go into the field full health
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
unless
worse eh
um
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
oh ah lah actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
oh no wonder then
mm then I guess hilda is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you oh ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
or am I
mm but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
I mean staycation is in january tho
we haven't even plan anything
uh and everytime I ask haizat
like
his answer with me like always kan always always like
till now even I ask him earlier also
his first reply
okay first day mm
like dude like all the way
I ask him again like
like I don't wanna keep him out of the planning cause like is a three people thing mah but then like I don't eh he's not even putting in efforts man
I would rather we
kinda like
maybe go for lunch even though
we are carrying a lot of bags lah but then um
can manage lah we eat
a full lunch first maybe and that's chicken and this okay wait no and there's vegetarian
okay first of all me and haizal just talk and he's taking two days leave because he's actually working on a saturday
then um so since he's night shift so he can actually
like working on that friday night also because friday saturday sunday
then he can like I mean he disappointed lah cause he cannot go school anymore so he got like ten days leave
then he was like saying since he's not going to school then might as well use that ten days leave for staycation lah
then um
so he don't mind using
two days for the staycation two nights lah
oh
and do you know that
um
on his last
last week before the end of I mean the new year lah so like december I think his last week in during december
oh
like no need go to work like
just stay home and chill that one really like wah christmas sia
ya
I don't see that happening
cause
okay let's have a meet up point punggol tampines and serangoon and it's one off so we all going one direction definitely one direction
then um
he's already boosting my company okay cause like dude he is like always grabbing like he really don't mind spending twenty six dollar on himself just to grab
it's cause he feel bad that I didn't get a grab home
like earlier that was earlier
and like I'm not the one who has to work
at night so I don't know why he so
adamant into
like paying for my grab
so
so err we compromise so then he pay for hair he pay all
no lah not twenty seven he pay for the
altar
he pay for his ride only then I take bus I mean that's fair
now I'm side tracking the conversation so back to staycation so andes kan
um
it doesn't have to be andes we just see whichever is the
affordablenya
um
salad
mm good life
okay so weird we can have a lunch first
we go off lor to the two one of together
and I don't think we are going to no I'm pretty sure we're going to carry a lot of stuff if I were to be there with a suitcase
you have all the rights to just take my suitcase and smashed my head
do it
and then
buy me a
one of those
one of those what you call that one ah sports bag
ya put all my clothes there instead
yes
that that's a promise please if I bring a suitcase
oh wait
are we bringing a rice cooker
because if we are bringing our rice cooker again I need my suitcase
okay okay since we're not gonna bring rice cooker kan
but you say you need rice you need your rice then we have all the
so they have pots and pans then
is it safe to say that we can
cook rice in the pot and pan
like a natural rice cooker we do it natural way even though it's electric fire but still
and then I can
big like the pretty lah the pretty pretty
I think okay leh
fast leh
okay wait wait haizat don't eat spicy ah
oh my god
seeing a lot of negativity about him
ya I feel like I'm just I'm just like talking bad about that all the way
but did I lie
I did not
so
it's facts be ah I did sidetracked but it's not like
oh and do you know that he is he is
do you saw the who who and the care bear thing right
okay do you know that he's actually
he fully endorsed her to wear both
cause he say it's cute
and then he say can he say he say he don't mind wearing also
I am and I I'm I I'm like
I mean I mean if you're happy if you happy that ya go go ahead
but you want to you want to get the shorts as well then
I don't know I just have the urge to throw a rock at you
and then I told him
if you really don't mind wearing that care bear shirt oh my god I'm side tracking if you don't mind wearing that care bear
kan
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point kan
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
haizat agrees
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
whoa you're only questioning it now dude you should have been oh okay and another thing he he actually also agree that you and him are like two peas in a pod
I don't know ya actually you guys are oh my god ya you guys are just that ya different taste one K pop one is like I don't know western artists I guess
why am I the only different one why am I always the one that is just meeting either one of you huh what is this can you all please
do a collaboration someday or something huh
no lah just kidding lah
I am the the glue to
what are you two um
amoebas
okay wait so
before they I don't know where we're going with this but
going back to our stay cay plans part two
then we meet up earlier cause I know haizat won't be sleeping
then we have lunch then after lunch we check in
then we put our stuff
then I'm pretty sure we're going to be like wah look at the bed
wah look at the sofa wah look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
mm I'm quite concerned because haizat haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
the feel of where we are
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning lah I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
okay okay so
ya lah like you imagine we play
um musical chair but this one is musical container
then like you run one round right then maybe me and haizat play first like whoever we scissor paper stone then one person go out then we chase you then after that one round I go back in then haizat
we scissor paper stone and then
okay what I can feel because today we gym at nine right
the waking up is quite a
quite a weight ah
and not only that right eh how do I feel when I woke up um
like quite ons to start my day leh
is that
did I shower after I gym oh ya I did I did I did shower did I I did
I did
I'm a clean
human being
oh wait um so after after day one what what what's day two
no no I can already tell where this is going
I think it's town area
okay but if we're
just
instead of grabbing there just take public transport lah I mean like not that one hour journey and uh and uh how how much is that twenty six dollars I I I think one hour journey I I mean it's it's okay
um okay lah I get okay you know what how about
I am so ons if we're just going to stay in the container all the way so I mean this going out thing is actually haizat plan eh
wait wait do you want to go out of the container I already ask you that but I feel like I already know the answer because I know you
okay wait but we can we can go outside if we
how do I say if the places are nearby lah but if the place not nearby then I can we have a second suggestion cause I'd rather the place nearby
and
I haven't I've never went past gold like I know like I know my limits
mm but
I think we can one one place I know is cow play cow moo which is quite near one of I mean eh no no that's promenade right
I take it back I don't know where is one-north is what is my workplace all we have is laboratories
I don't know I don't know
if you go by circle line then far lah cause like one-north promenade is like other end to other end leh
I but I think the journey is like forty five minutes max
we talking about food are we going to cook all the way I would rather cook all the way I mean I don't mind eating maggi
I mean come on samyang man I mean uh
no brainer answer samyang all the way to cook samyang
that's like
if aliens were to find me or catch me they open up my stomach they're just going to find samyang no those are not my intestine those are my samyangs
wait where am I going with this so besides samyang what else to eat are we going to eat all the way inside or are we just going to cook
once in a while some more maggi is like
haizat don't even eat spicy so
even maggi is quite limited for him
oh ya Mcdonald that's like the only cheapest food that I know and it's really nearby
one-north
yup okay
so I think food wise should be fine some of us will go shopping before that
yes and we're going to fight over what movie to watch eh if haizat were to pull that lady gaga movie I have no words I will I'd rather watch
weak lah
you all don't watch cartoon I watch cartoon oh wait you watch winx club
I'm so glad I'm not the lowest at the bottom of the food chain
tasteless
oh wait I just exposed to other people that you are watching winx club that's right siti farhanah
watches winx club and she's twenty four years old guys
eh since when I say I watch spongebob I don't watch spongebob I only watch their memes
they are meme materials
and that it's acceptable
I will roast you from hell to back
I can go all the way it's okay no it's it's it's for it's fine if you want to watch my little pony by these people who watches my little pony they are there's a certain
there's a how do I say there's a this weird weird
um group there were just uh my little pony and err I don't think ponies are supposed to doodle stuff so ya I'm judging the that specific group that those they do note that that's not horseback riding right there that no no no no there is something else
no no no it's not the cartoon it's the people watching the cartoon they changed the cartoon and made it inappropriate that's what I was talking about
okay so I guess that's the end
uh
oh ya we haven't do our staycay

but it's not really budget what it's okay lah
ya
it's
in singapore
nobody is going to stare at your body lah
well to be fair since you so paiseh I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like err chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot chope seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty err
no the
are you sure he's the same age as us what
but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that dulan face
annoying sia he's going to give you even more dulan face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the err I don't know he's but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know ah the person is like the the nephew or eh no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue lah
ya ya
ya ya
ya
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you from behind you
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay lah
we
was it we dabao
no before we came before we ah err
I
ya ya
ya so is like
err what's that called it's nice oh but the indo food there is not bad also after
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten err ten every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years lah so she she scared already err ya
so had try lor try and walk err ten ten ten everyday if not like ya
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age ah then you look back at your at your food intake
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food leh she
no she has um err high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now what right like
last time he got juggle his intake meh
exercise ah
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty mah like the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
uh really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that one cannot I I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
mm
oh he cannot take because of this but he's fit what
ah okay okay
ya
wow okay that is quite sian cause like I see him exercise so much and err workout so much and then
ya sugar sugar level quite easy to maintain one as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff lah because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar what so ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know ah don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically lose the
ya
oh shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first uh like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why wow there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but oh ya oh wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was err what's that called ah
with like I think is a vegetarian meal lah so like
no like err there's err you know like those kind that looks like mala but I don't think it's mala it looks like err it's soya sauce so it has like
ya everybody now want to be in err healthy lifestyle err why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one err ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya and I and then we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like eh bo jio
no when people when people jio you you not like you will reply what
ya
not you lah I mean like other people people alamak
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online lah it's like everybody
but then some people will your life like
crazy it's scary lah if you ah used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we err
err
no the dress that I show you the the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot err
aiya
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very sian because I miss it ugh
it is it's available but it's like ugh
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like aiya
ah yes it must not be cause otherwise
err so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like for the black one can wear when we go out but then for the white one maybe wear to like wedding
err thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the white and black dress but it's like a lot ugh
err in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep mah
same
not not about options or design eh like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb ah
ya just
no lah it's not that it's not that jialat what
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years err if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one ah
for me
I think
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel lah if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
ha not so jialat like expand too much right err then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive one is like oh my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
oh let's go see err universal traveller the winter shop

ya ya so so so the doctor told him like ya you can take cab home from the hospital
this one need to clap clap for him cause he just like bring the bike and leave it there I don't know how long already
seriously
apparently the neck still pain eh he's like he said there's this weird feeling I'm like what is weird feeling it's like I don't know it's a bit weird I'm like huh but it's one week already and it's not even an invasive treatment why would your neck be aching more uh like one week after when it's just supposedly an injection
no that's the thing I don't know when is the follow up err follow up appointment the uh I don't know
anyway now he probably quite kanchiong no haven't kanchiong yet because he will only kanchiong like literally twelve hours before the exam he has two papers one on wednesday one on thursday
that's why he actually he very busy so that's why he say uh we go buy cake after your exam I'm like nope I'm gonna go but it today unless the cake don't have an ya if the cake don't have then I said sad okay lah then we we we buy another time

ya that was october ya
ya
I think ah everybody must be crazily booking all the tourist attraction now because of the kids who are all stuck at home and you cannot
is the is your sister one of those kiasu people who book way in advance
advance what
but she never book like staycay or anything meh usually if she cannot travel she will staycay what
expensive leh I tried checking for new year eve the staycay is expensive
ya
but I thought this year don't have they only have uh neighbourhood fireworks
ya it's like you staycay in town to have fireworks in the neighbourhood it's quite
really but cannot see fireworks what from orchard
ah ya lah but you know like
crazy siao like the the there there's this err new hotel called laguna work err it's a golf club lah so it's new
uh near EXPO like somewhere behind EXPO it's a golf club ah ah err so I was checking when they first open I think the room rates were three hundred plus to four hundred then I'm like that's expensive right
and then I check again it's six hundred six hundred
I mean fullerton bay six hundred is like okay but because fullerton bay is like in the middle of the is it called singapore river ya singapore river or sea whatever lah and err
what's that called
but this one six hundred golf club also got no view okay lah
eh but it's quite near EXPO and all the what's that place called ah changi city point
ya
no it's a is it hotel ya gold club ah ya like resort ah
why as in
uh ya
please lah crowne plaza changi is four hundred fifty for normal room
uh ya but also now no planes fly as in very little not like you can watch
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice leh but like aiya I'm not gonna spend that much that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong one they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia one and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in and obviously thailand is a standard one lah a
what we opening office in but they're gonna use err they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like cordon off and use it lah
but is
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not lah
eh I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open err an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
above table under table whatever lah wherever
ya but once we once okay lah not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
ah okay lah not immediately maybe you have to wait until like err I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so leh they say leisure
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't um like if you don't get tested then okay lah basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I ah you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in lah like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also has about what five hundred and twenty million people
that that day pedi said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free what to watch so like they um what's that called they were saying like err please do not travel and to minimise the spread ah the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at err it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are kiasu usually err kiasu kiasi don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
but you will immediately be fined what not meh
chey they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail meh like no no jail like
aiya whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a more serious
it's like how
the india one ah
no but look at
isn't it like err what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
ya
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small what even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five what
so you wear mask at all times at your table
ah that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like huh but we one person what what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone lah I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
that's true have you seen
the rest never mind lah
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that one
eh the the the khatib new err playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
khatib SAFRA ah ya the one uh jason went the the
HomeTeam khatib HomeTeam at khatib I told you before
uh ya but uh maybe not not when uh got menses
okay that one ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more
nope once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
err okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different lah I think you next time shouldn't
no
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like oh you're so caring I'm like what the hell
err
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite kaypoh what no meh
seriously
okay cause like if if
is it the fat boy anas
see that's why you have all these people writing in on like chinese page about how
not every wife wants to play game what
who is asking who like the
orh it works both ways
no what that's why if both parties have to have their own ah
so they
but
they don't talk during the game there but you
ya so wait you can hear you can hear them talking to their kid in the background while they're playing the game
okay
ah ah
ah
ah
okay
orh ya lah
okay
that is like what okay err
eh but surprisingly leh the SIM card that I got in turkey like when we drove for that god knows how many thousand kilometres it work
ah
ya
ah
ya
huh
okay
ya because the turkey SIM card was not bad leh I
ya you know what my brother tried my brother mind game with like how you play I don't know what he play lah we the a friend in singapore on the freaking van ah
he's like okay I'm gonna try and play games see whether the reception can or not I'm like can't you don't be crazy why you playing game when you're in turkey on the road and he's in singapore
yup so I think maybe you might do that if you go road trip
ya and the reception is terrible what like it will be unstable so like
ya lah you play you play for a bit you sleep for a bit and then you see how it is lah
ya
it's like oh I schedule a pap smear
I think in december I don't remember and also like err what's that thing called ah
flu jab
why ah
oh are they gonna rip me apart
oh
huh
what
no no I went to the toilet
but then again kan when you think about it kan err
I think
I I think
err you know our body has muscles there so technically it can stretch if you not forcing it like to stretch it ah
at your vagina or cervix
okay
okay fine that one government subsidy government government paid a bit right
government should pay full not pay a bit
err oh my god
ya the older people all have lah
oh ya ya the fibroid
right and then after that I'm like
ah
ya ah
everybody thinks like oh this person single mum is it
ya
siao lah
a spotify or
ah
ya
eh I talking about this um
I don't know whether I told you but err so like uh I watched Tiktok videos right so in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
but the thing is
ya I like why would you why would you be why would you give birth at fourteen okay lah but I think the is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
huh
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
ee but then it has no rubber at the side
ya
so it's like
oh no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
but it's just like I don't know it
err ya is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything
what had he gain
catch ball
next time just catch the ball don't catch the sperm

uh huh
ah
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents ah
mm
mm
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum ah
having disputes ah
ah ah ah
mm mm mm
mm
yes
grow up
ya
tense up ah ah
ya ya
fight ah ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing ah ya
ya ya
ya
a'ah
ah
probably probably ya
mm
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear lah ah if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why ah what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside leh you look soft outside and inside you are eh fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it ah
adamant ah
oh okay okay okay
ya
mm
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also lah
ya
mmhmm
ya eh you know what dude actually what right uh one thing you should actually I recommend lah you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book ah dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that eh no no some people actually uh you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique lah then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a wah dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what lah but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good lah
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook ah and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F ah
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel um wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the mats can walk like that or the bengs they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like whoa so big like they as if they got like big triceps ah that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also lah ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
oh really ah
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time lah ah
opening ah ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
a'ah then then then
I I think so ah why ah recall recall recall help me recall
oh ya okay okay then then then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
oi my memory very bad lah bro very bad bro mm
mm
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
ah
ya
ya
okay
something new ah
oo
okay ah
ya ya you can like transfer ah ya
okay
ha
flying ah mm
ah
okay
okay
okay
ya
mm
mm mm mm
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky ah that person should never have been a pilot sia but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
oh eventually they change lah when did they change
okay okay
mm
mm ya ya ya
okay
wah motivated like crazy sia
oh very young ah
ah
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
uh huh
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
mm
oh okay okay
mm
okay
okay
let go ah
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying ah you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly what okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay ah
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength ah ya ya ya
oh but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career lah it's more of like uh okay okay not not so much of a mistake lah not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
ah
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
ah
okay
ah
mm
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy okay
ya
ya
oh
a'ah
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
mm
okay
this was when ah
how you afford all these things man operation lah go lah
you loan ah
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
oi okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room ah
but you're
ya
ah who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
eh that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know ah it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no ah
just a cross ah oh okay
no you know why because I don't know lah it depends on my future lah because for now there's a lot of changes ah okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
dubai right dubai airline is it
oh
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience ah
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that lah
ah
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit lah ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry lah the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts ah
mm
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal ah
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
mm
wah how many airplanes sia bro like that
wah I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue lah like from steward to be flying lah okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is uh my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
oh you went through the three months ah oh it was supposed to be that stage already lah oh
wah dude that time if you fly ah your inter pretty stable and nice ah bro four to six K easily sia
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike ah
ya ya
walao I don't think that's anywhere close sia
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there sia on the drone
okay
that's relatable lah
ah okay okay so it's just a matter of time lah
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of mumammad salihin
ya then eventually when people see the peak ah lah it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession eh but okay lah but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like oh crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum lah so ya but but but no lah I I wish you all the best ah brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it lah it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field oh
mm
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him ah ya like before him right you see bush wah everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him ah the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman lah
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics ah in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no lah bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back eh okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that lah but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead mah like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks what the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people lah the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have genghis khan you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them lah you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that um people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person lah how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now lah because if I go there I will die of boredom sia
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something lah but I'm not in touch with him that much lah
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old lah I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains ah then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom lah there's nothing to do sia there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know lah okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how sia
a plan ah
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business lah oh I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no lah basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay lah I will just give you a brief verbal presentation ah people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example oh bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why oh why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
ah
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much mah
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility lor
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay lah you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people lah okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole lah which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor lah okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk mah you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan lah okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets lah you know you buy Rolex lah you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there mah
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions lah your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong lah but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example ah they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government uh supreme court order you to pay lah like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone lah that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore ah
cannot ah
their their their passport is blocked what they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead lah you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go lah you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you uh they cannot lah they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay lah they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy ah so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna uh work in production houses if the company feel like eh there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you lor private entity what
ah so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
ah like this kind of job ah the one that is got profile one ah they normally will not hire you one
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system lah ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests ah
ya lah for example okay I give you a scenario ah let's say you owe ten thousand lah the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred lah
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month lah okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial uh the debt trap ah okay so the second way is to pay a minimum eh

four bars
oh my god the parking the parking can pay off my bike instalment babe I swear
is still the best option if you're still just a couple
I don't think I can sustain a fucking car

regulars eh
is there like no place that he can appeal to or write to
that's bullshit eh babe
oh my god

like utensils their like equipment is all their stuff
ya
oh are you serious
are you serious
can transfer to other people or not
like ya sell your package to someone else
oh
why you still continue to pay sia babe
right
oh my god babe that's a lot of money sia
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put uh a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that oh because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
wah I will angry sia
ya
oh you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
err like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him lah he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like oh
just like
I think it's quite cute lah like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right um the last girlfriend ah he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like oh so like to him it means a lot lah that he ask me then I was like orh okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
um also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with hassan
me I still have unresolved issues with hassan
ya we're still not talking tau babe
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover wah I felt like the shittiest daughter ever sia babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like ah loose threads or like uh consequences on some like those aftermath of me and hassan that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with aqil and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with aqil I want to be with aqil only and not have like oh this is because of hassan that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about hassan like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
take care of himself
I think so ah because like he was a great boyfriend sia babe only things things messed up after the relationship
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year ah
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way sia babe like
like the thing with hassan all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet aqil and this is going to happen
ya
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time ah babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and aqil
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
ya I don't know ah like
I mean I really really hope hassan
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness ah babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship lah after that I don't know what happened
right
uh after after hassan
cause you were still with audi and then like we went out remember you me hassan you me hassan audi ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so eh babe
uh like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like um cold like he's very err like
ah very action ah
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like uh when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then err he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder ah like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
be someone that they're not
then their true form comes out wah scary ah
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
ah
okay
like that would be
babe thailand the best place ya
oh ya you went with your family right
that's nice
I tell my parents I go with you
huh
ah ah
oh right
ya not your thing okay okay I get it
oh my god
bangkok is it
I think it's bangkok right
like
sorry
no lah I think you you and simon should have your time first
you guys should go bali sia babe
no like bali is is accepting like tourists at the end of the year
so you should like
eh they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice nice ass views and the food's pretty good I think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights lah you just have time for each other
just lepak with each other
oh my god they're gonna transcribe this
ya like typing it out like okay so miza um said she and aqil colon
oh right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
then ah
ah ya the the they were in the lot and then like aqil saw them then aqil was like eh and then he park near near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like err Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
huh
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
mm
like his jealousy
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
firdaus is an idiot
ya
you know
we got seven more minutes
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce aqil to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like oh my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like aqil like morals also questionable
like he ah he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
ya
ya
right
mm
your mum
ya
eh how's your mum is she okay
err I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
uh
most likely early next year
or mid next year
but I told him ah like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like oh no lah but like he wants to
then I say it's fine um like we can like plan lah like
try to understand and see other people's view ah like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with

three two one
okay hi
a'ah lah adulting kan like
ya lah
oh
I I now just studying because uh
a'ah
now it's all being put to a stop kan like temporary
okay lah um
the government got give some money then I do like odd jobs in

it's okay ah I think everyone having a hard time ah
I mean okay no maybe not everyone but most people are ya lah a'ah
mm

no choice lah I have to work ah
ya
irritating tau that because I think best like what you said lah face to face
ya
mm
why ah people like this
oh
ha
ya ya
mmhmm
ya lah ya lah
I think it's going to go to phase three soon ah so maybe that that that then some office can open
um I heard lah I don't know whether true or not
ya recently like very small cases lah ya
ya because my my aunt also she
now uh alternate between like one week in office one week at home so at least I think that's the not that's the best idea lah
you know
so at least we gonna
oh
oh
oh
oh
tracetogether oh
mm maybe maybe
ya lah ya lah
dah lose the vibe ah
ya
ya
oh
whoa
a'ah a'ah
I did eh
oh
wah okay congratulations
mm
ya lah ya lah
I
oh
I don't like to order
uh my house not a lot of
nice food okay because
but then my family doesn't she they are very strict on the halal cert so
um ya lah then it's like when as I choose it always have to be a halal food then our halal selection quite limited so I'm very sick of the stuff that we order in already
so ya then then
ya but then if I'm eating at home then like
they will know what I'm ordering and things like that so
ya
why
jurong
wah
I I
huh

first of all you guys have three malls to eat at
right three malls
JEM
ah

more jurong side ya

no ah okay okay
ya aww

like what you say lah introverts then not a lot of people to invite anyway cause
my bridesmaids jer dah ten
how to uh get married like that then I'm like
I don't even think I have like bridesmaid you know
maid of honour ah that one different
ya that's why I'm like
we already planned this wedding for a long time and I have five bridesmaids then you say can only invite ten people so how am I going to go through with this
ten people I think I have eight people then the other two is just extra I have to invite because they are family you know
ya ya it's like
ya
oh
ya ya um then your your brothers not married yet
oh that's like next month
oh
I don't think so ah
like
ya because their cases also very crazy ah that's why
I mean I also miss going to and things like that lah but then
a bit scary lah
err
mm
I almost said city square mall but I know that's not
the mall that I'm talking about ah ya ya that's not that right ya
city square mall isn't that in singapore
ya but you get what I mean lah ya ya
um usually woodlands ah I take the the stupid bus to go over
then ya ya ya
oh
oh ya okay okay
uh
wah you busy sia
but good lah ya
correct correct
mm
mm
ah
oh
a'ah
mm
wah you not bad ah
still going strong ugh
ya
mm
is it I love wearing the mask eh
it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya lah that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the uh the what they call the resting bitch face ah
do ah then after that then I will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something ah
you know
so ya but then
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them
ya ya
tegur
sometimes I don't even notice them you know when I'm just like blur lah you know like
ya
ya
mm
ya
so
ah
hello
oh F&B but now no more ah
then I want to find another industry to work at
then also
ah ya still searching lah that's why I I end up
about knowing this lah
ya
a'ah ya lah that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
ah
ya lah ya lah
ah
that's why
I don't know ah what's going on also
mm depends ah
they said
mm
ya lor recently I got a job offer
um the pay is okay lah the the work scope and time also okay
ya
ah what
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you lah but ya
mm mm then
mm
mm ya usually they they like um and they like they prefer
registered people ah usually
but like
ya I
what
ya lah ya lah that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax ah
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope ah
ah
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
um
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
like they just like mood totally go down seh I don't know ah then
because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training tau
then she say to me like um what ah
you come here you don't know anything uh then how you going to teach the kids
then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
ya
ya ya
ya
she said twice eh in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting what
so uh she complain to the boss in chinese
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
fine whatever just
keep quiet ah then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed lah because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing lah basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I uh obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do lah because
do okay you can quite teach lah but then
ya so that one gone ah
ya
ya lah ya lah
err
a'ah
a'ah
but in in terms of what do you mean
like
mm
ah
oh you mean ah are you like developers or
not really
oh
oh ya ya ya
wah that's interesting ah I was contemplating learning that
ya because um
upper course ya
that's cool ah
because I got media arts
um diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
mm
a'ah
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating ah so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
ya
mm suffocating
like means what
oh
I don't know eh
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone oh I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like eh actually I don't feel like going out ah then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
shiok ah like we living our best life ah but then I suffocated in a sense that
um
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
sometimes the things they do is just
ah ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy lah because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
oh um still the same also lah two but um I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird leh because um
like I'm the eldest kan
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
ya
so
barrier crossed and then
um she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree lah
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off lah ya
mm
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood ah
ya but she got the cert lah ya
no lah she working in those like F&B jobs lah
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know eh
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
law legally binding law law what you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
ah then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
mm
is it
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
um relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can um
get uh engaged and married what
oh okay that one also I don't know but normally lah normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya mm
I mean that's
uh that's from my experience lah I don't know whether
not like I got married before lah but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya oh this is how it's supposed to be ah I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
err uh um almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because uh first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous what
sorry what
whatever lah you know ya ya so
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity lah I feel
why
ah
ah
mm
oh my god
ah
but uh I think it's okay ah cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
oh okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy lah then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know oh I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay lah like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
um I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy lah you
so then how huh
oh
mm
oh ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family kan but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
girl ah ya ya ya my mum ya lor that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
mm
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that lah
but so far I've been going over they quite okay leh it's more like okay it's actually um my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how lah but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said lah we both like have our own place already
and then like okay lah maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period lah
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house lah
and the in-laws house
ya
mm
ya ya
because like
I feel
oh okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say um last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
so but then she say lah like in now these days a bit difficult lah but then
her ideal goal is still to move out lah ya
but then ugh
like
why you don't like the the the partner ah
mm
ya the okay
eh
ask her to get out ah really ya ya ya okay dah
ugh
ya ya ya
oh my gosh that's interesting eh
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
mm okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in jurong no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
ya
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought jurong was cool like the west side you know like oh cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of yishun
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay jurong a bit dodgy
a'ah
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of jurong
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
wah that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
mmhmm
yes it's true
ah
mm
oh ya ya that's right
mm
hmm do you like that or not
okay
mm
oh
those are touch and run away kind ya
ah
ah
ah
mm
a'ah
the what you do
what the
ah ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
watch group wah your parents also very ons eh
ah
oh
mm
mm interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
ya but I don't think I can be like you lah
like the last three times uh people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
uh
more like like I think too well of myself
ya
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me ah want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it ah like what you say ah
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
empty kan
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
ah ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door ah
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya oops I cursed
ya lah ya lah so I'm just like oh I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
most of the not most of the jobs that I want lah but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no ah ang mo kio also got industrial park lah but that one is different industry
but ya
I mean not easier lah it will be
mm ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
um ya
would you rather town or tanjong pagar
it's a bit far for me
uh huh
ya
I cannot lah I I just for me I feel I get
mm
ya
ya lah ya lah
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
ugh
so it's damn irritating
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
ah I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons lah pros and cons
mm
ya
I don't know ah I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan kan like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID lah so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that lah like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
mmhmm
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
mm
obviously ya
interesting
ya lah ya lah such is life
my plan
a'ah
but I think he don't want lah
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long eh like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said lah he still need a teaching degree
then I'm just like wah that's very long eh that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that lah
a'ah
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that lah
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
study jer but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job ah so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me lah sometimes I wish I just have a nice uh rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
uh you lah
uh qian jin is a
actually I don't
I don't know ah like when back then like cause I was your age not so long ago um
not really keen on getting married or getting attached even
you know so I'm just like
I met him then I was like actually we can click ah then like so we fall
like in love so like not I'm in a relationship
so I don't know what to do with that dream
mm
what
online lah
a'ah
like
so I was like trying to like meet new people like of same interests as me you know
then
no no twenty five was when I don't want to get married
so in that course then I'm just like ya but then now it's like
you have to think about the past and everything
ya
ya
mmhmm
a'ah
whoa
how you meet yours
eh we should add each other up on like game platforms sia
uh
right now
okay um I don't like mobile games just to put it out there so
you do I hope it's okay eh I'm
and I'm poor so I can't afford consoles or things like that so I only play like games and things like that what about you
everything oh
where you get time
you school you study then you can play game wah shiok
crazy
true true true
true also
ya lah
ya that's why you know because like
I feel lah like I didn't plan to fall in love lah but then it's like you know
I'm just doing whatever I like and then
things fall into place so now I don't know ya what
ya ya so you were saying about your gaming thing
what
genshin impact
no
I
a bit
I don't I purposely don't want to play that because I'm a huge zelda
fan and I
the the the ya the
drama lah I don't know lah ya
ya ya ya
ya
wow
whoa
eh cool sia
mm ya I don't play fortnite
I mean I mean I've never play ah I don't know how it's like so ya
mm
like what
oh
mm
I will not last long in that
mm I think because of COVID right
I downloaded animal crossing so now I'm still addicted to it
ya
mm
ya
why suddenly like it was like famous for sometime I don't know why
you know
mmhmm
oh okay
I I didn't play with my boyfriend
ya
ya
interesting
did you buy the five no sorry what
a'ah
okay ya cause I see only then ya
mm
correct ah that's what I think so
no I using three so old right ya
ya
oh what it's just the same games over and over again lah
don't have
uh I don't even know what I want to call it
I guess you can say that huh
uh

err my day today was okay it was quite a slow day uh
because I didn't do much uh today
um I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work lah
I haven't actually applied for anything
err I was there was this err job link that adli sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
err
err annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly lah but then there was an addendum to the title
that said uh it was uh
malay language specialist
basically just listen to
and then
transcribe them into
words ah
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
err natural language processing
feel
which is more concern with err and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually err learns language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then err
so
so ya lah the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
ah yes I will be part of that
a'ah
soon lah in a few days lah I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
so like
I got no results
the
err
so far no uh except for a few that I saw err
err wherever lah I think there's a few locations
no like err I I meet the requirements ya
mm
okay lah the exam was
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and err second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy uh
the best eh
probably second language learning
huh why
no uh because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory what so it's more difficult to screw up
ya ya I just want to pass
mm ya
your leave
mm
mmhmm
hmm
wait pause they made you take
a test
ah
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training eh
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya your boss's boss
ya
mmhmm
huh how come your computer shut down in the room
oh so the
so basically the zoom thing crash lah nothing wrong with your computer lah
okay okay good
whoa
okay uh
I sat in the chair
but it's okay lah I mean I managed to
err get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was err
that one maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want ah
I mean
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
ah
then he suddenly appears
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift eh
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
so
so basically there was no person in charge lah for the thing
wah co in charge lah
on the ups
mmhmm
mmhmm
after six
oh okay
oh
oh okay okay
ya
hmm
so he's new
ah
mm
oh
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
eh to whoever's listening
confidential okay
mmhmm
the what thing
oh okay
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
mm err on the days you're schooling
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
you
oh you cannot request for shift change eh
oh for your class eh
eh I think I destroyed your chair
oh okay
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
mm
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
mm
ya
mm
I think you felt the same way in that
take a break if that makes sense
mmhmm
oh shit serious ah
mm
ya
mmhmm
justin bieber
oh
oh they are not big fans of justin bieber
mm
have different workflows eh
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
oh ya lah
you better do it
ya
serious ah
mm
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit err
weird
like
there's no
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you uh
the previous shift
complacent ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I don't know uh I think
honestly to me
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send uh
in what sense
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh
ya
mm
wait
okay
mm
mm
a'ah
ya like you
mm
mm
oh ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
a'ah
mmhmm
ah
ah
jaded
mm
oh okay
I was actually going to make a joke
ah okay lah
mm
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
huh
ya ya they know we we also know
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker eh
no no there's there's
ya there's
no now that one person has more uh
malay vocabulary to transcribe
ya ya
I don't know uh but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
kan it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine ah it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable lah
aiya
ah
a'ah sia
ah ya lah of course lah it's their job
just anime like
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching um
err Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
err
err there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
maybe add three or four months
ah ya
in japan
oh
but mm
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file ah
cloud
oh ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one ah
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
artefacts
but but then again
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands uh two thousand one to two thousand and four
the actual film
like
err like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
or like something someone would draw in paint
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the kan the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
err
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
huh
I mean you have an eye for the frame what
and then after that you will get like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things uh like
behind ya that kind of shot ah
mm
A U T E U R eh
a'ah
auteur
ya
but
err anything ah can also uh
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
flexible
in what sense
mm
okay ya
mm
oh to get ah ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and err location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
but with
a
psychological uh age not twist ah like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about ah
that looking into the
err
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay ah stimulating ah but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like um
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and err
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
err three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
through
err power
you know and like
a display of real fear
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
err
let's see
ah the wailing
the wailing
it's like
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
mm
ah
ah
ah
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
mm
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
mm
oh ya ya a'ah
mm
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail ah
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
oh ya that's okay okay we watched that one
we watched that one in the cinema uh
nevermind ah
I think that one will I probably will have to watch with rehan lights off speakers on
oh
mm
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it ah
eh I got A you know don't play play you know
director of photography ah
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
ah
no you know no
no lah we do it we do it properly lah but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from err getting
uh machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
oh ya
no need ah low budget ah indie
live what
no lah it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no lah
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free lah
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
oh ya correct correct
okay lah then when we on our off day then we do ah
I think can can no worry can be done
oh ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon lah
like next year
uh my hot ah
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or what
ah whatever game you can try you try ah
mm you never try Borderland three
buy ah
for the for the release price lah the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday eh
what you buy
oh ya
oh ya later ah later
masks
yes
compress
okay lah
oh okay
huh
I want to I want to take one
nezuko
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation ah
ya lah so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the weeaboos it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
then I'm like bro you don't know what the weeaboos go through
I think
mm
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic ah in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
oh no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
mm
uh haikyu is not that
mm
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
oregairu
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
grounded in realism
ya like it was well thought out and well written ah
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season ah
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
mm
how it works is usually
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
ya
so that's basically how it works uh
mm
ah
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm
oh
mm
hmm
mm
J drama
mm
ah I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas eh
mmhmm
makeup
okay lah
decently young lah
oh
mm
mm
oh bullying eh
mm
ya
uh huh
uh huh
okay
mm
international
because there's a connection
mm
mm
mm ya
oh I mean jakarta is the city pe
oh okay
I think maybe most people who want to take korean are nice people
the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
ah then after that I I I off I off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me
oh okay
mm
oh okay
a'ah
ah
ah
ah
oh yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
mm
oh yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
mm
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of err child language development
ya I learnt that
ah
koreaboo
but oh ya the key caps
wah
ya then it was like seventeen like that
oh okay
it dropped down some more
ya one O four key
huh
uh most of them use the same stems anyway lah

hi I'm okay
mmhmm
orh
all the way
oh wow
mm mm
mmhmm ya
oh wow
mm
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
hmm
err
and then they they said err depends ah ma'am depends I said huh
circuit breaker ya orh
mm mm
mm on that day itself ah orh okay okay
mm mm
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing seh it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job lah basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like uh mcdonald's then okay ya err like customer number one two three four and then they just say ah ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
mm
mm mm
mm
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business huh
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like huh
mm mm
oh my god really
is it because of circuit breaker
mm mm true lah
uh uh
mm mm
mm mm
huh
mm mm
thanks eh
ah maybe lah mm mm mm mm
so ang moh lah you know and then
ya but it's quite serious lah because I don't know
ah
mm eh
mm mm mm
orh
oh
mm mm okay okay
mm orh
mm mm
oh
oh my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
mm aedes correct ya
mm
most likely it is lah
mm mm mm mm
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat lah once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
mm correct correct
every other day sure got some story one
in the news both mm mm local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting sia I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like oh my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
crazy mm mm mm mm mm
huh oh my god
so scary
oh my god
mm mm fifty five
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya lah that's true lah mm mm it's a bit more controlled lah ah
mm mm true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know mm mm
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
natural garden ah
ya definitely definitely
mm mm
ya that's true
mm mm
ya lah I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like err quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that oh my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know lah I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important seh
mm mm
I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like walao like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about um you know using this reserves for
for all the I mean all these schemes lah like you said so
mm mm ya lor that's why funny ah
mm mm almost half a year lah
mm mm
ya that's on transport food ya
mm mm ya lah ya lah correct
mm mm mm mm
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
mm mm
something that I don't know like
ya lah
correct correct correct or just do virtual lor everything nowadays virtual virtual event
but everything lah everything is now virtual lah like but it's quite actually interesting lah like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
ya that's true mm mm
endless seh like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
like you say lah they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
mm mm
mm mm
wah
funny ya
ya lah sometimes no choice is the best choice lah ha
mm mm
mm mm physical is no longer really needed lah ha
mm mm mm mm
ya lah but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
normal I guess you know
mm mm ya
ah wow amazing mm mm
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya lah mm mm
mm mm ya lah ya lah
mm mm cancelled kan oh postpone ah okay okay
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know lah I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
oh ya I think I saw that
mm mm
nature is healing ah mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
mm mm mm mm
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
mm mm mm
mm mm less is more
mm mm
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving what you know
mm mm
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it lah you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell lah oh okay mm mm hobby eh
mm mm ya that's true
ya lah must be positive lah because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done lah of course but can be done it can be done ya
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
true
standard ah
mm mm
I mean it's complaining is part of life lah you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
mm mm true very true
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely kan uh uh
ya
mm mm
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see eh
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like mm
mm mm

it was okay lah um they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that err they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there jer siala what is my five year plan
err there's a position that opens up in a different department and um my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to ah
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay mm answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees ah sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like oh
but it gives me a very nice err
oh long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long oh they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can err I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like oh I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like eh so what you want do you for five years ah ah you know like you like you could say like huh five years ah wah I never really think about it eh and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also err
you also answer like oh never really think about it eh but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long lah but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer lah so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say ah oh ah I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee um so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve um more things
which is true I I think it's also like um I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that oh err in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K oh you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you eh I give you three point five lah you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic what so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different um setting it's all about how you make it um you make it work in the in in this stuff kan lah fourteen december
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that um
I don't want to be too greedy lah like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale wah that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack ah but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
yes I know your work right um about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
err
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say lah hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like wah you say this kind of things ah
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and err we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household lah but you know on an average
mm
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand wow
wow
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up lah I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel lah but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account eh there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically um
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't err I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say oh it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website err can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account eh you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting um this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
err it's the security

the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks

and then um
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes

so that's why you have to wear safety shoes for safety reasons
monday to friday yes

ya
so meaning next month I work that whole month right and then after that
the in january then I get the pay the mid jan
ya I don't like that kind because is
my sister said is because of the government sector

I mean your
earlier hmm

ya that's why my my
my phone bill is end of the month gym is early month

no then mine is one three six then my cousin one is one five something
I think but my one was
mine is

the promo ended already because ah you sign up with a insurance then you paid a little bit then you get this price
but it doesn't add up one eight zero
ya
ya then is then because my friend say like join GYMMBOXX or anytime fitness then I was like huh anytime fitness is like what eighty eight
mm
not that I
I been there once and then but I just don't like
like very
the weight is not is not the same

it was either all so I just take the gym but
F forty five is a shit
oh ya because
like because everybody is like
you are new
then everybody know each other and then ya and then like but it depends on the centre itself like my centre is jurong one right and then is family oriented-ish
no no as in how they mix around is very family-ish
and then after that they will go round
then like okay let's go let's go let's go ah
huh
oh is it
F forty five

ah
that day I I accompany him at holland eh not holland V err
where ah tiong bahru
for interview but he don't want ah
via zoom lah

interviewee something ya
that he doesn't have background and everything then he say never mind we can help you err we can guide you and everything there but when when he went there nobody guide him
so everything like basically he sat there
ya

I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
that's why that's the thing
think about anything but then again
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any
to find your places that you want to go lah
a lot of steam food a lot of soup a lot of herbs

err help to revive our very own
economy so I hope that so I hope that I hope that uh we will we will be able to come out of this uh COVID nineteen strong and hopefully we will
go back to being normal arab we will all still stay happy and positive
okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye

okay I'm in
ya
ya
ya ya
how many people
wow
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
mmhmm
I think
they are
ya
ya
ya it's not basically is minuscule
I don't know
that's good man
that's good
ya I think so
so what next week starts ah
no
mm
ya ya ya ya
uh your skills your skill set and your experience kan
ya
the phase three ya
should be end jan
ah
you mean this this christmas coming now
okay
ya uh
okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya
mm
mm
would you be able to do that
ya
different things to do ah
ya
too tired
eh
feed her feed her
mm
mm
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
kan
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
err and then
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
ya no lah fosterer no
what
ya uh yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic ah they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say oh the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say eh your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay lor
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the uh but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
government
ah G O V
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish lah cannot be
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way lah you know ah in fact I was just talking about it to uh to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing kan
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean kan it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish lah what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
no they don't both okay
I mean this this this look at
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in pasir ris why because pasir ris you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no pasir ris farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to tengah now they are all in tengah now the animal welfare groups so they are developing pasir ris that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible uh to all residents who are going to panic
ah
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
oh wow
ah
oh they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is um is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again uh so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute kan
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya aww
is it oh so sweet
ya
aww bless her aww ya
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment lah
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you kena fine lah or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
uh okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home kan
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear lah some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough lah you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering lah I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering lah
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it uh we we tell people to be responsible feeders
they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no lah maybe not here lah but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
which is good lah to remind people you know kind of like that kan
ah
oh my goodness
they are copy cats
ya lah that's called district cats lah they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
mm
ya
ah
ah ya
eh
mm
because so much traffic eh
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm ya
but it's quite safe what this this tree
traffic
uh ya
ah
okay
ya
ah
ya
back to their refuge lah
people who work there know where these fellas go uh their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way oh then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
uh so funny and it's true right they would go almost every uh almost everyday
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where ah the drains ah does it go to I don't know uh so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but uh it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
uh so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules uh I guess you know the the otter felt safe lah
oh
you know there are a few families ah apparently
otter
there is a fan club ah
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
so they have the okay only the otter fan club lah
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know oh this is the kallang clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
this is their territory oh then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not kallang so that is the one so they have different families lah all clans
maybe another clan huh
ah ah so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
I don't think they look for other clans
um when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say kallang clan is like is like this is their territory
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks ah this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
I guess among themselves lah I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook aiyo so sad ah I think that was one was near uh
uh one of the um
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news lah okay so what I remember in the news
um
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove um they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far um the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts lah
one of their hangouts you know ah
ya ya ya
wah the otters right
cute right
ya uh
eh cute
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
ya
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no uh unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like uh in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say oh this the the the kallang clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like wow bloody hell how do they know I guess they know lah they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
you know not the caretaking type lah but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the ulars maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay lah let's put it this way lah shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction tau
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no lah they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
ah then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release lah
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again

provided you didn't do all sorts for your nonsense all sorts of your nonsense lah which
I'm not going to disclose I'm not going to disclose lah that's why I
then err
I think
err I'm fine with everybody it's just that I cannot get along right with I cannot get along with

I really really don't that
I really really don't like
so
ya lor actually in all honesty ah I kind I kind of hate everybody ah
I kind of hate everybody

more than I hate myself
is a very interesting character is one in a million diamond in the rough
should tell her that ah
tell her that
you have any other hot friends
yes I'm very I'm I'm very very I'm for life
or am I
I don't know I'm I'm I'm regretting all my time in right now
no
actually that's really messed up that's really messed up you know the fact right that all
all most of the
toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened ah
like you know
is most of them right that make the news ah is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in you know then err
and this is not the and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up
that was just that was just brought up
then err but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago ah
because I sleep in school
so uh and
my friends they also know they also know this ah
most of the it's
and some more it's in you know how embarrassing
no lah but
no lah but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in you know shit
no
but then again but but then again but then again
err most of the
err most of the incidents takes err take place in ah
whereas the places where I
patron right err
the toilets where I go to ah they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they uh most of them
err some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge ah
I'm not too sure about this lah I can't confirm but
there are some right where
err
I think this one also depends on the price of your accommodation ah
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
so
err
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
so the guy actually err took I still remember you err he had the
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered ah so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
err
you know that like single floor toilet ah
it's just a
it commune toilet ah communal toilet ah that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why lah people
err those pervs right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense ah
um there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a
second if you don't have a you need to uh err
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame ah err that's lame lah uh I
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but currently it's no longer the case already like
uh for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you ah
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know and then sweat your punk ass
and then err like or hall activities ah like
yay sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey ah it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time err
err they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts ah
so they had I swear to you ah it was really cringey
err they had those like err orientation games ah then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they uh like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey lah
who the hell is running man
who is running man
I have no idea who the hell that is
maybe it's just me lah ah probably it probably is lah just me but
until now I still don't get
err
I don't get the concept of hype beast
I don't understand the concept of hype beast
err last time it used to be
the trend is tight T-shirts is like slim fit tight T-shirts now the trend is
loose or slightly oversized T-shirts so
err
it's weird lah if you ask me
meh
what trumpist
rare commodity okay
oh okay wait hold up hold up you're referring to you're referring to
oh okay lah that's pretty american lah you don't I don't see that the the closest thing I've seen in singapore is um
err I think there was one time I think err can't remember what's her name ah she wore a baseball T-shirt
she wore that was like baseball baseball outfit
to work
no lah but filipino is like that what they that's their that's their sport ah
that that's their sport it's the same as it's the same logic as
I think philippines
philippines they have a they are known to really like
they are known to like basketball
and they are also known for engineering and nursing also that's why
you see ah like when err back in my old workplace ah the one before
the one before
the guy err he also told me also and
the place there right there were quite a handful lah there were quite a lot of err filipino guys ah
so ya
oh okay
damn
filipino ah to begin with
how sure are you
really
okay
okay fine whatever
wei xiang is which one
oh wait it
okay right then
mm
really
wait
what's he is he working there full time what what's his position there what's he doing exactly in
until now
and that's such a waste ah
like I mean err I get I mean if
if your highest hopes in life right is to be a cashier
for a departmental store right then more power to you lah but
it kind of sounds like a shame ah what did he study when he was in when he was pursuing his diploma
ah
can can you I don't know got stocks to trade for FairPrice that kind of thing ah
oh really
really
okay I really I probably wouldn't know any of this shit
a million dollars
what kind of lifestyle like player player
okay
that's gay
this is this
wait is he still with the same guy
until now
not that I care lah but
err
err my question is right
what is that guy doing
tool
hold up jack's is the okay ya then
wait which again the one at ang mo kio
oh really wait there there's a jack's in ang mo kio meh
no okay that one I know already it's that one wait is that is that one still around
wait so it's it's an affiliate of jack's ah it's like one of the sister companies ah
or like
okay lah fine
you know it doesn't take a diploma her his higher his esteemed diploma right from
were from whatever polytechnic right you know you you can you know work as a cashier at you know with
err less with less than qualifications right
he is aware of that right
oh how the tables have turned
hold up the boyfriend is rich still mooches off
your friend ah
so was that the turning point
for him turning homosexual
okay
mm you can't you can't put a you can't put a price on love right though
wei xiang two hundred range
hais oh my gosh
your friends right your friends are like
extra retarded ah for real
so joe rogan
that ethics of becoming an Instagram model
is there anything ethical is is there an ethical aspect right to being an Instagram model
because Instagram after all right is just a page where you put photos
I mean ultimately ultimately right when it when it boils down to the you know like
common denominator type thing ah
it's just a web page it's just a page where you see photos
so is there and ethical ground right behind being an a model on Instagram
like what what constitutes ethics ah in
Instagram modelling like what you you have to
I mean like what like what you
be you you be super hot you take a photo right of you being hot right around starving africans
is that ethical
wait which one was it
no
probably because you didn't feed it to me
lies lies okay anyways
so is the sister the sister is
wait what okay fine ya okay ya ya
oh okay okay wait hold up hold up so
technically right technically he
he didn't he didn't flash
in a sense right in a sense right
he advertised himself right as he
he try to proposition for
ah for sex right for minors
from minors right with
by
know using using his fame ah not with paper ah
oh really
come with me in my videos
who is him dee kosh
would you want to know dee kosh
why not
so wait this is what gay privilege
oh wait hold up that amber
huh which finger
okay then
Tesla guy
the elon musk okay fine then
but to begin with right does he does he even know right that
those people are minors or not the his victims right
did he know that they were minors
okay
if that was the case right my question is
who are the people right who empower dee kosh
where does dee kosh derive right his fame from YouTube right who empowers him
is the youth of today
why
because right we're easily swayed we're easily we're easily swayed right by stupid shit
by simple stupid shit
to begin with also right
that's it
am I right to say am I right to say I can't remember what's the author's name ah err am I right to say right that
err the person who wrote catcher in the rye right
err the person in the catcher who wrote catcher in the rye right is a influencer
because he influenced the guy to go and assassinate the the kennedy
you know kennedy ya
ah ah okay oh my goodness ya john lennon ya
to influence them to do what
okay
but Instagram by itself right but but Instagram by Instagram by itself right
is just a platform only ah is the people is to me right
to me if you ask me personally right I would say that it's the kids of today ah it's
the young impressionable kids of today right who are so drawn into
nonsense antics right who
who follow this guy ah who give this guy a following who
in return right he generates he generates revenue right from
err you know from uh from his
the the legions the legions from his legions of ah from his
no the legions of followers that he has uh uh okay I'm being sarcastic lah about the legions lah cause I don't think he has
he got he got himself into he got himself into
into this kind of into this kind of nonsense then to amplify this to amplify the
situation right on a personal on I guess on at
face value level type
thing ah he
you know he makes a living he he makes a living talking about people mah and also like talking to
see what happened lah the tables have turned the tables have turned already ah the tables have turned lah err it
come it kind of like goes to show right that
you're not as smart as you think you are lah you probably didn't plan
you probably didn't plan your you didn't have a contingency for backlash ah
you didn't you didn't see you you couldn't possibly see right you're just so considered you're so considered right in your
five them ah that you didn't
everybody you know everybody ah has
everyone has skeletons
everybody has skeletons including yourself you know everybody has skeletons but now you make
you make the profession ah you make a living you know by by make a living ah you
earn money eh to feed yourself you know not now I we don't talk about other people ah you feed yourself right with
with
err talking very poorly talking down on people err pointing out people's mistakes and all uh and all that you know
everybody does this you know you know gossipping right
girls gossip also what we are doing now right is actually gossipping ah we're gossipping about other person
but your but I think it's important right that
we have to gossip truthfully you know we have to gossip truthfully
now ah even if we don't gossip truthfully even if we don't gossip truthfully eh
he he puts it online ah he he
in in a sense right he broadcast it he broadcast his opinions his opinions on people and then
look what has happened ah like
most of the singaporean singaporean celebs lah I kind of like hate all of them
the one with the skinny malay guy
ah nicole seah
not nicole seah what's her name
the nicole choo is really not doing anything wrong you know dee kosh eh is dee kosh and
I guess ah uh dee kosh right is really being being a straight up
err straight up douche oh err in a is being a straight up douche ah because
those irritating irritating nonsense eh on err they do irritating nonsense right then they upload it on YouTube
knowingly right post it on social media then everybody were to know
you can go ahead and comment lah but then again when it comes to when it
it's err it's too it's too malicious ah like
it's it's really too it's really too malicious already ah like
err like for me for me right the videos eh
her work probably isn't really that
isn't isn't that great ah because like from the looks of it right she's not really that deep ah to in in all honesty she's not
she she's not that deep ah like the you know
my heart right my heart ah the the abyss that is my heart right is probably is probably deeper ah
that she did right is
she
she kind of like jams
jams YouTube with her shit ah
like I I don't want I don't want to watch this this is this is
this doesn't do anything for me

no
like TikTok and all this you know like I don't get the concept of TikTok you know I get the concept of Vines you know I get the concept of Vines

it is
so I'm an I I'm an anomaly ah
yes

I wonder if like you can really like walk on the rain
hmm
or maybe sing some ariana grande songs you know you never know
eh
but you'll be in a suit
unless the wig is on the suit
oh I know the music video for rain on me
mm ya ya ya ya
but I don't want like the the flying the raining knives
ah
it's really nice
it was like in the beginning
so many times some more
mmhmm how about you
wow
I love black hole
oh it's glowing a bit
so there's like
what is it is it water and
no no don't touch me there don't this is my no no square square
no no don't touch me there this is my no no square
a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world ah these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
reaching yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
ya that what I was thinking
eh
just over there
mm
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also lah
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
ah how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
ah about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time oh wow yet
amazing ah
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
want to stab yes
oh please ah
ya
I can be anything I want
I want to break free
wah what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing
I don't know meh
but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
mm
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be
what do you mean
like a super super power like a superhero
um I don't even have to have a superpower taffy mention
like you don't grow old
oo and just excel in it
that would be cool then like my laptop wouldn't be smelling like matcha now
mm
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers um
mmhmm
transportation eh
sure
it's at the back of my head
teleportation
ya I think I'd rather be I'd rather have teleportation because flying need still need to use energy
but literally we can just teleport anywhere you want
wendy
wizard of oz
might be wanda wanda fairy fairly oddparents
ya
and then she had to tap her legs like
what is one skill that you wanted to learn though
that you always want to learn but you haven't learnt yet
E two
investment
stock
stock trading
why would you want to learn that
but it's so like hectic though
I thought I will get migraine
but you
mind opening
ya
actually I don't know how it works also
but you have to call it and then like someone just get high ya I don't know
that is very fascinating
oo
nobody thinks about
what do I think about your
I think it's a cool skill to learn I'm not sure whether it will be useful
but
it's cool
ya
ya ya ya
that I want to learn
hmm
I feel like I'm quite talented
but I mean
of course there's a lot of things that I don't know also
I want to learn how to
do investments
no really really that's what I really want like I'm I'm very like because I feel like at this age
a lot of my friends are like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it lah basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
I want to grow I want to grow grow grow
a'ah
Enfagrow
combine combine combine combine combine
oo
is it a bear
oo

of course
I thought miss suriati told us

whoa
actually britney spears
ya but like before her meltdown lah because I think right now she's a bit awkward
she's like
sometimes I feel
before the meltdown
princess
ya I feel like she's a good entertainer err
I think she was like like
ee ee
ya like especially when they started young
ya ya like if you started very young then you grow up
feeling very
like empty because you got
everything that you need
ya
ya
now what ya
I mean if I think about it lah it's a good life to live but
ya it's just managing your mental health
true
mental health advocate
but I feel like
the only way you can train yourself to have a healthy mind is to always be open about your emotions and your thoughts
you cannot like keep it inside you once you keep it inside you
a'ah
eww
oh my god
air
it's seriously the worst you already charge me like

a rainbow baby is like a when that baby came after a
another baby died before him hor her ya
so I'm supposed
to have an another older siblings before me after my older brother ya
so does that make me a rainbow baby I guess so
ya
oh rainbow
oh wow
it's true it's true
if I could be a drink I would like to be a teh cino
but I am a teh cino
because it's like sweet I mean it can be sweet if you want to it depends on how you stir the tea so if you stir it well I can be really sweet to you but if you don't stir it well might be sweet at
first but then once nope I could be bitter at first but then once you reach the bottom I could be really sweet
but then if you mix it also the colour the colour of the teh cino is also my colour of the skin

mmhmm

don't know lah
mmhmm
run also
bloody hell
uh oh
favourite
mmhmm
then sing together and start a band
mmhmm of course
I vouch for myself
where should I go
my boyfie
do you have dating ideas date places
huh they still have
when
oh
wow
it's so ugly
what
mmhmm
what
you want to do
far east plaza
ya
nope
but then once you have your you pass license then
pass pass license then get motor
second hand
mmhmm
then I also habis sekolah tired lah so we just relax
yup
cause we're going to meet again tomorrow
afternoon
ya like one
ya
on sunday

and my name is haziqah
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay ah um just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today ah
ya so two more days before friday woohoo and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
oh so you go back to school all the way
wow we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
ah the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
oh I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause ah number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but eh actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having eh a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's uh I don't think that it is uh economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like oh hello good morning like greet them and then um scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so um ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like oh my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues ah they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
eh I don't know eh I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
wow
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like eh well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example lor then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like aww you got a forty seven oh I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on um students uh to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
um and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to um
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics lah so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like eh you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like oh english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue oh and like
oh and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like oh like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like eh you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
um only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena eh novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than err poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into ah mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching um teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where eh you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly what that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like um india or
at any
any colonised um sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce mmhmm scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that lah that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
uh I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this um having that divide you know uh haiti versus the dominican republic
puerto rican
wow
ya lor so
oh also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in jakarta per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their ah ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world leh even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are um there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around um say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them what at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that lah even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like oh it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like oh say like in primary school you don't have like oh you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then uh
I'm tired
stop yawning
wow okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
kaypoh boy kaypoh
mm
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue duh is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds ah cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with gingy though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
mm
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
oh speaking of that right uh there's this tweet saying that uh what ah
uh the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just uh what do you call it ah
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
eh doesn't make sense oh is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like um south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

so how you today nas
oh ya
ya ya ya I I also been watching Netflix lah
oh favourite eh
oh right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no lah
but they still do watch the anime ah
but
err cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
uh september twenty nineteen
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
orh ya
exactly
oh
ah
oh
ah at the sorry ah at the mountain right
oh ya
wah
so
does that mean ah in the future will be a demand also
oh ya
orh ya that one is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six eh wah he's really strong
ya
such coward
wah
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
but but
it really blews me away ah blows me away sorry
ah opening ah
mm
mm ya
ya
it's like err one thing good about anime is like there's no
ah pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
um
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
mind blowing ah legit
ya
ya
ya
um
mm ya
uh one piece
ya
oh ya
not too much
it's it's uh it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
orh ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
exactly cause that's why I I always ah
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for ah films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
ah ya
ah ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
oh ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take oh wait no other than that got physics lah but that's all lah physics should be simpler because this one
its pre-calculus sia what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
oh is it the
the position vector eh
wow
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
ya so err ya that's why exactly but okay lah the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you err encounter like many problem solving ah methods or like
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me ah because one thing um
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with um other people or like
uh actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to ah do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like mm I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
mm
ya
uh ya ya
mm
that sounds
crystallisation thinking eh
wow
mm
mm
uh soft skills that they're born with
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill lah but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
uh your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood lah in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own uh thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you ah in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
uh you you just you don't want to bring up the uh negative uh vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts lah so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
ah ya
mm ya
mm
ah ya ya ya ya ya
mm
ya and and in okay ah in university especially
okay
cannot
huh
mm
mm
ya
mm
drop
mm
ya
orh
oh wow
wow
it's uh it's the same thing for my my school also cause err if I'm not wrong ah is err when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university lah if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but uh if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time um if you are if you have a academic warning already
lesser than two point eight
suspension meaning
ya
ah ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
ah
mm
ah
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam ah
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
oh eh
wah
orh okay I
uh
hmm
mm
mm
huh
oh
ya
but is it mean the same thing
prof oh professor
french
orh is it
mm
oh I
ah
mm
um is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in uh game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is uh user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience ah since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
ah kan so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this uh tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say um enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you ah if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
ah
ya
ah
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness lah
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it uh
they imagine them like eh with this
I I'll look good ah like ah with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
mm
ya
exactly
but I guess um
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
um elon musk eh he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can ah achieve
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
ah if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was err I okay lah when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy lah of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
ah their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
oh ah sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
uh we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to lah
ah ah ya roller coaster
mm ya you have to take a break ah
that's why I feel
uh
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
which is why I also like how um okay lah not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
wow
Marvel is uh huge scale of
all the things that you ah
you imagine it to happen
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero ah but with no actual superpower
orh ya
cool
orh
ah
mm
ya
the black widow and iron man started
mm
oh ya
gauntlet
ya
um assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
you'll feel good lah
make your drive even
uh
higher
so that one err I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
uh good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements ah but in that case also like if you were to think about it ah
now eh ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay lah maybe
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make ah it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
uh it's it's hard ah is the most hardest thing for me
orh
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like ah if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be ah okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
ah ah too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses lah there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
mm can say lah
ya ya
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay lah before
uni ah you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like uh you learn programming all this and that it's useful because ah we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
uh how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
uh good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
ah exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
uh biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
for educational purpose
oh but okay lah cone
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
it's a good it's a
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
ah ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth sia
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years lah give or take
in
oh
ya
strap eh
orh oh ya
probably they
eh eh best sia
oh man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive ah to experience it
persevere humanity to maintain young
orh
ah ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
oh
a'ah akaza
a demon
orh
oh ya
I will still stay young what I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
ah
ah upper moon
ya
same
mm
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live ah eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said um
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
err people who die I don't know ah this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die lah normally
ya
that's humans lah in a way ah that it's a beauty ah like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know lah but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
ah set the bar
ya
ah wrestling or any any person in interest lah like oh
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already lah even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any uh
impact yet
ya maradona
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few uh weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
ah
passing
ah ya ya
it's like it heightens your
ah I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he uh that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film eh or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
ah
exactly
which is why I like anime
stop lah am I at taiwan taiwan at times already ah okay lah hello ah actually ah K bye

mmhmm
mmhmm
my wish ah
my wish
actually
ya
be a good children
then
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
mm ya
uh ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
uh then we find it
err
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
uh actually we can sell anything lah but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
uh
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
um
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals lah to work there
ya so
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
um
mostly is malay food like mee soto mee rebus
nasi lemak
so
mm
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
ya
so uh
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them lah
ya
searching for the suitable space lah first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
err good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mm
because
I
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so it's best either you share everything lah
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
ah
ya
mm
ya
mm
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
meal
meal
oh
meal
mm my memorable meal
well
actually I cannot recall there were many
I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this um same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
mmhmm
smoked duck
uh
was it good
mm but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
err
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya err but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that
ya but
ya
mm
he likes to go for hunting he has a
I don't know what it call the long one
sniper I think so yes
err I'm not very sure how it works
err
you know paddy field
not swan the the very
err slim as
the the tall bird
who who who who the bird likes to stand on one feet
huh
ya but it's not so big it's a small one
that one I tried before
when I was a small child I think
ya that meat was
so I don't have that
err courage
to try
mm um things like I don't know why
meat
ya
err travel you know you can start travelling
yes this one is my this one I'm not it's just now the bear talk it's I mean I mean what I say
yes
mm
um
for me
drama or film
is
is purely an entertainment
I don't mind it's fiction or non fiction
kind of story because
these things are purely for entertainment so you just got entertained that's the purpose of
the visual
right
so I'm okay with any
ya anything I'm I'm okay
ya so I like like
err
short film ah short film
even movie also
okay lah
movie
movie also okay
I'm I also like cartoons
but I like
err shrek
err rapunzel
frozen ya
ya
mm
I think I watch one
I like avatar
yes
really
mm
then I also like twilight
ya
yes
ya
but I like the
actually ah more than I don't know I don't remember exactly the story but more than that I like where it was shot like this was like inside a forest right
ya so I like the background
uh the songs
uh
storyline also
okay lah
ya
ya
huh
prepared to sit and watch but I I it's a a but I like to watch them
uh
I think the most um movie
ya
huh
tobey
ya
err the maybe it's because the first one I watched
mm
mm
ah
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
you mean err
professors doing part time
they have other jobs right
mm
mm
to meet your mentor
who who is your mentor is it a professor
okay
mm
mm
uh
so how do you find your course uh is it you liking it
you mean your your A level friends
mm
your your friends friends who are doing the same course you mean
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
oh they have and all masters and all ah
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
mm
mm
mm
teaching
then
um but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
eh
mm
mm
mm
me
ya
ya so
uh we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know err take our time then
because now err when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
uh and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing eh
have
has my tedious life
mm
ya
so
what lah
mm
ya
free
oh there was err it's err healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill uh and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very uh
you know um
so let's
so that's going to
um make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
um
ah
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
eh common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
mm
mm
master
oh okay
err is with is with a private coach
yio chu kang
yio chu kang or choa chu kang
ya I think yio chu kang or choa chu kang
mm ya
it's err four lessons
mm
mm four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on lah
mm
err I mean uh two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very err
uh so I I I I think I need err more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill lah but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
is it with the equipment
pilates
ah
mm
is it good
just
err
just uh designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
um the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates lah I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
mm
mm
I mean the credit
uh
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
um I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
mm
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
mmhmm
ya
one dish
mm
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast lah
I don't mind
but err only the downside is that
err because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
um
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
uh
ya
fried rice
oh mee hoon tom yum
okay
ah
okay
so how was the rice today uh the mandi rice
the smoke is just like only on the surface
ya
curry
hmm
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best um mandi rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
mm
okay
mm
pizza hut
hey which pizza you ate ah
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
mmhmm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm mm
err tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and ghee rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy lah
let's say you take err one cup of rice
any cups lah
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take um you can make it with the basmati rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you err if let's say one cup of rice uh you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of ghee
you put the ghee
then you slice like one medium size onion
um but the onion you should you should slice err very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
err translucent like a bit brown then you put
err what is the name in english uh
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all lah if you have
then you dah fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
err according to your taste lah
then you cook lah rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version lah there's many kind of
instead of uh instead of
so what's that one and a half cup right
uh
then you put the rice
ah
ya
ya curry chicken lah the best with potatoes
mm
can
no oh it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
I already to
it's not that difficult you just need one
ah onion that's all then the rest
ya you can use the rice cooker
the
pot lah the there is a pot call multi
err what is the name of the pot uh you can cook everything in that pot

okay so I'm natasha and
whoa
the part ya ya ya before we hit the seven mark
yes you break the contract then bye bye
there goes the documentary that we've been planning
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
oh
sometimes I still think about the bunny chow
right
ya I know like legit
so ya we had the bunny chow in
south africa cape town
and it is just
and that was great
why was it great ah I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
oh
mm
poof
ya
is memorable right I think it's like the
ya and the area we were at was like
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
uh huh
a'ah
a'ah
oh ya the customer ya
err I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
I try to remember
ya
the burger right
perbezaan dia memang
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
cause we were given only ah ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
oh
mmhmm
it was basically
right
ya we ate samosa
kan
kan something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
it was the thing
ya
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food lah
mmhmm
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like nata got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like nata look at there but I was driving
no it's not is it a pani
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was um meat there was what cheese
of the full and then we were like ya one one uh beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
a'ah
not
a'ah
ya
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner tau we ate lunch and dinner we ate that one
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
the next day for breakfast
kan
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
like mm
cape town and they also oh it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like oh my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
to be fair they tried to warn us
err speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
ah we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
um the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the it's just the entrance of a
ah
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as bukit timah hill
ya and
it was quite high like
ah in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like eh
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
ya
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
so we entered the wrong entrance lah basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
and I also think
hiking stick
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
ah that that's the plan ah that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
hais
you told her
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
eh but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city lah cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
uh huh
uh huh
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
we we bail out
ah what else
okay how about we start with food
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
um south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
ah the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
oh ya I think cause we were at the coast
ah yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
ah ah ah
you know cause these americans
just just saying
ya and
ish
they not mature yet
ya so like
ya a few and other from right with a few other singaporeans and then
the
ya
woohoo that kind of thing but then we went in like meh we just make new friends I guess in this new
van
a'ah
avoid
ya and not only that we sacrifice one another like sacrifice ourselves
to
ya
ya ya
I think he enjoy it lah
ya I mean got to be fair
he is a bit questionable but whatever
yes
with him never mind don't need
we had fun
ya he's like natasha where's my photos
ya the food wasn't much to say but ya the people
kayaking in the river right
ya I that one I don't think I will forget cause I had to partner with the guy
and then everybody didn't want to paddle next to our boat so everybody just went ahead of us
a'ah
yes
yes I remember
I remember scolding him
okay what else did we do kayak
the reserve
oh my god
the cave
I was just talking about this to my friend tau
you know the other day like it's one of the few things that I will remember for life getting stuck in a cave
hais
I mean to be fair I warn everybody I was like telling them I feel like I will confirm get stuck cause I have no eye-hand coordination
let alone with my legs I no coordination whatsoever so I will I think I will get stuck in the hole
everybody laugh it off
and then what happened
I got stuck in the freaking hole
ya and then at then during dinner I still remember someone like do you that someone was stuck in a cave and then I was over there ya that was me
then she automatically oh really I'm so sorry
ah okay hmm
a cave
mm
the highlight reel
you know hunger games then got the cannon boom
eh
do you want to see another prompt
err if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
oh
oh
ya I mean
it's still considered art
sure
okay
one skill
um
one new skill
hmm
ah I know I want to learn how to ice skate
for no reason whatsoever but just to have fun
I asked
ice
cause kaysa does ice skating
apparently her whole family does
okay anyway ya but like she said I think she said like inline skating is kind of
but I'm still assuming it's a new skill
so ya I mean that will be very fun
ice skate at and then amy amy follow but then amy almost died
so ya I was like ya if I live somewhere
where there's a lake
I would definitely learn and there's winter I would definitely learn how to
ice skate for fun
that be fun
two more skills
ya
oh okay
you'll be like is it dinner time

but okay lah I mean have you been buying clothes recently
oh okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious
ya I know but it's like okay for me is when I buy I will buy like
ya lah I think design sizes it's it's all together mah like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd mm just see which one is um
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon
no lah as in you'll still buy but not as often as before
exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles lah
mm mm
mm mm mm of course ya ya ya
mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya so nobody knows like if you wear this top I don't even know I didn't even remember that you bought it at H&M at melaka oh it's a very comfortable sweater
ya ya I mean if you want I mean I mean it'll be better if we actually left earlier just now lah so you get you get what you are looking for
ya so basically ya if it didn't work if it doesn't work out today you can always bring him tomorrow lah
I don't know because if it's been there and no one claimed it they will also want to remove it in case orh other people want to use the slot and all that
mm ya
very smart boy
mm I mean you can always check back with the doctor lah like is it normal to feel this way
mm mm mm
ah okay okay
oh okay
mm mm mm mm
mm mm
it was at bedok eh not like punggol or something
yay
mm okay okay
okay lah I'm actually quite excited lah looking forward to it cause I don't know what to expect and the I think it's quite been it's been quite a long time since I last had steak
ya I think the last time we had steak was um last year at Elfuego
ya
in december
okay ah
I mean if lah I say and the view itself quite nice mah
okay
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm

mm mm mm
oh serious ah okay
mm mm mm mm
oh okay okay
so they have an office there lah actually
ya it's true

mm
mm mm mm mm understand understand
but there are some states just living in denial
mm
ah natural selection
mm
mmhmm
ah
no no no jail
why would you wanna jail them
you cannot jail people immediately just for that one incident what
ah
you think these people got no money meh to pay
mm
mm mm
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measures lah
ya except when I eat lah
orh
ya so there's there's rules and regulation lah it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
mm
ya must wear in case like people from the other um you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you ah getting that lah
mm
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed oh my god
the below the eyes cannot make it lah ah
okay I don't mind going there
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
uh
then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
arrow at work okay lah it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations
thanks thanks
I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
aha
ah same man
aww
ah
mm mm
ya accept me for who I am
ugh
I'm just saying it works both ways
mm
ya
no they don't talk lah during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
ah so they know how to
ya ya ya ya ah ah
ya
ah
then like and then I'll be like
adela I
ah
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
they also experience bad reception leh and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then kan
ya
video
mashallah
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
mm mm
oi
oh really when
all the best girl
okay
oh my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
oh my god it was painful I was like just
oh my god
ah
feel so hurt
eh but it really hurts ah it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist lah
what do you mean by lube
oh lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that one they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay lah
ya
it depends lah like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
ya ya correct
mm mm
ya so no worry lah I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check err about her the ovaries her uterus
then I was like
and then the lady just the reception's like madam fadilah I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
mm mm mm
ya
mm and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
ah Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
ya
so like then I didn't say lah I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting ah
mm
mm mm
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
eh eh
mm
seventeen
mm mm
I I no okay lah I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya oh my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
then throw outside lah
not strong ah
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
mm mm
ya
orh okay
I mean it's good lah then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball mah that's why
oh my god
oh my god
but it's quite worrying ah I I think it's happening in singapore it's just that we are not
very conservative ah mindset
damn girl where do you get access

ya I I got said already ya
ah it is
compared the zoo they pay more but they and their shift is also slightly shorter lah
err you have a lot of fun lah especially with like your co-workers

so it is good enough for me lah I feel that ah I will prioritize prioritize having money now
ya I guess so I mean
mm
ah
I mean I don't really make a lot of friends in school I mean because of the university ah environment lah like you know people come from different backgrounds and we have different timetables so
we don't really get to see each other that often but I do have one or two few friends lah that I I'm actually looking forward to meeting
and err catching up lah
ya
ah no lah it's my main one lah my main major which is um biological science lah
um
um that
mm mm I I I wanna adventure more into the maritime sector lah and I by maritime you mean the the sea lah
in the future ya
ya
ya
oh
true lah
true
correct correct lah true
ya ya I
we together lah all of us are in a malay club so
ya
so during that
ya commitment issues lah
ya
ah
wah
ya
ya lah ya lah
oh
so ah her malay oral is coming up also so I've been helping her
err with malay oral lah
then err
aside from that
ya I mean the the least I can do is just like be there lah support her and then give her advice
then
ya she she has she seems she seems prepared ah
ya towards the later half of the year lah
same with close to loofy's birthday is it
ah
ya
ya ya nadia tried to err take up err what
the right the arts design and media in
err from the looks of it ah I don't think she got in lah
ya
ah ya the
the something about the diploma I think diploma in teaching
ya kind of sad lah cause she actually turned down her scholarship to try to go for the
ya
ya
ya
mm she's not really interested into like the business kind lah I mean she can do like she encouraged the numbers she can like I think got good numbers lah graphs by by chart tax reform
all those jazz lah ya
ya
I try to
close to that lah similar similar stuff
ya
she will have fallback
ya
ya lah ya ya school starts when ah for you
oh
ya ya my the online semester starts first week of september we having like a welcome ceremony lah on the first of september itself so
it's all virtual lah a bit a bit boring but I mean
ya amsterdam
you know to watch soccer
then you watch people play cricket
true
ya lah not not my not my luck lah
ya
ya
it's getting worse lah in europe area
ya
ya err looking forward to it lah in the future
ah won't be anytime soon lah ya maybe after I get a full time job
after after graduating lah from the university
I almost there lah I feel that already ya
ya
orh
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's err respectable lah for the craft of
ya
mm
ya understandable lah
oh ya ya she she's I think five months
so
time right
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited ah
ya
oh true true
near sharmin's birthday I think
nah who who who I mean
mm government lah they will know that is more than the allowed number ah so
ya it's going to be a small one lah only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
um
ah ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool lah cause they really understands uh their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce ah in the future we work
ah ah ya he's doing fine lah um
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time lah because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during err everyday day to day operations ya
mm
ya ya ya my my dad ah cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed lah beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
cause he's been doing delivery at the site ah to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
mm
ya school fee is quite expensive
mm I think really does a good job lah in ensuring that uh local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years err no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level seh ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five ah
mm
my sorry what
oh my girlfriend ah oh she's she's fine lah because ah she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it lah how ah it's very interesting
so they will err how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
ya ya in that type of uh
effect ya format ya
ah facebook facebook live
then uh she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her uh school of uh
mathematics
err they had a zoom
what they found out from her name ah
ya
I mean ah aren't we all sore losers some days ah
oh uh it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
ah she went out lah with her family cause err
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
I can request lah I mean the idea of contactless kan but
uh I I
I think that's the only choice I have but it'll it'll be terrible lah because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up
so uh
what to do
ya recently err one of your I think last year is it one of your friends graduated also right
there are what what do you got got for her
ya ya that close friend you met on err ya juliana
oh
mm
ya that's right that's right never forget about that lah because that's all you got lah
ya it's nice lah of your parents also
when you were when you were trying to err apply ya for the class

he is uh
he's work during our time before A levels ah
and then we ah
ya
ya usually one month also can apply but you want to apply now also can
mm
ya
it's where it's where is the best ah ya
they will still practice social distancing lah ya
ah
I honestly I haven't really went there because the next week is my first time so
I am looking forward lah to see how they will actually do this ah with the social distancing ya
ya
ya I mean since the the uh now they are trying to promote fist bump right so
ya

stalisha
my day today is very tiring obviously um it's been two days ah I sleep very late
um and so far it's been well um it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring lah
um it's among the home-based sellers lah
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
have their
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
ah ah
customers ah
yes
delivery is
um by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya ah so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight lah hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
um
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
ah I have school I have um freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
ya
go ah because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change lah because I like to bake also
um brownies or cookies something like that
branding
tahbegs tahbegs
ya it's tahbegs is from tahu and begedil but we make it very hipster
so it's tahbegs
ya T H B E G S
oh ya um I also own a small business selling bawals
eh it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be eh next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
um better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
ah because um me and my partner lah
ya we we
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
twenty one
that young
oh
ah
mm mm
mm mm
mmhmm
that's the best you can sleep
oh okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
oh mm ah
mm mm
wow okay
uh uh
mm mm
I you like wrapped
oh okay okay okay
uh uh
uh uh
oh my god
they didn't pay you
oh ya ya ya
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh I see
um
what am I doing at nineteen
um I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
um
there was this
and then um I was very camera shy last time
so I'm like meh like I I don't even bother lah but then my partner saw like eh you should try lah you just try then orh
I said no I don't want err I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the um the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
ah he applied to two ah company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
ah it was an unpaid job
for
um until I was maybe
um nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
um
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like um the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
err when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me lah like oh you need to start
um charging these people because you are having a lot of um
and alhamdulillah it also went well
ah
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
um sell their products ah
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
uh and it didn't work ah
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because ah her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales lah so I was like okay um actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they um they really spread the word and tag you know
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
other companies ya
mmhmm
usually um before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay lah the context ah the context of the post ah we
ya the description we always like um send it
ah on our post
uh it's our post because we are like um ya
usually is like that
ah no that that's the thing that's why I don't um I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like um they told me lah like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
um is very difficult
um and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle lah but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school um there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson um end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night lah something like that
ya it's like it's very bad lah is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up uh my own company ah
um
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
alamak we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
mm
because all of this um of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
um creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well lah and
uh uh
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face lah when I'm opening this um Kamash
um
yes
and
out first what ah ah
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
ah we manufacture ourself
ah no uh we liaise with a factory in jakarta
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
mm
no lah I mean like obviously uh when you grow up
eh
ah my god okay it needs to switch
naturally um
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then ah
some personal reasons lah for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
those type of
incident
car crash eh plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee what
and
ya lah exactly then I was like okay sure
so ah basically ah
so I'm like okay lah since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
um ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor orh an acting
orh okay ah clown doctor
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
oh okay
uh
I can fix my own teeth
mm
mm
wow
ya
oh my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
mmhmm
mm
mm I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
eh the first ya your first show is it
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like wah
well quite nice lor
so
ya
but it was good though
mm
oh I see
oh
mmhmm
ya
mm
ya correct
mm
ya that's that's the thing
um usually people are afraid to set a price
um
we calculate our expenses ah and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see lah um like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like oh we can sell it from this price to this price no uh no lower than that
if it's lower than that um means
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
mm mm
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not chai I don't like chai
oh really
oh I see
ah ah
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
oh my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
oh okay you thinking far
yes
uh huh
oh okay okay okay
I don't know ah I feel like
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
oh ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge um washing machine
wow such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in what and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel

quite sad lah cause you know

it just a game so

for securing that
yes
mm
true true true

one of the scheme oh the
something to do with like mature mature student or something eh

and uh
ya
ya I was at err I was at the and ang mo kio over there ya
ya correct correct
you know drive around the neighbourhood
mm do roundings only ah
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years ah
cause no one from my from my my squad ah actually went to the same ya as me
cause they cause they base you based on your
sorry sorry can you repeat that again ah
err didn't get to hear clearly
mm
ya I would say that central area quite tame mah
ya
whether it's like err important or not ah it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was ah
ya but all in all
okay lah life
valuable lah ya
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
cause
mm
ya correct correct
mm
true true
ya
ya
but oh well that's
it was a good times ah back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish err
I wish I have plans after this ah but sadly I don't
err you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this err my vicinity lah
correct ah
ah
I usually go for a minimum ten ah
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
ya
mm
oh okay okay
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
now I barely need a sip of water ah
ya
ya correct
mm
ya
the
cause if you drink too much then later your system
it's it's it's hampered with already ah so you need to stay stay clean ah
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
mm
ya correct correct
heatstroke ah heatstroke
mm
correct correct
you more vulnerable to heatstroke lah
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
kan
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
mm
ya
well
uh I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages ah but I've been uh
err a good a very good consumer of like err juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice ah yes you as you as you saying
uh I would say at least
two bottles lah
two bottles err five hundred kind ah
of juices ya correct
mm
mm
ah
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
ah okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits ah
mm
wah
wah that's
I think that's err that's the right way to go ah to be honest
ah
oh serious
then
then is the texture smooth
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable lah but
you need to use a
good blender lah
ya I would say that lah
ya
ah
mm true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
um
but as for
err grapefruit
uh those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit ah
ya
so be smooth ah
sorry grape
ya different different
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut ah
mm

happy new year sis
it's okay life has to move on the then what is your resolution for twenty twenty one
mm
but what I mean it it is achievable lah for a year achievable
so for this year because last year is it is a transition for me from a student to a working adult and it's very hard situation actually and I don't think the ya
surprise delivery a'ah
a'ah
ah healthy food
ah
yes that is very good product for your resolution to lose weight
yes you really really should okay
mmhmm
err peanut butter
you have to ask the manufacturer lah
mm mm
mm mm
mm
we will see how
a'ah
ya a'ah
mm mm
mm
err save money kan I think from your resolution to eat healthily and to grow your own food you can actually monetise from that
maybe you can make YouTube channel
how ya how you how you grow your own food from scratch a'ah then we'll see how it grows then from the products that you plant then maybe you can make a channel uh on how to make your own vegetarian food
ya
mm mm
mm
err want it to be
I want it to have plot twist
in a good way
after twenty twenty one eh twenty twenty one ends I have then one hundred percent that I will reach
yes
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup that's nice
because the last year the whole year is me just working my ass off like everyday you know when back in two thousand nineteen I was still a student eh ya I was still a student then
err I have my student life which is very interesting
I
um I involved in so many social program clubs and all
then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
it comes with costs lah which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
err more me time
ah I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time ah
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that ah
I want to enroll in piano class
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not lah not to be like professional guitarist lah no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was err in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard ah and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
mm mmhmm
ya
ah
mm yes I think that is one of the reason kot for the shift in preference to
hmm maybe
but I still I still like to play guitar actually I feel
uh I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first lah
mmhmm
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
mm
oh is it I don't know about that but
um
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them
err instead of english
mm mm
this is good for my networking lah
mm mm
err and
I remember that
err I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
err sadly only one language is err permissible for for for a student err we can only choose one additional language to learn
japanese a'ah
malay english arabic japanese korea
drama and also movies and songs I think that sometimes I can even understand why the actors are saying without me reading the subtitles yes
means really

kan
mmhmm
mm mm
that's true
yes
ah
mm mm
kan
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya I think
for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
uh huh
ah
mm mm
ya mm kan
oh that's very weird but interesting lah
and scary as well
mm mm
mm mm
mm mm
but we have to be careful
cause there are so many bad people out here
ya
mmhmm
mm mm
which is supposed to be secret but you expose publicly like for what
