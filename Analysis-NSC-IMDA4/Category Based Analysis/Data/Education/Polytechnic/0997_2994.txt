nowadays they don't like last time they they <malay>ada</malay> [lah] they got say
all the mean words but now they don't [eh] surprisingly so <malay>macam</malay>
a man of it the toxicity is not as bad as it was before [oh] but then ya and bangkok [lah] stop being a chicken dilemma
not bad not bad

okay [what]
okay the fact that you actually smash buttons I thought you actually did your research but I thought you nailed out on #freya# but okay
[eh] <malay>kirakan kau</malay> natural born gamer [lah] <malay>ini</malay> [oh] my god

what okay [lah]
the rank the rank
rank <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]
actually <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>nak cakap</malay>

<malay>suka</malay> [eh] <malay>mentang-mentang dia dapat asyik asyik menang</malay> [jer] <malay>dapat</malay> increase <malay>kau punya</malay> wing rate and everything (err)
okay [lah] I mean <malay>ada orang main memang macam gitu</malay> so
I'm not judging I'm not trying to do it now but the fact that you already did a lot of research and thing it's a progress you can go up and up and up but
if you want to stay start then okay
win win the chicken dinner
invincible [eh] but if you want play fighter right I feel that okay there's this new fighter called #yu zhong# #yu zhong#
then like <malay>dia macam</malay> dragon <malay>gitu</malay> super cool
<malay>dia punya</malay> actually I've tried before [lah] and
<malay>aku tak bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak boleh main</malay> fighter <malay>apa aku jadi</malay> fighter <malay>macam macam</malay>
like real [seh] everytime <malay>aku jadi</malay> fighter [kan] confirm confirm <malay>aku mati banyak</malay> so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good <malay>macam dia punya</malay> ulti [kan] you basically become dragon
okay [lah] I don't know what's the term [lah] cause I'm not as nerd as you but (um) <malay>jadi</malay> dragon then right <malay>nanti</malay> okay dia actually <malay>kecil</malay> [tau] <malay>dia punya</malay> character <malay>tak besar sangat</malay> then <malay>bila dia lepas jadi</malay> dragon <malay>dia dah</malay> collect <malay>macam</malay> don't know what is it called I forgot <malay>apa</malay> five whatever it's called
whatever
then (um) meet gordon <malay>besar</malay> [sia] <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>dah macam besar</malay> [lah] <malay>besar</malay> ya but I think ya you should play you should play that [one] or
have another fighter [eh] but since you say you play #freya# #freya# right
#freya# #freya# has
I mean <malay>kau pernah main apa</malay> and it's when you play #freya# <malay>bagus</malay> [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good [lah] weren't as good but I think if <malay>kalau kau</malay>
<malay>kalau kau</malay> just keep on go [kan] and <malay>main</malay> more games and practise right confirm <malay>kau boleh jadi</malay> top [sia] hear already knowing how nerd you are
why am I not surprised I am never surprise when it comes to this but
[eh] I really didn't know about the health spinning thing tho
!wah! okay okay cause right there was this like my team that time I play alone then I play with this one person
then <malay>dia punya</malay> #balmond# <malay>bagus</malay> [sia]
legit legit super thick like <malay>macam susah nak susah nak bunuh dia</malay>
and <malay>dia pandai main dia tak macam kau macam dia punya</malay> ulti [kan] <malay>dia tak</malay> hit minion
<malay>dia dia</malay> [tau] <malay>pandai nak</malay> hit so <malay>macam</malay> I get I get it but it's okay I know baby steps baby steps
it's okay you can
<malay>mana tahu boleh</malay>
you can you know improve that that ulti so instead of hitting minion you will hit
maybe three or four player you know
ya then
actually tank right I think <malay>kau pakai</malay> #hilda# <malay>atau</malay> #masha# is good [lah] I mean ya we've talked about it #hilda# <malay>atau</malay> #masha#
yet [eh] #masha# is not a tank #masha# is a is a fighter
ya I cannot tank
<malay>aku kalau aku kalau</malay> fighter <malay>atau</malay> tank <malay>tak boleh</malay>
cause like <malay>aku tak</malay> I'm not the kind to step up [lah] <malay>aku aku tiada pendirian</malay> [lah] [sia]
would you could that the
excuse me excuse me
<malay>paksa</malay> [kan] <malay>nampak</malay>
[eh] !walao! I mean like okay I suck at new new heroes okay so like you know I'm I'm already comfortable with the heroes that I have
so why buy new one you know like <malay>asal</malay> [kan] <malay>kau</malay> satisfied you know you know
ya so it's like
ya [eh] but you know <malay>bila</malay> #hilda#
wait you do know <malay>macam</malay> zoom [kan] <malay>bila dia</malay> speed up [kan] <malay>seram</malay> [seh] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>aku aku nak</malay> initiate <malay>aku macam kalau aku</malay> versus #hilda#
<malay>abeh dia tiba-tiba</malay> speed <malay>belakang aku aku</malay> in the end <malay>aku macam</malay> anxious <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku macam</malay> anxious
[ah]
<malay>sebab macam seram</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>benda besar</malay>
<malay>abeh lari dekat kau</malay> and <malay>macam tiba-tiba tengah</malay> relax relax <malay>dengan</malay> minion <malay>tiba-tiba dekat</malay> bush <malay>keluar benda besar tengah nak</malay> attack <malay>kau</malay>
it went there there there there there it's okay
there there there there there it's okay
lucky <malay>sesat</malay>
I mean it's true sometimes in life nah I don't know what to say cause like I ain't no therapist unlike you
but [eh] but if you play #hilda# or what then I just support you [lor]
but I'll be there okay I'll be there I'll be playing my marksman or my
support [oh] and my angela or my mage [ah] my mage she also actually <malay>aku pun main ganas-ganas</malay>
so like we can tag <malay>senang</malay>
or like <malay>bila kau pakai</malay> #hilda# <malay>aku boleh pakai</malay> #vexana#
ya
[eh] what other what other tank [eh] I feel that #hylos# also not bad [eh]
it's for you
ya #hylos# like ya
ya #hilda# and during
draft pick right they also
they also <malay>itu</malay> [tau] they also ban uranus
ya ya legit legit like they always did
wait I don't they always <malay>suruh</malay>
they always <malay>macam</malay> suggest to ban uranus
or tank just odd [ah] and there's no one who'd ban #hilda#
so I think there's a good chance you can
<malay>kau kau</malay> practise <malay>kau punya</malay> #hilda# [kan] <malay>kasi</malay> work out <malay>kasi dia</malay> buff buff [kan] <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> !wow!
then you <malay>beli</malay> draft pick <malay>ambil kau</malay>
<malay>bantai semua bantai</malay>
but ya ya
they they ban uranus actually I played uranus before it's quite fun but
<malay>pasal aku baca</malay> [kan] <malay>aku tak tahu sangat</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tekan dengan</malay> smash button <malay>macam dengan kau punya</malay> #freya#
so <malay>macam</malay> it's quite fun
<malay>tapi</malay>
okay [lah] but <malay>yang kau aku tak tahu sangat itu</malay> hero [ah] so I have no say [lah] but it's fun [lah] it's just fun to play him
the surprising right they don't really much new players ya they bend your illness because actually you organise is a very thick thing
surprisingly right they don't really ban much new players
they ban uranus
cause actually uranus is a pretty thick tank
like <malay>walaupun dia macam gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>susah bunuh dia</malay> [lah] basically uranus and then they also ban #aldous# #aldous# #aldous# ya and they also ban #helcurt#

so just <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] basically [eh] but but we wanted to go trampoline [kan] so it's like
<malay>kita</malay> rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
ya I wanted to mention that
I was like [eh] <malay>abeh korang pergi</malay> gym <malay>dah</malay> [lah] gym <malay>boleh dua orang</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh aku</malay>
<malay>aku buat apa aku tak nak seorang-seorang aku takut</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>korang nak pergi</malay> gym <malay>pergi</malay> [lah] but then maybe <malay>aku</malay> just I don't know go for a run but
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> that area okay I am not very familiar
pathetic
no I'm not going to do that
container <malay>dia pun bukannya besar sangat</malay> [kan]
so it's like
<malay>apa</malay>
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I <malay>aku pun tak nak</malay> I just don't want you guys to <malay>macam</malay>
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning <malay>leceh</malay> have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning [lah] of course but
the waking up though do you think
you think we will wake up easily
you nasty
okay [lah] if you don't you nasty
okay day two
in the morning we going to prepare some breakfast
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we <malay>mandi</malay> [eh] we <malay>mandi</malay> first then we cook breakfast
okay it doesn't matter the order and then we going to do we're going to trampoline park
after trampoline park we're going to be all sweaty and disgusting we're going to go eat
I haven't do my research on that I ya I'm not as on as you
there's also I found one in #ang mo kio# before but I mean from here to #ang mo kio# is a bit like (um) but ya I thought if [oh] I know I know three one three [lah]
bounce [kan] ya bounce is there I don't know but we'll do research on that
but ya we can go there
[eh] but there's no shower place also right around the area I think we just change our clothes
then I just hope #zat# don't tell us to you know
go back to
you go grab home go back grab
but then like at the same time I feel like I want to fully utilise that
container <malay>macam</malay> you already bought the container [mah]
bought [eh] as in like I don't know [lah] <malay>aku macam nak</malay> stay in the container
ya
[eh] I ya to what as in like you are indeed very correct because why why go out when you can stay in inside a cosy little
container with aircon with all the things you need like
youtube netflix
what why go out okay [lah] I mean okay we're such a
party pooper
ya but
(hmm)
I was speaking of grab I mean coming from someone who reaches
an hour earlier than the meeting time every time
okay you
so it's like I mean I'm not even surprised if your account is not even gold
or silver to be honest or bronze
or below bronze but anyway
I'm so on to stay in container also
but at the same time okay if activity (mm)
if cheap and nearby I don't mind but it's at promenade promenade I don't know it's that far [meh]
the other end is #dhoby ghaut# right [eh] <malay>salah</malay>
okay [what] quite <malay>dekat</malay> [what] actually
I think okay you know what we just see if there's any like places nearby in prom line problem is it depends [ah] okay so the first option
first
first ten
first day
we just
stay inside
second day stay inside third day stay inside that's the first plan second first day we eat
go up and trampoline
go out and trampoline
on the first day I mean okay the first plan right it includes the gym also
because technically we don't go out [what] it's just that we go to the gym nearby the container gym anyway
so that's the first plan the second option is the one <malay>yang itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay>
ya we go outside which is first day we go
we don't we we stay in [lah] we stay in then second day then we go trampoline park then after trampoline park we can go back to the container
I don't know what other activities we can play
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place <malay>aku takut</malay>
<malay>macam busuk</malay>
I mean even if we two car bejewelled and everything we stable soap [mah] like we still feel very icky instead okay ya then
I mean even if we <malay>tukar baju</malay> and everything we still <malay>busuk</malay> [mah] like we still feel very icky and sticky
ya
then
ya or we can go cow play cow moo first or wherever [lah] that first activity that we do and then we go trampoline park
and then we end the day with
going home for going to the going back to your container for dinner or we just buy dinner then we #dabao# to container
bro [oh] my god okay if that's the case then <malay>kita punya</malay> our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's [lor] you can [lah] can [lah] not not so [eh] okay [what] mcdonald's one of the days
