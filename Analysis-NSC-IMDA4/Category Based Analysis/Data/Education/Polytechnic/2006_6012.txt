the sky was so clear it was so beautiful I remember crying

it was super beautiful
ya but some people said (um)
they are away from the problems below
where they are high up you get what I mean
<malay>kau boleh jadi</malay> emirates <malay>punya</malay> [ah] emirates is it emirates
but but my cousin is a
emirates stewardess
<malay>lawa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia</malay>
