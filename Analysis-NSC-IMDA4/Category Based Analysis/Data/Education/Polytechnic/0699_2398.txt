(uh huh)
[ah] yes correct correct
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>abeh</malay>
how how does how does it work
in the new (uh) version
okay
(mm) (mm)
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice [ah] there's no (uh) you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can (err)
do according to your preferences [ah]
[ah] okay so there's no like
four four two
(mm)
(mm)
so in order for me to play
for example #tiki-taka# I cannot have a
(uh) anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my (uh) my formation is flick enough for the #tiki-taka# or
in other formation #gegenpress# [ah] so <malay>tak boleh</malay> just <malay>sembarangan</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference [ah] like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what [lah]
so for the
players also
(mm)
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and (uh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[ah] okay okay okay so
they have their own (uh) attitude [lah] and (uh) they have their own attitude when facing the
[ah] each games [ah]
the what what clubs other than the english premier league <malay>tak ada</malay> logo
(mm)
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
[ah]
so so <malay>apa</malay> (uh) what what what club are you planning to manage
if I'm not wrong [eh] (uh) the last
on <malay>aku main</malay> is that time time poly is sixteen
that's that's long [sia]
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year [sia] last year or last two years
so I [eh] correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be [ah] fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
[oh] the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
[ah] ya
[oh] I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out [ah] so if okay if I am going to download it
[ah] before download it your <malay>kau nya</malay> laptop <malay>macam mana</malay> like what is the specifications cause <malay>aku tak nak</malay>
[ah]
okay
which <malay>apa</malay> brand [ah]
Acer (uh) you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that [one] I think I quite lost already
[ah] K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
NVIDIA (uh) have <malay>semua semua</malay> all have [ah]
okay [lah] so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
laptop <malay>boleh pakai ke tak untuk</malay>
[ah] okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
[ah]
ya I know I know I know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
apparently okay for for for for storage data I have a lot <malay>memang ada banyak</malay> [lah]
I have [ah] eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth [ah]
I don't want jagged jagged (uh) you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
[ah]
[ah]
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also (uh) got twenty touch
[lah] <malay>ini</malay> what's the difference I don't know touch is just for anything that is not computer but also not mobile phone [pe] I don't know why mobile phone cannot work cannot simulate touch although
[ah]
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
[a'ah]
that's a
that's stressful
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people [ah] cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror [ah] [kan] but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
[ah]
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say #ronaldo# #cristiano ronaldo#
okay from #juventus# to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
[ah] okay
[ah]
okay
(mm)
[ah] okay okay okay
okay
so okay [ah] #dortmund# #sancho# is the english guy is it okay okay
(mm)
ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
actually ya <malay>betul</malay> [ah] okay I know what you mean okay so
let's say let's say
this #sancho# is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
okay
this social group is
very important [lah] actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
(mm)
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games [ah]
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
all these is over then maybe <malay>aku</malay> will check it out [lah]
[ah]
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] I don't have I don't have the the the
port for it
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak baru</malay> it's it's quite latest [one] you know it's two thousand nineteen era
but I don't have the LAN cable cause well is more to you know more to notebook <malay>yang</malay> flat flat those [ah]
those [ah] [ah] okay the the reason why <malay>aku ada</malay> this laptop is <malay>pasal mak aku nak buat</malay> you know photoshop and and whatever nonsense [ah]
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
so and that [one] is used to for my <malay>adik punya apa tu</malay> school
which Zoom <malay>pun boleh</malay> lag
no I mean sorry let me be more specific opening Zoom <malay>dah</malay> lag
running the whole thing <malay>nak</malay> type password <malay>dah</malay> you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear [ah] then
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know [lah] I I
[ah]
I I mean I I know about the the the
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother <malay>pakai</malay> you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
(mm)
it is intensive [ah] okay but anyway
okay [ah] maybe after this then I will give it a try [ah]
<malay>nanti</malay> [eh] so
the whole day [ah] <malay>nanti kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kau keluar</malay>
okay [lah] we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
new features with you that I may not be familiar with [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
maybe take a good look about it <malay>tengok-tengok</malay> look
look left look right
look look see see [lah] that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
(mm)
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
(mm)
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the [ah] twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
[ah] so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
[eh] [eh] how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have [sia] god damn it four more days okay [ah] nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine [lah] maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
real good imagine I mean if you maybe look the singapore league <malay>dia cakap</malay>
prime minister #lee hsien loong# announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like #haris harun# still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
[ah] new season [pe] new season they go home and whatnot then how they gonna come back I lost a lot of star player then I got the argentinian guy or whatever his name is in #johor# [ah] ya <malay>takzim darussalam</malay> [eh] #johor# <malay>takzim</malay>
[ah]
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians [pe] is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
(mm)
[ah] I mean
[ah]
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible [pe]
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
[a'ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
so okay [ah]
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see [ah]
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see [eh] when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing [ah]
(mm)
that is <malay>kalau ada orang</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
<malay>apa</malay> nobody give
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
#serie# A <malay>apa punya</malay> guess
(mm)
I mean you can ask #juventus# how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that [one] is their what italian one is it
[oh] okay
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's so
!wah!
ya correct
(mmhmm)
[ah] yes yes
(mm) (mm)
[ah] okay I mean
well that's
actually quite sad [eh] <malay>kalau kau</malay> if you're from the
(err) when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
it be quite you know quite <malay>sedih</malay> [kan] actually to be what to be honest
but [ah] english english wise <malay>takde</malay>
cause there were
(mm) (mm)
<malay>takde tak</malay> I I I've seen the
english <malay>punya</malay> league
there is know the
<malay>cam</malay> the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
even below north south
<malay>ye</malay> from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below <malay>ada</malay> below what the heck I think I think it's
time for them to just you know what
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you know
singapore <malay>ada</malay>
S league delta league don't know what actually <malay>kita ada</malay> [lah] that is why the government decide to dissolve
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] that's why
ya
ya but
I mean ya [lah] I mean that <malay>macam adik aku</malay> every
day
every night [ah] <malay>dia</malay> [ah] he come back from his camp army camp <malay>nanti around</malay>
maybe six plus <malay>dia makan</malay> by seven he will be out
<malay>dengan</malay> member member <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kat bawah</malay> block
then <malay>main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik</malay>
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us [lah] whether he he play in league <malay>ke</malay> he play in what nonsense [ah] cause
I mean technically if everyday
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore [ah] <malay>abeh takkan takkan</malay> [seh] [eh]
<malay>nak main bola</malay> like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
(err) physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger [ah]
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger [ah] I'm the privileged [one] as compared to
whatever it is [ah] but there's a lot of african kid who's <malay>buncit</malay> so I can relate
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
year one year two
year one [eh] <malay>kena</malay> okay anyway [ah]
CISCO CISCO [oh] that's almost seven years
seven years that's <malay>lama</malay> [pe] <malay>aku</malay> poly
bankrupt <malay>aku</malay> wait wait wait
[ah]
<malay>tahun empat tahun pastu</malay> [ah] <malay>enam enam</malay> years [ah] I haven't been playing football actually <malay>lama</malay> [pe]
six seven six seven years I never play
[oh] anyway if you want to know [ah] five aside
no body contact I mean this is the rules and regulation by that [one] no body contact so <malay>kalau nak</malay> tackle
you just [eh] <malay>aku</malay> tackle <malay>kau</malay> okay then <malay>tu bola kau lepaskan</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
I mean that's a good idea [ah]
I mean true
you want to be
[ah]
(mm)
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently [lah] (uh) after army
ya actually true still two years ago at least after army CISCO after CISCO I <malay>dah dah</malay> don't
I don't catch up already cause know
<malay>takde</malay> time you want to sleep more then work
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
spartan the hello universe but then if they are just standing down there looking at <malay>itik ayam kambing</malay>
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say [eh]
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true [ah]
to [ah]
well I mean
like what
how many times <malay>kita</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay>
[ah] ministers <malay>cakap apa</malay> unprecedented crisis
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
(mm)
[ah] ya <malay>aku tahu aku tahu</malay>
but you <malay>minum</malay> how many times you cannot <malay>berbual</malay> tamil [tau]
if you notice
[eh] he cannot speak tamil [pe]
<malay>boleh ke</malay>
then he shouldn't
(mm)
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
nobody dubbed over him [kan]
dub <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] [ah] I mean <malay>kalau kau</malay> I mean if you just say vote for me for example vote for me I also can [ah]
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say #vanakam# for thirty times [ah] for for thirty minutes [pe] I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
in in in that language do you listen in <malay>melayu</malay> or do you listen in
english
of course [ah]
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see [ah] my my
[ah] what's that called [ah] my <malay>nenek</malay> my
grandfather my
basically all the old people [ah]
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me [lah] so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
once you grow old he say <malay>bila</malay> once <malay>dah tua</malay>
[ah] the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
(mmhmm)
okay
[a'ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
okay
ya correct
(mm)
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this (uh)
not say rider [ah] this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
with walking stick like <malay>dia datang</malay>
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from #johor# to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who (um) who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
and of all the language she choose <malay>abeh</malay> luckily she didn't choose
mandarin or tamil [lah] if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent [ah] and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right !wah! this is very confusing [ah]
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true [pe]
malaysian old lady and a old lady in malaysia <malay>apa</malay>
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish [ah] no [sia]
you know you cannot say even you're not even supposed to [eh] <malay>nenek</malay> you want go where no no you say [oh] where you heading ma'am
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
it's like <malay>dok cik</malay> you know it sound so weird know
but
and <malay>dia punya</malay> english is really tiptop [ah] so I I I suspect
I suspect
!aiya! I mean in the first place maybe <malay>ada</malay> the word <malay>datuk kat depan dia punya dia punya</malay>
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
(mm)
so how
[a'ah]
(mm)
okay
then <malay>mati</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh berbual</malay> [ah]
you you agree [pe] okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say [lah] how
[ah]
ya that's why
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
but [ah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah] true
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
when old people ask us [eh] <malay>dah kahwin</malay> [eh] <malay>dah ni dah tu</malay> you answer also they are not gonna listen [pe] they just gonna keep asking whatever we talk they just talk [pe] unless you want to
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian [pe]
okay but you you understand what I trying to say [pe]
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
(mm)
ya
I mean [ah] there there is a I think there's a occasion [pe] there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
wait wait and he and he said multiple times <malay>dia tak nak</malay> interrupt us he don't want to he [pe] he just over here he don't want interrupt us
yet he's always interrupting us [oh] by the way [ah]
<malay>aku nampak dia minum tu kat bawah sini pasal</malay> you know why or not you know why or not
<malay>dia tinggal tingkat lapan</malay> that time that time <malay>aku</malay> that time <malay>aku nampak dia keluar nasib aku pakai</malay> mask <malay>dengan topi</malay> [sia] you know
(mm)
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
then he look at me he and he ask me <malay>nak pergi tingkat mana</malay> hello I mean I'm not trying to be rude or anything
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
<malay>dorang nak pergi tingkat satu</malay>
there's a very high chance I'm not judging I'm not judgemental <malay>ke apa benda</malay>
(err) right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
(mm)
[ah]
okay okay
[ah] coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
I mean technically #asu# [pe] #asu# <malay>terperanjat</malay> [lah] that you
you came in a very quiet manner cause there's is <malay>kau datang</malay> awkward [sia]
<malay>bila</malay>
time <malay>ke</malay>
that [one] for what [eh]
time <malay>aku</malay> <malay>asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kau datang</malay>
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] that is quite long [tau]
ya actually a lot of things changed [ah]
but it's nice
[ah] ya [lah]
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot [lah] I mean it's so so constricted [lah] this place to be honest
<malay>macam</malay> if you're just being stuck here I mean you know how it feels [pe] to be stuck at home
(uh) twenty twenty four seven
like there's no purpose at least <malay>kalau kau</malay> you know <malay>kau gi kerja</malay> there is a purpose I in life
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a [ah] there is a schedule
[ah]
[ah] now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september [pe] you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already [tau]
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
