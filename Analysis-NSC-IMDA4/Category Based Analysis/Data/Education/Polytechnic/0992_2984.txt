<malay>abang kita kena buat</malay> recording <malay>untuk</malay> survey <malay>ni</malay> [kan]
[oh] okay okay can can <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
(um) <malay>kena berbual pasal apa</malay> though like what we
ya I mean movie also <malay>boleh</malay> and
okay K
say that time (err) me and <malay>abang afal pergi tengok</malay> movie <malay>dekat</malay> cinema movie <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] your eyes tell <malay>dia punya</malay> movie is <malay>pasal</malay> is a [ah] japanese movie [lah] so <malay>kita dia punya cerita sedih gila</malay>
so like
I don't know I was just like <malay>tengah nangis-nangis rabak</malay> [lah] but then the <malay>cerita</malay> is about like <malay>satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta</malay> temporarily
and after that
ya like <malay>tak buta mata</malay> [lah] because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
<malay>macam dekat</malay> part of the story was like the guy that <malay>dia suka</malay> or like <malay>macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta</malay> [kan]
it's actually it was was one of the reason why <malay>dia buta</malay>
ya [ah] because of like when he got when she got into an accident the <malay>lelaki tu macam buat benda yang</malay> like
<malay>tak tak</malay> supposed to <malay>buat</malay> [lah] because you know you know
[ah] then after that like it lead her to <malay>macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu</malay>
then <malay>yang paling sedih</malay> part is actually like <malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>perempuan tu kena</malay> undergo surgery [kan] <malay>pasal boleh</malay> actually <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>rawat</malay> [lah] like <malay>boleh</malay> get better so that guy <malay>pasal</malay> that guy <malay>macam</malay> very poor <malay>tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam</malay> you know
<malay>kerja cara</malay> wrestling <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>kerja untuk</malay> like because they <malay>macam</malay> [ah] couple [what]
so like that guy <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>kerja sampai dapat duit untuk</malay> undergo for that girl to undergo surgery [ah]
then after and then after that <malay>bila</malay> like (uh)
ya so because of that rant <malay>dia bagi</malay> like <malay>duit</malay> to undergo surgery then when the surgery <malay>tu</malay> was successful
<malay>dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu</malay> [lah] because he doesn't want to like
<malay>sakitkan hati perempuan tu</malay>
and after that <malay>yang</malay> part <malay>sedih</malay> was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
so actually she was he was
<malay>dia macam</malay> contact later like contemplating whether he should <malay>jumpa perempuan tu balik</malay> or like
<malay>tinggalkan</malay> so <malay>bila</malay> part like
<malay>bila</malay> part <malay>dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena</malay> stabbed
behind
from like this like bad people because <malay>dia dulu kerja memang jahat</malay>
then after that <malay>dia kena</malay> coma for two years [ah]
<malay>lelaki tu kena</malay> coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital <malay>macam orang jaga</malay> then that girl was one of the volunteer
and after that like then after that
you know the thing is like <malay>bila</malay> coma so he cannot talk [what]
so when her ya then ya
[ah] that's japanese <malay>punya</malay> movie [lah] but then <malay>bila</malay> like <malay>sekarang</malay> hospital <malay>tu</malay> then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then <malay>perempuan tu macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni</malay> like
like like is he okay
then like he alleged actually before that he also <malay>macam buat</malay> sculpture
ceramic so he before that <malay>macam</malay> when <malay>dia buta</malay> he she felt the <malay>lelaki muka</malay> [ah]
so and then after that (uh) I think <malay>macam</malay> there was one this music box <malay>yang</malay> reminded of both of them
then after that (err) she own a shop like after she was like okay that she have a eyesight back [ah]
then after that when
one of the <malay>pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang</malay> there's this guy who came in the
<malay>apa kedai</malay>
crying while listening to music box <malay>terus dia tahu</malay> [ah] that was like the last part <malay>terus dia tahu yang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> it was the guy that
he she fell in love with [ah]
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy <malay>kata</malay> (um) you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad [ah] <malay>sedih gila</malay> and after that ya me and <malay>abang</malay> was like <malay>tengah</malay> teared out already then the whole cinema <malay>tengah nangis gila kelakar gila</malay> [seh]
ya it was like really funny but it's like so sad I don't know to me is like sad
but the ending
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense [lah] but then if you <malay>tengok</malay> the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie <malay>yang</malay> like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my <malay>abang</malay> was like are you crazy
ya then he was like are you crazy like !wow! I kept sobbing you know like going out the cinema then everyone was like laughing at me

!wah!
[oh] that's a good [a'ah] [seh] cool
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like <malay>mat salleh</malay>
and then ya cause of the circuit breaker you know cause of the circuit breaker [lah] I don't know why like I suddenly like got like interested and I still remember like few years ago was like I'm not going to like
get into this K pop style of thing it's like
I will not then after that suddenly like this year look at me now
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and <malay>kakak</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> also like watch everyday like at the
and then like at first at first I got like
interested in K drama then after that suddenly now I'm like into K pop [ah] ya I mean
now ya
[eh] but then like thankfully like <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>bapa</malay> is like
they don't really care
no because no that time that time I went home and then
that time I came back home then <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>ibu</malay> was like (um)
what is what is that like at your drawer so <malay>berlambak</malay> album then I'm like what am I supposed to say I thought she was going to scold me then I I was like [ah] <malay>tu</malay> album [ah] then she was like [ah] <malay>duit</malay> birthday <malay>semua pakai</malay>

I I <malay>beli</malay> like I bought there was like
I bought three album for eight dollar
ya that's so cheap then I'm like okay [lah] might as well then after that go like
my group just come back so I bought
a few only then I'm like I mean okay [lah] it's not that expensive so <malay>ni</malay> [lah] I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
[oh]
by the way right then this past few days two weeks
I've been going to like cafe events I told you that
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits <malay>dekat</malay>
I don't know where is it but I's near #bencoolen# and it's like [oh] my god like I would like recommend go there like it's ten out of ten to me it's like
the place is so aesthetic
like the place you really like very nice it's built nice then it's like the food is good
and I also like the event was like fun I just had like I had a really good time that day that day ya I mean there's like three places I've went one is like #oma# spoon
<malay>dekat</malay> somerset
it's like #bingsoo# then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe <malay>dekat dengan</malay>
[ah] #dhoby ghaut# there
but then to me like the best is gather the misfits [ah] cause like this like plus eighty two cafe is like very plain but if you see if you go to the gather the misfits right it's cool you know they got like the fan art thing at the cappuccino something there made
ya and also like
ya and to me like those type of cafes I actually expected to like <malay>lebih mahal</malay>
I thought it will be like twenty dollars or fifteen dollar for just a waffle like waffle like sometimes
no but like I went to like #haji lane# before then
ya [lah] so I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be like that but then the waffles are only like seven dollars so it was like affordable to me [lah]
it's not bad the drinks also like okay I see that
no it's not it's near
I forgot what is it called farrer road farrer park is like near the blue line there I don't know what but you have to walk for seven minutes
ya but then the place is like
I don't think like a lot of people know because it's like
around there is like factory something like that [ah] like it's not like
[tau]
it's not it's not like that it's not near town all that so I guess a lot of people
ya
I want then after that I look at the the plus eighty two cafe right then their event like damn boring then I'm like then then I got like a bit motivated I'm like [eh] maybe in the future right I want to like
I'll open my own cafe
ya [lah] maybe maybe maybe like I don't like
bake and all but I would like open a cafe maybe like in the future with my friend
but then my friend would do like all the baking then I'll just like interior the like design
no [lah] like just interior design like design the place and like maybe do like some admin stuff about it
but then like it's I don't know it looks interesting like if I want to like
start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very <malay>mahal</malay> like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
it's like you know like
it's ya
ya
[a'ah] then <malay>kau kalau</malay> also need to promote then what if like <malay>orang</malay> don't want to come so
ya but then like I like those like aesthetic type of cafes like
cool
<malay>tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap</malay> then that was the problem fit in the cafe
[ah] they just go there to take picture <malay>ambil gambar</malay> aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two <malay>punya ni</malay> like
to me the americano sucks
like it taste sucks man
I don't know maybe I'm just not like coffee type of person [oh] no I don't like bitter bitter stuff so I guess coffee you know like I can drink like coffee much annoy cannot even say ya like the other good [leh] it's like
