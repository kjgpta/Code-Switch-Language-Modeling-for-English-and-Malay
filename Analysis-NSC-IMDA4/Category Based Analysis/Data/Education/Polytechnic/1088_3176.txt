so <malay>mak</malay>
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
why the <malay>sewa murah</malay>
[ah]
[ah] okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
(mm)
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
<malay>makan</malay> hotdog <malay>pun dah marah</malay>
in school <malay>setiap kali</malay> I bring back food then you <malay>marah</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
<malay>itu sahaja</malay> I'm not gonna I'm not gonna explain or elaborate on my three wishes
it's okay I'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
(mm)
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
<malay>dekat</malay> cafe #bedok# cafe <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok#
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
(mm)
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
(mm)
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
(uh huh) paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane [eh]
crane
and
and did you like it
(mmhmm)
(uh) that means <malay>kau suka</malay> [lah] <malay>kau akan cuba sahaja</malay> [kan] <malay>makanan</malay>
don't have courage to try new things
<malay>sebab itu kita selalu bila pergi</malay> india <malay>pergi tempat sama sahaja</malay> [eh] <malay>tak pergi keluar pergi mana-mana</malay>
if I give you <malay>arnab</malay>
okay
okay
so next time <malay>kalau kita balik</malay> india we won't go back to our hometown
go somewhere else
you say [one] [ah]
don't take back on your promise [ah]
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
[oh]
okay
(uh huh)
okay do you have any
(mm)
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar [lah]
then you did did you watch incredibles two
(mm)
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
(mm) <malay>entah aku pun tak tahu</malay> I think twenty twenty three maybe
or maybe <malay>mungkin tahun depan</malay>
ya or maybe <malay>tahun depan</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
then the storyline
or <malay>kau tak ingat</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
<malay>kau ada tengok ke</malay>
<malay>kau ada tengok ke aku tak pernah nampak engkau tengok pun</malay>
which superhero movies have you watched
[oh] <malay>yang hari itu aku bawa kau tengok</malay> [kan]
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
but <malay>dia tua</malay> [kan] <malay>kau suka</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
<malay>yang dekat</malay>
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for (err) (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
and <malay>yang</malay> help them
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
<malay>tengok kalau dia ada apa-apa nak nasihat nak bagi ke atau apa-apa</malay> then
ya then I'll decide then I also need to ask him about exchange about internship opportunities <malay>itu semua aku nak tanya nak</malay> settle
ya
ya <malay>hari isnin nak pergi</malay> then
probably <malay>jumaat balik</malay>
ya but (err) <malay>isnin isnin</malay> I meet my mentor then <malay>hari selasa aku ada</malay> event
in school
then wednesday
wednesday <malay>aku ada apa-apa tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but probably I come back either on thursday or friday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
<malay>macam dia orang</malay> complain [lah] <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay>
<malay>tak suka apa yang dia orang buat</malay> then which makes it very difficult
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
A level <malay>mana ada</malay> civil
you mean from my
no <malay>tak ada</malay> as in I
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different (err)
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
it's a fifty fifty thing [lah] <malay>ada orang suka ada orang tak suka</malay>
then <malay>yang tak suka itu dia orang</malay> struggle
then <malay>yang suka</malay> they they will thrive [lah] so fortunately for me I
I like what I'm doing
(mm)
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
ya they talk they <malay>cakap apa itu</malay> they all said something about how they send their students overseas for like a short period of time to study overseas and all that <malay>itu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> that's why like I said monday I'm gonna go and talk to my profs to find out more information
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
then <malay>cepat-cepat datang</malay> then I <malay>dapat</malay> my
degree <malay>cepat-cepat habis</malay> my masters or
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really like teaching
[eh] teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
!huh! go
after I graduate go
go <malay>belajar beberapa tahun</malay> then
<malay>aku ajar dekat</malay> primary school
okay <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing [lah] and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau selalu duduk rumah sahaja</malay>
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh]
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
<malay>percuma</malay>
anything [lah] ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
okay
okay
okay
(mm) actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
<malay>yang macam kau cakap demam ke</malay>
or the <malay>selesema</malay>
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
like <malay>macam demam ke selesema itu semua</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
so
if
<malay>kalau</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> master three new skills what would they be
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
<malay>dekat mana</malay>
okay right
<malay>jauhnya</malay>
#yio chu kang# all the way

<malay>tengok tengok tengok besok</malay> we will see tomorrow
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring (um) rice we can bring prep rice cooker
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>pernah dengar</malay> I've heard of it before is it is electricity powered right
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) I think you just bring to the room and
ya
ya I I I've seen it before someone cook like <malay>macam</malay> beef rose
or stew
<malay>berapa itu</malay>
ya no [lah] it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say [what] monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
<malay>kena tengok</malay>
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
january to april but which is <malay>kalau aku pergi dekat</malay> january on in january right then I finish school in april I can extend my stay there [what]
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
yes and then <malay>kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan</malay> [kan]
she's working in [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she she no no and then
ya different <malay>dia tak ada</malay> then three years her course was just three years
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
<malay>dia punya bapak beli untuk dia</malay>
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
so <malay>dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana</malay>
ya [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
india <malay>pun ada</malay> north india
<malay>tak nak malas</malay> because very expensive [what]
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
(uh) that one <malay>aku dah</malay> check <malay>semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil</malay>
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries [what]
and then <malay>bawah itu ada</malay> spain I think <malay>semua</malay>
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
so <malay>pergi</malay> or I or I <malay>pergi</malay>
no I don't want go [ah]
<malay>ada orang kita tahu ke</malay> do we know anyone in the
we don't have relatives there
<malay>siapa</malay>
I don't know I think it's something related to
related
ya okay
okay
(mm) okay
right so I think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one
