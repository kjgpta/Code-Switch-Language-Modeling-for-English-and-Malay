like at least advance [ah] cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
taking scraps [ah] from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about <malay>dia</malay> for a bit

I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
[eh] no it should be may it should be may cause this year's <malay>hari raya</malay> was (err) <malay>dua puluh empat</malay>
I remember the <malay>hari raya</malay> was
(err) a few days
after my birthday ya
<malay>dua puluh empat</malay> or <malay>dua puluh enam</malay> I think that was the
that was the official <malay>hari raya punya</malay> date
no [lah] as in just <malay>kakak</malay> was asking me [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay> cause
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like <malay>kasi orang jalan jalan raya</malay> [lah] to her house
like
ya ya ya I I remember is the one <malay>yang abang</malay> #yan# <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>yang abang</malay> #yan# <malay>datang</malay> then he

#nazri#
<malay>suka hati</malay> [eh] <malay>abang</malay> just <malay>panggil orang</malay> gay [eh]
I can tell I can tell that you you
!wow! so deep
<malay>sangat</malay> deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from #shura# and all my other female friends as possible
(mm) no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
<malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sangat ke</malay>
<malay>bagus sangat ke</malay> [ah] (ugh) it doesn't happen in
(mm) (mm) maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
there's <malay>macam</malay> everybody is more free and liberal in
is the liberal [one] is the consecutive
for right okay I know that <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dapatkan</malay> the hostel room right
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
[oh] my god reminds me of the remember when (um)
running man was super big and then running man running man
<malay>yang</malay> the korean <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>yang dia orang taruk</malay> the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
<malay>kejar</malay> them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
like other celebrities have to chase them and <malay>cari</malay> I believe they have to pull the name tag off [lah]
so after that (um)
she like it was very popular so I remember me and <malay>kakak</malay> we were saying that
we noticed there was a lot of (err) people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
#jia hui# #jia xing# eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
but last time <malay>dia punya zaman</malay> also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball <malay>dengan</malay> football T-shirt
I remember (um)
last time we used to have this (err) music teacher <malay>kat</malay> bowen [ah] his name was (err) mister #jamal#
so mister #jamal# he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
like professional <malay>macam</malay>
#trumpist# I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter [ah] I have no idea [lah] that trumpet players [ah] like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world [lah] like he told us that
(err) he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because (err) back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown [lah]
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
<malay>kenapa ni</malay>
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that [ah]
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in (err) chicago [lah]
so he would play the trumpet and then his
(um) his
friend would play the piano
so (err) I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior [lah] who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister #jamal# right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this [ah]
<malay>dia punya</malay> club room he
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts [lah]
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
either he's <malay>kekek</malay> like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
(err) the
like the [ah] because he was wearing those
(err)
football jerseys [ah] like those what cowboys [ah] patriots
okay I know that
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers <malay>punya</malay> basketball <malay>punya</malay> like
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of #kasanaz# I'm sure you remember #kasanaz#
so #kasanaz's# husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer [ah] to the point that
they live in singapore but by right #kasanaz# doesn't need to work
ya so <malay>macam</malay> the husband must be really making serious money [ah]
#kasanaz# is like apparently like got money kind of like girl [lah] but I believe the husband is those
<malay>macam</malay>
chief engineer or something [ah] like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time [ah]
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
#kasanaz# knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that #wei xiang# is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like #wei xiang# first of all right
you and me [ah]
[ah] both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university [lah]
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] like
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
and it's not that there's anything wrong with <malay>kerja kerja</malay> [lah] but
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense [lah] since you like you
you're so <malay>macam</malay>
somehow educated [lah] most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties [ah] who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs [ah]
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the (err) the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in [lah]
so ya [lor]
I believe he's just a cashier
(mm)
supply chain <malay>abang</malay> a job that is quite a big need in singapore
you know (err) he used to intern for supply chain for
exactly so <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
(err) so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company [eh] you intern for like a really
big
(err)
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay [lah] no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip [ah]
those <malay>macam</malay> how they rank the
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also [ah]
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example #temasek# right #temasek# holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance (err) teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with #temasek# then we were like bonds [ah]
you know shares right you can buy like hundred [ah]
hundred shares bonds [ah] you have to like buy by the thousands [ah] if I'm not mistaken so <malay>macam</malay> you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
yes so it's really like you need to have money [ah]
ya
but ya [lah] it just doesn't makes sense to me that <malay>dah dah dah belajar susah-susah</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away [lah] but
it's a bit sad [lah] like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan [lah] the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years [ah] I have [one] [lah]
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money [mah] and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents [ah] cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad [lah] quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what [lah] those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever [lah] so I'm just like
why
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that <malay>mamat</malay> the his boyfriend
the I remember it's quite insane [lah] like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue [lah]
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome [ah]
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
(err)
#wei xiang# was quite a
like not say an advocate [lah] he was quite a
he was quite against <malay>macam</malay> he liked to look down on a lot of this <malay>macam</malay> people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>halal</malay> version of jack's restaurant [lah] there was one at
this at this
it's the steak [one] I remember the there's a <malay>halal</malay> [one] made by this chef then he had a
restaurant at this then #wei xiang# didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists (uh) near the library
yes
I believe it is or it's just (err) something like jack's but it's <malay>halal</malay>
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat [meh] with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no [lah] so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was (uh) didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the (uh) boyfriend was studying [ah] architecture or something [ah]
and then the boyfriend he's (err)
he's got money [lah] he's rich I forgot what the father does [ah]
(err) the father quite strict with the money [ah]
like I remember the father once said that
(err) got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten [lah] then the father got so pissed the father said
(err)
since you on the aircon after ten right (err) [ah] your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
(um) divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
then the mother is back there then he is here [lah] then the father remarried then I think like the father <malay>macam</malay>
I think the father
<malay>dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit [lah] like the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings [ah]
I don't know
I don't know [lah]
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so !wah! talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go #jakarta# one
second thing right they always go #jakarta# on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
#jakarta# right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
#dubai# or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
like <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense [lah] and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from #wei xiang# #wei xiang# told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
(mm) go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money #wei xiang# give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them [ah] but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can [lah] one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no [lah] you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be #dee kosh#
don't prey on kids
seriously #dee kosh# is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
(err) okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
lemon yogurt you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak ingat</malay> [eh]
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew [lah] his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me [eh] #raf# want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called [lah] then he was like [oh] my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking #dee kosh# then I'm like !huh! what you #dee kosh# wants you to model for him [ah] he's like no #dee kosh# wants to suck my then I'm like
[eh] wait wait wait wait wait [eh] you don't anyhow [hor]
then he show me the like the text [lah] so I was like
you're this guy is insane [eh] you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
you don't <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> don't don't <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> your own freaking like
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am #dee kosh# your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like [oh] you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that (um)
like then later on he'll be like [oh] like (err)
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars [lah]
so so <malay>macam</malay> I was telling like him [ah] that
no obviously I don't know #dee kosh# I'm telling my friend that
no so (um) I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal [lah] hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid [lah] there are apps and all these [mah]
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these [lah] cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people [mah] like
no one agreed to this [ah] and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this [ah] so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they they don't want to <malay>macam</malay> speak out against like gay people because like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
like people don't want to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] actually she's a liar and all these ya
it's the same as (uh) you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
[a'ah] the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
a lot [lah] I tell you right all these <malay>macam</malay> people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like #dee kosh# is quite stupid [lah] in my mind <malay>macam</malay>
you're famous <malay>kau</malay> famous <malay>macam</malay> like people know people people know your face then
<malay>kau buat macam gini macam</malay> you want to proposition right don't use your own account [lah]
<malay>pakai macam pakai</malay> fake account [lah] <malay>gini pakai</malay> your own account <malay>macam</malay> you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for <malay>macam</malay> like someone is
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said [ah] is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal [lah] you can't like solicit sex for cash [lah] I believe
that is
wrong [lah] like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong [lah] I don't know how how wrong it is [lah] in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due (err) not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not [lah]
because <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know right is not a good enough (um)
answer to to evict you from like (err)
like
a a sentence [ah] it's like that there was this guy who
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to <malay>macam</malay>
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone (err) he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
(err) with drugs [ah] that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge [lah] he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious [meh] for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough <malay>macam</malay>
it's (err) it's not a good enough (err) like what you call it
defence [ah] the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
so same for #dee kosh# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> just because you you
he the guy never say or whatever right [ah]
doesn't like make it right [lah] you should own self <malay>macam</malay>
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
(err) lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine [lah] like the person cannot say because the person lied [mah]
and the person tricked you into it but #dee kosh# I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that [oh] I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only [mah]
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly [lah] but like people like
influence [ah]
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific [lah] social media influences [ah]
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle [lah]
that's between the followers and them [ah] some people will like [ah] it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and [ah] you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense [ah] like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this [lah] but we don't empower him to do the things he do [mah]
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram [ah] Instagram empowers him [lah] Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things [ah]
nicole #choo#
first of all right there is no <malay>budak zaman sekarang</malay> you and me right are difference by five years only
