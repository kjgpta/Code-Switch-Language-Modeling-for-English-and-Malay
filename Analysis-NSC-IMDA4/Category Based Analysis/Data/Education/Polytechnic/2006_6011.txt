it's nice [leh]
later I'll ask them
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [oh] wait
so (um) <malay>kau tahu</malay> <malay>aku</malay> [kan]
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either <malay>kau buka</malay> computer then like
Zoom <malay>semua kau akan berbual</malay> with your <malay>cikgu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi aku punya</malay> [kan] it's like we talk
no we don't talk like we do assignments so we just have like a few questions like less than five
it's like damn fun because it's like
(um) that one whole week right they don't give like
one assignment
on one day it's like
one assignment like five question like monday until wednesday then that's your deadline wednesday night
so one of our question [eh] sometimes cause
okay our [kan] like intern intern [kan]
so like rarely they know
like about us
so one of their question that they ask
was what [ah]
if you can be any kind of colours what will you be
so what is your answer
ya
why
(mm)
can it's up to you but why
white stands for purity okay then
for your inner soul
<malay>apa</malay> inner soul <malay>kau</malay>
(mm) ya maybe [ah] a bit of both
okay you <malay>kau</malay> guess <malay>apa aku</malay> choose
why blue do I look like a blue
no [oh] my god okay correct answer but <malay>aku</malay> chose orange
okay cause orange [kan] is like more of sunset it's like most of the basic [eh] the main colour of sunset is orange
ya so I just chose orange [lah] at first I don't know but then
<malay>aku cakap</malay> like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange [kan] so <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] like (um)
<malay>aku</malay> chose orange <malay>sebab</malay> it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me [ah] <malay>macam dia</malay> can make my soul like very calming
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay [ah] then end up <malay>aku dapat</malay> five points
ya
serious
I think whoever work like
on air right stewardess
they enjoy like they can see all those sunset and sunrise [sia]
ya
yup true
I want to be stewardess but then end end up <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> so like cannot
actually can
fly emirates
<malay>kawan aku</malay> [eh] no #huda's# sister <malay>yashira dia</malay>
ya <malay>tapi dia sudah</malay> quit <malay>sudah</malay>
she [oh] cause <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> like <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> air stewardess
then she said like go [ah] like try but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like
cause I'm using <malay>hijab</malay> [what] so it's hard
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after <malay>bila</malay> touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know <malay>macam</malay>
you know like you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>pelik</malay> like ya but I really want [sia]
ya that's why <malay>tapi macam</malay>
the thing is [kan] <malay>kalau kau</malay> [eh]
<malay>kalau kau</malay> on the way <malay>kerja</malay> that means <malay>kau tak pakai tudung</malay>
so I think <malay>kalau kau sudah</malay> fly #bangkok# or something then
<malay>bila kau sudah sampai</malay> hotel <malay>kau nak keluar balik</malay> then <malay>kau pakai tudung</malay>
so <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kau punya kawan macam</malay>
they say like [eh] just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume [what] [eh] you use <malay>tudung</malay> you know
it's damn crazy
ya
I don't think I can
like I would rather
have like okay not flexible work but
I don't like that kind of
like <malay>macam</malay> back to back
schedule
my body like need rest
ya
but <malay>kau pergi</malay> #bangkok# <malay>bila</malay>
(mm) <malay>aku</malay>
I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
for temperature screener <malay>dia dekat</malay> #bukit batok# hospital
so <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital <malay>tapi tak ada</malay> aircon
[kan] <malay>pelik dia cakap</malay> like note [kan] <malay>dia cakap</malay> below like for the note they said (um)
<malay>tak ada</malay> aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
so <malay>pada aku macam</malay> hospital <malay>apa tak akan tak ada</malay> aircon
no [ah] but
I never apply <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>nampak sahaja</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[lah] aircon <malay>tak ada biar</malay> like I don't want like I want I need
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan [lah] at least
that time [kan] <malay>aku dapat</malay> okay someone I got
okay not <malay>dapat</malay> like they replied to me
so <malay>aku tanya</malay> like hi is this work still available
then [kan] end up <malay>orang itu cakap</malay> ya okay still have available
<malay>tapi</malay> the thing [eh] it's so annoying like <malay>dia orang cakap ada</malay> available
then <malay>dia orang suruh aku</malay> send resume but then they don't reply to it
so <malay>aku pergi</malay> double text like okay I was being annoying <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>aku</malay> need a job
and <malay>dia orang sudah cakap aku</malay> it's available so <malay>aku cakap</malay>
(um) hi excuse me like so is the job still available <malay>aku</malay> double text [tau]
then after that
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> hi yes (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> hi yes sorry like still have
then <malay>dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja</malay>
(um) <malay>dekat</malay> heat <malay>tak sebab dia macam</malay> open space
so the the open space <malay>macam kot</malay> you know the security guard guard post
okay so
<malay>aku sudah aku cakap</malay> okay ya sure like whatever [lah] I just need the money
then end up <malay>orang itu cakap</malay>
(um) okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
so <malay>sudah aku sudah cakap</malay> yes I'm okay <malay>tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya</malay> like

so <malay>aku cakap</malay> (mm)
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post [what]
so obviously there's fan
so <malay>aku rasa dia</malay> annoyed <malay>macam bila aku macam tanya</malay> like <malay>kalau ada</malay> aircon <malay>ke ada</malay> fan then <malay>dia tak</malay> reply <malay>aku</malay> [sia]
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon [eh]
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan [what]
<malay>tak akan</malay> whoever <malay>kerja sana macam</malay> just <malay>mati</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> heat <malay>dia</malay>

<malay>habis</malay> sarah <malay>pergi</malay> reply <malay>dia cakap</malay>
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
then after that <malay>aisha cakap</malay> [ah] like (um) like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass

like
<malay>dia tak tanya aku</malay> permission <malay>untuk pakai kasut itu</malay> like out of nowhere <malay>aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak</malay>
then after that <malay>aku</malay> text <malay>dia aku cakap</malay> one more time if I see my shoes like this
I will throw your nike inside the water
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> nike [kan] she's very protective of it
so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's <malay>mahal</malay>
then after that (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> I was airing it [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay>
<malay>dia pergi bilang kat</malay> sarah <malay>dia cakap</malay> why #mariam# so rude then <malay>pada aku macam</malay> it's basic [what] it's <malay>kasut</malay> birthday <malay>aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay> after <malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> (err) okay [lah] so from now
(err) you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
the least you can say is sorry [what] like at least <malay>aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap</malay> sarah like
(um) <malay>aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta</malay> permission like bag <malay>dia kenapa macam aku sudah</malay> make it <malay>aku sudah minta kau</malay> permission it's just that <malay>kau macam tak</malay> acknowledge it you know
then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ah] whatever [lah] then (err) <malay>dia cakap dengan</malay> sarah I want to buy shoes so like
(err) #mariam# don't have to like nag then <malay>aku macam</malay> I won't nag if you don't
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
then out of no where suddenly the next day <malay>dia pakai</malay> then <malay>ada kotor lagi</malay> like do you know how pissed I was like
<malay>aku baru cuci</malay> like <malay>sudah bersih habis</malay> like <malay>kau pergi pakai</malay>
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use [lah] but then end up <malay>kau nak pakai aku punya</malay> <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku boleh beli habis pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>beli</malay> like you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so annoying like
(err)
annoying <malay>satu kali itu yang</malay> like these few days like we've been like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) how to say [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
!huh!
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
ya like <malay>macam</malay> these past few days [ah] like me and #aisha# we have like this tension then sarah <malay>satu kali</malay>
(oo) I sense tension then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ha] [lah] <malay>kau</malay> just stop
cause
I I won't say it's okay [ah] but
I don't know [lah] I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay [lor] but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm <malay>nanti balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia akan cakap aku</malay> (err) <malay>pergi buka beg sekolah aku</malay> cause that time I use her bag
confirm [one] then
but then <malay>aku</malay> still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
she won't ask permission for her <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur</malay> so like <malay>aku sudah tanya sudah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> what what common sense is that like I don't get it
no
<malay>aku penat</malay> [sia] rant <malay>pasal dia</malay>
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and #aisha# our shoe size is not that
far [lah] it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just <malay>terjauh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>aku pakai kasut</malay>
(um) merry [eh] <malay>kasut apa tu</malay> doctor mart
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak boleh</malay> fit <malay>aku boleh</malay> fit but it's so <malay>ketat</malay> like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause <malay>aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok</malay> [tau] <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> just
like comfortable
ya <malay>tapi</malay> sarah <malay>punya</malay> is not my size so <malay>bila aku pakai</malay> it's like extra <malay>ketat</malay> and like pain
but then <malay>kalau aku</malay> lose the <malay>macam</malay> the strap <malay>dekat belakang</malay> [kan] then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my <malay>kaki</malay> will <malay>ternaik</malay>
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
<malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>malas nak</malay> go through [ah] the blister blister
<malay>aku punya kasut yang</malay> doctor mart <malay>yang</malay> high cut <malay>dulu itu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi dia</malay> #swee# #swee# [jer] [seh]
[a'ah] <malay>macam</malay> since
<malay>dulu bila aku pakai</malay> like okay <malay>dia macam</malay>
#swee# #swee# <malay>tapi</malay> like there's a little bit of space <malay>tapi sekarang sudah</malay> #swee# #swee# so like
<malay>aku</malay> cannot use thick socks I have to use like
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use [lah] but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak nak</malay> like <malay>kaki aku</malay> blister
like no thanks later will ruin all the fun because I will complain about my blister and all
<malay>berapa banyak</malay> doc mart [ah] <malay>kau ada</malay>
ya
one okay I saw two of it what's the another one
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay okay
[ah] but you rarely use that now
no you can just use it anywhere like go lot
hillion
don't lie sometimes your simple is like <malay>aku pakai lepak</malay> then end up <malay>macam</malay> dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
<malay>macam</malay> rare occasion
<malay>aku pun</malay>
okay now
I just need to find high waisted white
[oh] if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower <malay>baju</malay>
the ones that you always use the high waisted <malay>yang</malay> flair
<malay>yang macam</malay> boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
white white
you have right
ya I think that one can match my <malay>baju</malay> because
okay I have to bring that <malay>baju</malay> to you <malay>sebab dia kat bawah (um) <malay>tali</malay> [tau]
so <malay>kalau aku pakai</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau aku pakai</malay> like normal jeans <malay>kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik</malay>
that's why I need something that is like secured to

ya <malay>dia bukan</malay> skinny <malay>dia</malay> (um) flare <malay>yang macam</malay> boyfriend's jeans kind
you know right

<malay>itu gila babi</malay> [sia] no you know I was like thinking okay cause I am <malay>dulu kat</malay> wattpad
you know the wattpad
they always talk about when they go beach then sometimes they try this skinny dip then <malay>aku macam apa</malay> [sia] skinny dipping
then <malay>aku pergi</malay> check then <malay>aku</malay> check google <malay>aku macam</malay> what is skinny dipping
then <malay>dia orang tunjuk</malay> the results then <malay>aku macam ya allah mata</malay> go where
ya ya
ya but I thought #sentosa# don't have all these kind
(hmm)
ya but some people do that without like
you know being feared of it
same but I don't really like the beach it's so hot
I mean
that's the purpose of it [lah] to go beach getting tan
okay <malay>bila bila kau nak esok</malay>
okay <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] imagine <malay>kita kaya gila</malay> [eh] !wow!
okay <malay>boleh bila kau nak</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] !wow! I I can't imagine like myself being rich
I mean I can be rich like by working hard
but then like <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> you grow up being rich
like you grow up with like a mansion like you don't have to worry about anything
it's so it's so fun
okay <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [eh] what's one topic right
<malay>kau</malay> don't want to talk about
like <malay>macam</malay> sarah right and her <malay>kawan</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> one topic her <malay>kawan macam</malay> don't like to talk about is like <malay>macam</malay> sex
ya but then <malay>aku tengah terfikir</malay> like <malay>kawan aku</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku aqilah</malay> [kan]
she don't like to talk about money
ya <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku tanya aku</malay> [oh] bank <malay>engkau berapa</malay> like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [oh] nine dollar
<malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so flow and easy <malay>tapi</malay> for <malay>aqilah macam kira dia macam berapa</malay> [sia] bank <malay>engkau</malay> like we want check like
cause <malay>kita semua tak nak keluarkan duit</malay> then for #aqilah# [kan] <malay>kita semua diri dekat tepi dia</malay> then <malay>dia pergi</malay> cover [tau] <malay>dia punya</malay> account
<malay>dia punya</malay> that screen then <malay>kita macam berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada</malay> then <malay>aqilah cakap tak ada</malay> [lah] like nothing like not much
cause but I think confirm a lot cause she work as bond
like after her poly then she will work like this company [ah] then they will pay her eight hundred
eight hundred every month like ever since she started her bond so <malay>macam</malay> I think two years already her bond like
<malay>sudah</malay> ongoing
so <malay>macam</malay> confirm a lot then <malay>lagi</malay> her parents <malay>bagi dia</malay> like <malay>duit</malay> allowance
then ya that's one thing [ah] that I realized for #aqilah# she don't like talk about money
but then for my like #syara# and #shak#
<malay>itu aku tak</malay> sure
