[eh] #amshar# I'm doing good [lah] how how about you
you mean great and just
actually <malay>sekarang</malay> so far
what's up [ah] with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life [ah]
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preoccupied with things that we need to do [lah] like like for example
I mean being in army like a lot of things already <malay>sudah</malay> restricted so
naturally we all <malay>sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh</malay> go see our friends and all that so weekdays all <malay>aku pun tak</malay> free then
weekend is the only time I got time [lah] to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of (err) measures that have been imposed [ah] that we need to
you know follow so that you know <malay>sekarang tak tak dapat saman</malay> [kan] ya
you [eh] what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
[oh] ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or <malay>sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang</malay> is it
actually if I'm not wrong now <malay>kalau</malay> wedding [kan] then we can have up to fifty people right
one hundred is it
hundred people [ah] now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
[oh] so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures [lah]
[oh] so <malay>sekarang</malay> means <malay>ikut</malay> shift [ah] <malay>dia punya macam</malay> wedding or like
[oh] cause from what I know is like next week I have a <malay>jemputan</malay>
then I got wedding I need to go to [lah] next week then is
(err) from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about <malay>lima puluh</malay>
people per like per time [ah]
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
the table <malay>sudah nak kena</malay> be (err) separated
then there's no like what intermingling [lah] between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts [lah]
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this [ah] is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially [lah] it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful [lah]
ya
[oh] no serious serious like my uncle's
(err) wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay [ah]
[eh] then that time your I remember you posted something about (err)
<malay>kat</malay> your instagram story right <malay>pasal</malay> (err) the new system
ya that one I'm not
ya
<malay>tapi</malay>
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like (err) a bit of a
contention here right because (uh)
some people say that (err)
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to <malay>masuk</malay> like
or poly or something ya ya
something like that [lah] from that's what I understand [lah] but I haven't really read into it yet [lah] so
if you understand then you can explain a bit [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
okay
[oh]
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
(err) will also affect judging from (err) taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well [lah]
ya
speak
[ah]
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us [lah] especially
(err) cause both of us are going off field and all that then <malay>kat dalam hutan</malay>
<malay>sudah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> signal <malay>tak ada</malay> handphone <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>tak akan nak</malay> check news [kan] I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good [lah] ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly [ah] do you any see do you see any purpose in doing now or not [ah]
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life the life lessons that you learn are social [lah]
<malay>macam mana nak cakap dengan orang macam mana nak apa</malay>
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas [lah]
can or not
ya
like your own circle [lah] ya I I agree with you about that [lah] I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
just give me the opportunity to <malay>jumpa</malay> new people to interact more with (err)
people outside my own social circle and
(err) I got to make new friends [ah] which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
(err) these two years (err)
<malay>tak</malay> wasted [lah] ya I really get to use it to
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya [lah] I mean we all have our different opinions about [lah] but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it [lah] while it lasts ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>kalau</malay> if you ask me personally whether I would
go to or choose to go or not to go
I'd say I think I would choose to not go [lah] because I feel
like (err)
I can (err)
give back more to the <malay>masyarakat</malay>
well when I'm outside [lah] as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
[eh] I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
right I mean <malay>aku masih muda lagi</malay>
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents [lah] now is like the best time for me to after right
(um) you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in cause I can't really
do anything else [lah] ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay [ah] now looking back (err)
it's not such a bad deal [lah]
(mm)
really [meh] you think it will really
help us [meh] like cake
[oh] okay fair enough
yes
(mm)
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I (uh) I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go (err) #amshar# what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say (uh) you're going out with your family
then what are the things like (uh) <malay>kau</malay> guys <malay>kau buat</malay>
what's the activities <malay>yang kau suka buat</malay> like say on a weekend [lah] ya
maybe go to the beach <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>ke</malay>
okay <malay>pergi makan</malay>
I think those kind of places really got the vibes [ah] ya
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you <malay>masuk</malay> camp
you really just feel like (uh) you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones [lah]
ya and especially when you eat home cooked food
I think that's the one [oh] when my mum <malay>masak</malay> you know
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience [lah] then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
like what my family <malay>suka buat kalau</malay> on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is (err) <malay>bila</malay> everyone is
(err) free [kan] everyone got (uh) no plans so we all just go (err) at least have a meal [lah] together
and most of the time (err) my mum will cook and then (err)
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat [ah]
you worst comes to worst is (err)
how you call that we just order in food [lah] if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays [kan]
my <malay>adik</malay> and my mum they're free
so
even though (err) we then we will go out like
(err) walking or cycling [lah] just around the area cause I stay (err) <malay>dekat dengan apa tu</malay> east coast
so <malay>kalau nak pergi</malay> beach <malay>pun</malay> (err) <malay>tak jauh sangat</malay>
ya so
<malay>kalau hujan lebat</malay> then okay [lah] that's when
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore [lah] you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones [lah]
ya
I think for me I like to
make it like <malay>seimbang</malay> you know (err) just have a balance
so betweeen spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me [lah]
ya because friends are what (uh)
has made me like (uh) what I am today for the
how could I say [ah] for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends [lah]
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely (err)
(uh) enjoy spending time with them [lah] ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
<malay>kalau</malay> weekends you think about it you only have <malay>dua puluh empat jam</malay>
so the
timing <malay>yang kita ada</malay> is definitely limited
so it's all about (err) that
what you call that
balance [lah] between (err) spending time with
(err) your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your money how do you spend your money on #amshar#
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
<malay>kalau</malay> anything about <malay>pun</malay> I'm not so afraid to just <malay>bilang dia orang</malay> [ah]
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father [lah] right they talk about
[eh] last time <malay>dulu aku</malay> <malay>papa pun buat ini buat ini</malay> like last
<malay>kalau dulu lagi susah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena</malay> march and don't know what
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation [lah] having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together [lah] like they say it's (err) every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that (uh) helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad [lah] ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
wait I I was also enlisted in #tekong# so <malay>jadi</malay>
my family also <malay>ikut pergi sampai</malay> #tekong# and then they all
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january [mah]
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours [lah]
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
mum and dad <malay>adik</malay> and my [eh] my <malay>adik</malay>
and my <malay>nenek</malay> my (err) <malay>makcik</malay>
what
ya cause (err) I don't know people had extra then they just give me [ah]
so the five of us just went in together then
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> first day [kan]
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so <malay>dia orang</malay> give the best food [lah] that they have
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday [lah] ya
and one of the worst workout days
then [ah] I remember that day !wah! <malay>boleh nangis</malay> [seh]
[ah] first thing I went back to bunk [ah] I just
like !wah! what am I doing
[ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [lah] haven't been so
far away from my family in in awhile [lah] doing something that
I didn't (uh) explicitly choose to do [lah]
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause (uh) we didn't get to at
marina bay you know that whole (err) walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
all <malay>nyanyi-nyanyi</malay> right all <malay>bising-bising</malay>
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that [lah] but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
friends [lah] and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good [lah] then we'd be even closer ya
no ours was ours <malay>dua belas</malay> I think
[ah] the most recent batch they did twenty four
(err) [oh] #changi# food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that (um)
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all [lah] [ah] you finished
ya that nine weeks of then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself [lah]
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training [ah]
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone [lah] bro
[oh] ya ya that's true
(mm)
okay
okay
(mm)
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
<malay>macam</malay> total check my financial spending [ah] and really pen down pen and paper what
I spend my money on [lah] so you know the money that I get I just
think about it (err) the <malay>duit</malay> that I
(err) set aside for <malay>macam macam</malay> transport [kan]
it's already like this much
then after that <malay>kalau</malay> transport there and back cause I don't know <malay>selalu aku</malay> take grab [lah]
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier [what] I mean taking is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late [ah] ya so
what
[oh] the the amount of money I spend on
transport (err) food
and then after that (err) miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
(err)
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets (err) what you call that you don't really think about it [lah]
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want [lah]
so that's when you really need to be more
(err) careful with the where you spend the <malay>duit</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
honestly correct correct (um) [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
slightly more [lah] ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
start <malay>menjimatkan wang</malay> [lah] (uh) especially now that
you're really getting (um)
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes [ah] I understand
like what you said [lah] like when I first got it also I was like !wah! I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
<malay>beli</malay> mcdonald's <malay>beli</malay> what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow [lah] at the start then can go out <malay>beli baju</malay> [kan]
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
(err) I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize (err) actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them [lah]
come on especially right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
now (err) <malay>sebab</malay> all got the <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> the elections [kan]
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now [lah]
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand [lah] maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
(err) a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to (err) trying spending their money [lah] feeling that
I mean trying to (err) not to say like enjoy now [lah]
but (err) saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
cause (err) <malay>kalau</malay> you look at it right now
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future [lah] ya so that we can always (err)
like help our family out [lah] or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others [lah]
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
four [lah] four
ya okay
(mm) ya
ya [lah] [ah] ya I understand where you come from [lah]
[ah] ya
(mm)
I think for for our generation it is like
[ah] no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors [lah]
some of them like <malay>kasihan juga</malay> [lah] you look at them then they're like if they end up
(err) just <malay>buang</malay> all their <malay>duit</malay> during cause they ya our seniors [ah]
all <malay>buang</malay> their <malay>duit</malay> during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
since they're all what you call that [ah]
cause you know that that (err) we have that break routine (um)
when once you then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money [lah] for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
(err) fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
(err) throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job [lah]
ya and I guess the purpose of
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have (err) financial independence [ah]
and really (err) how to say (err) <malay>jaga</malay> your own money
and (um) do what you want with it [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh) yes
ya
ya
I think for me like what you asked just now right (uh) <malay>tadi</malay> you said
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about (um) investing but
(uh) what (uh) I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship [lah] that's something I would like to work towards to [lah]
cause definitely I really don't want to <malay>bebankan</malay> my parents financially [lah] and most of the
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say [ah] they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands [ah]
ya and really just (err) be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out !whoa!
maybe I might even consider signing on [lah]
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's (uh) realistic it's realistic it's worth especially (um)
<malay>kalau</malay> extend contract [kan] <malay>jadi sampai</malay> cause
the idea is that (err) <malay>kalau</malay> we stay longer <malay>kat dalam</malay> camp
(err) you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
<malay>tapi</malay> (mm) <malay>tak tak sedap sangat</malay>
I mean <malay>tak</malay> it's not that bad
ya it's acceptable [lah] ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain [what]
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education [ah] or in my case I guess uni [lah] so
by doing that really
(um) provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we [ah]
I think was about being like (um) financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
like (uh) <malay>tak jadi beban</malay> to your parents [ah]
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
(err) responsible in that particular aspect of their live [lah]
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it [lah] because everyone is (um)
how to say it's not about
(mm) not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to (err)
take your [ah] carry your own weight ya and really (err) feel the sense of (um)
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from [lah] over these past few years [lah]
ya definitely [lah]
can we talk about food now #amshar# please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about and all
<malay>tapi</malay> now
okay <malay>tapi</malay> now I feel like ya let's just talk about <malay>makanan</malay> [ah] really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
ya [eh] so #amshar# [ah] what's your favourite food
!huh!
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
[oh] [oh] scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like [eh] you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily <malay>lapar</malay> or anything
<malay>tapi</malay> it's just a excuse for me to like
(err) <malay>jumpa kawan jumpa</malay> family
no [ah] like it's something that helps me
(err) <malay>eratkan silaturahim</malay> [lah] with people people that
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being (um)
ya for the taste of it [lah] and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any (err) preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
like you say <malay>asalkan halal</malay> I'm steady [lah]
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food [lah]
comfort food
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>kampung</malay> food !aiya! nevermind [lah] bro
#hajjah maimunah# bro #hajjah maimunah# expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
<malay>apa kalau kau beli rendang</malay> right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know [ah] I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is <malay>sotong</malay>
so you you buy <malay>sotong</malay> that time
<malay>bulan puasa</malay> then my family <malay>pergi</malay> #geylang# [kan] <malay>nak makan</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> okay not <malay>makan</malay> sorry <malay>nak beli untuk buka lauk</malay> [ah]
standard [ah] you'll pack away take away <malay>lauk</malay> right
then I remember bought (um)
call that (err) <malay>sotong</malay> right the
<malay>sotong hitam sotong hitam</malay> that was the big squid then it was like what
eight dollars for one head
!wah! that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it [lah] ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
[a'ah]
okay [lah] okay so we're talking wait [ah] so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards #ban mian#
#ban mian#
soup is like really something that !wah! I feel like [ah] #tom yum# also but #tom yum# is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat #tom yum# right the maggi one it just hits different [lah] I think
in my opinion ya <malay>sebab kalau lapar</malay> [kan] a quick fix
would definitely be instant noodles
ya then <malay>sebab</malay> it's convenient
then it's also quite easy to make [lah] then like that I also don't have to what
(err) wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
(err) for sustenance per se but it's all about (um)
looking out for others also
no then I guess that's what can really bring people together also [lah]
ya
okay [lah]
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth [ah]
[oh] swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
[oh] ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
(err) stand in one row right then <malay>semua beli</malay> maggi then <malay>tambah telur</malay>
then the <malay>telur selalu macam tak masak apa</malay> the aunty will say [eh] <malay>setengah masak</malay> but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just <malay>kacau</malay> everything then <malay>makan terus</malay>
!wah! I think now is like really the best [lah]
!wah! is that !wah! then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said [lah] I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
[oh] bulking season bro
ya
ya
#encik tan# #encik tan# bro that's like the go to <malay>nasi</malay>
[oh] ya
I think [eh] two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
then after that it <malay>naik sampai berapa</malay> [eh]
<malay>sampai tujuh puluh lapan</malay> bro
ya it's like I went up by about fifteen or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels [lah] and food was something that gave me comfort [lah]
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
there is no way right <malay>kau boleh belajar</malay> and study at the same time
so right
ya is ya [oh] sorry <malay>makan dan belajar</malay> at the same time sorry
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
feeling [lah] [ah] ya [lah] so
that that that the break time right was really very precious [lah]
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance [ah] but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying (err) the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring [lah]
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
(mmhmm)
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
(mm)
(mm)
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
(um) what you call that there's very remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also [lah]
so <malay>jadi</malay> we had to make do with what we had then
usually <malay>kita beli</malay> what (err) just <malay>nasi campur</malay>
or the <malay>india punya makanan</malay> [ah]
ya so it's like
what we had was what (err) <malay>nasi padang</malay> right
<malay>nasi padang</malay> and the #asagani# stall
[ah] they had they had the only they for the #roti# #prata# which is like not even allowed
[oh] so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
[oh] do you remember when (err) <malay>dulu</malay>
when we used to <malay>beli</malay> the <malay>nasi goreng</malay> first right then we just ask [eh] <malay>ada nasi kway</malay>
<malay>cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng</malay> then she'll be like
[eh] <malay>ada ada</malay> okay okay (err) <malay>jangan bilang orang</malay> then we
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking [eh] bro what's this [ah] what's this then after that
suddenly it's like everyone knew what <malay>nasi goreng</malay> was
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this (err)
honestly it was I think it was a different type of <malay>nasi goreng</malay> I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no <malay>nasi goreng</malay> that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
!hey! it was a super spicy <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
it was like !wah! really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories [ah]
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing [lah] because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
<malay>bulan puasa</malay> bro
ya I mean if you're awake [lah]
that's a
prerequisite
(uh)
[eh] but speaking of food right do you cook
okay <malay>bukannya susah sangat</malay>
ya [lah]
<malay>betul betul</malay> okay understand
[ah] yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like (uh) you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
I try to <malay>masak</malay> [lah] sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got [oh] actually I won't say it's <malay>masak</malay> but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was [eh] that time remember <malay>bulan puasa</malay>
I made (err) (err) <malay>suji</malay> for everyone
ya !wah! that was a absolute (err) logistic nightmare
because <malay>tak boleh agak</malay> how much (err) <malay>ramuan</malay> you need right
and all the <malay>sukatan-sukatan</malay> all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time <malay>buat</malay> then they say [eh]
this one can make forty then come out !wah! twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny <malay>suji</malay> right
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
then <malay>sudah sudah sudah habis buat</malay> then <malay>dia punya</malay> what you call that
when I made the (err) the whole <malay>aduan</malay> right it was a bit
(um) wet
then I have to [oh] (err) ask my mum [eh] what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay !alamak! just add more flour [lah] that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
(err) usable [lah] ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like [eh] actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
(err) know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya [lah] ya [lah]
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control [what]
so when I tried to make <malay>kuih</malay> for the first time that's what happened [ah] then the <malay>suji</malay> came out
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like [eh] why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away [lah]
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun [lah] I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then (err) slowly drop off one by one
and you know (uh)
ya I dodged his mum so I I stay in the
I stay in the east area then this <malay>amshar pula tinggal kat</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> woodlands [kan] <malay>jauh gila</malay> so obviously
<malay>nak naik</malay> train <malay>pun</malay> I took like one and the half hours so
!wah! <malay>memang</malay> but that day <malay>sempat</malay> [lah]
that trip was just for you bro
<malay>sempat sempat balik</malay> #bedok# by <malay>buka</malay> [seh]
cause I left quite late I remember [oh] then I stopped by #ang mo kio# I wanted to meet <malay>tok mat</malay> to pass him the <malay>suji</malay> then he gave me another whole
(um) what you call that a whole container of <malay>kuih</malay> tart in return so
that's quite nice also [lah] ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
what was it [ah] it was [oh] <malay>hari raya</malay> [oh] I was I had leave
cause it was the COVID thing
no no (uh)
ya is no bro is the eve of <malay>raya</malay> bro
ya
and you had your interview
ya [lah]
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the then you're like
[eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] I got interview then I was like [oh] okay [lah] then I go to your house [ah]
<malay>nasib baik</malay> I remember where you stay [sia]
(err) (err) ya
is not bad not bad
[ha] !wah! the things I do !huh! for my friends
(uh)
no [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit <malay>kekok</malay> but but why did the the baking thing was that
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it [lah]
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
<malay>suji</malay> for myself it's just [dah]
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] for me to eat everything [oh] what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two <malay>sudah</malay> a bit <malay>muak sikit</malay> [kan]
so I might as well just give it away [lah] then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still (err) like a blur for me because
let's say <malay>kalau</malay> I'm outside [kan] then I see people <malay>macam</malay>
need help especially older people <malay>naik naik</malay> bus that kind of thing then <malay>angkat</malay> the bag all like go inside right
the thing is (um) how to say this [ah] that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
#paiseh# [kan] because if you think about it [eh] [ah] <malay>memandai</malay> [jer] <malay>nak tolong</malay>
then (err) obviously she understands that <malay>aku pun nak</malay> she understands that <malay>aku pun nak tolong dia</malay> [kan]
but then (err) she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help [lah]
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time [ah] you can't help but
notice that [eh] you're kind of holding up the queue [lah] so
I should probably make you go a bit faster [lah]
but then I (um) feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how [ah]
ya
yes [eh] definitely
(mmhmm)
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
(mm)
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help [lah]
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it [lah] but at the same time that's when you guys come in [lah] when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience (um)
you know that (um)
you have to be sensitive [lah] be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone [lah] especially elderly person
ya [oh] my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat [eh] helping your friends [oh] talk about friends right then you
[ah] then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
[oh] my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
<malay>kalau</malay> the <malay>makanan</malay> [kan] is halal right it will be less
sedap</malay> then if it was not halal
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like (err) more to being (uh) okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like [eh] you're
how how do I say this (mm) like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing [lah] !huh!
cause like let's just say [eh] (err)
let's go eat [ah] #din tai fung# you know obviously that's a no go for me
but then (err) <malay>aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang</malay> right
ya <malay>ambil hati</malay> also then they also <malay>tak nak</malay>
(um) make us feel bad so they will just (err) go to somewhere we can eat [lah]
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's (err) slightly limited [lah]
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
(um) let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
(um)
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go (uh) there's a lot of cheap #ramen# stalls
ya [lah] let's just say #ramen# stalls but they're not halal
cheaper #ramen# stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then !wah! the obviously the receipt be quite expensive [lah]
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
[eh] actually I feel bad <malay>macam</malay> I I don't I
I don't want to make them feel #paiseh# also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they I mean they say don't mind [lah] but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit somewhere there also [lah] but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk [lah] because at the end of the day like [eh] actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not what you call that (uh) but I've no no what's that (err)
[ah] <malay>kari asam pedas</malay> bro that that nestle ice cream container got <malay>asam pedas</malay>
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one [ah]
ya [eh] that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know [ah] there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
but <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you
take to the edit [ah] there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places [lah]
[ah] like okay I meant #bugis# #paya lebar# or #bugis# bro
so many halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
ya but then (err) the my other halal option is (uh) <malay>mamak</malay> [lah]
<malay>mamak</malay> stall [lah] bro supper club
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but I tell you I can't eat #prata# every single day bro
#prata# is not I can't live on #prata# bro ya
(mm) (uh) (mm)
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
[ah] infomercials that's why there's <malay>kalau kau tengok jamaah</malay> [kan] one #suria# and all that
they've (err) they're slightly no update okay it's very obvious
obvious and (uh) they're slightly cringey
(err) what you call that national (err) health promotion board [ah]
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay #jamaahs# right
so obvious [eh] like [eh] [ah] <malay>abang</malay>
<malay>pakai apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>susu biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>tak payah pakai</malay>
(err) coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like [oh] actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it [lah] and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same [lah]
like cause it's still the same dish [mah]
ya and
like what I said it is definitely not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya !huh! so
(hmm)
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of (err) will always comprise of
that [lah] of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but (uh) you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's (err) older right it's definitely something very difficult to
(err) change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages [lah]
ya
[ah] yes yes yes
[ah] bro then when the #teh# O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
[eh] ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
[ha] [ha] I think I see this most often about my <malay>nenek</malay> [lah]
ya [ah] that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food [lah]
so the
ya they they I mean in general my <malay>nenek</malay> cooks everyday
but we only go there every week [lah]
that's when we are all are free [mah] cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend [lah] or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
(err) this kind because like I mean (uh) for
for for starters my <malay>nenek</malay> is quite open to all this also
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool [lah] that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya [lah]
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family [lah] because
[kan] <malay>ada tetamu datang</malay> obviously you have to prepare something right for them
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to [lah] quite close [lah]
but because we <malay>sudah bawa makan</malay>
she prepare less [lah]
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
ya <malay>tak payah susah sangat</malay>
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to (err) weekends is definitely bubble tea [ah]
I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate [eh]
[ah]
[oh] so [oh] you're more of that old school bubble tea [lah] so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
you know we used to <malay>beli</malay> [ah] sweet talk <malay>semua kat bawah</malay> block [kan]
and then got (err) sweet
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
!huh!
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you !wah! you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars [lah] at least
ya only if you use like special discount <malay>ke</malay>
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends [lah] something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely [ah] my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract [lah] you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya [lah] ya [lah] definitely [lah] I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before starts
is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
<malay>sudah tinggal seorang</malay>
okay <malay>kalau sudah ada kahwin</malay> okay <malay>sudah kahwin pun boleh</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak</malay> maggi
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else [lah]
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference [ah]
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you
