he took the power ranger mask and then I was sleeping so I didn't realise it
and when I open my eyes this is small dude was trying to put on the face mask was trying to put the power ranger mask on my face

really
I <malay>ada lagi berapa bulan</malay> [ah] for recontract
march [oh] ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
I know but yours is twenty four months contract but then you took twenty one month so that's three months short if you keep doing that every two years obviously you're short like three it means twenty four months contract <malay>dia dah habis</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> you renew twenty one month so that's three years three months earlier then the next year you do it again earlier three months so that's six months earlier so <malay>dia punya</malay> date <malay>dah lari</malay> [ah] mine could be six months ahead
really
ya but still that's a month apart [what] it's not the same date [what]
I don't know [ah] let me think about it [ah] I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that [ah] which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home [ah] cause the home is a bundled family thing [what]
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
<malay>bagus ke</malay>
<malay>telefon kita ada ke</malay> five G
<malay>telefon kita ada ke</malay> five G
[oh]
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
ya I know so if let's say you were to switch to singtel <malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> ten G then
four G <malay>tu</malay>
but with no sub charges [ah]
[oh] !chey! how sure are you
<malay>berapa dia bayar</malay>
[oh] but you cannot change to singtel
same like #ayim# right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
singtel like <malay>macam</malay> very elite so they like think like they know they top notch so they they like like
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
I feel [lah] just don't like singtel starhub <malay>pula macam</malay> super low quality [ah] it's like
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay [lah]
!huh! I <malay>tak pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> samsung <malay>macam leceh</malay> [ah]
don't say that you don't know though
[oh] my god I remember [sia] <malay>asal</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay>
[ah] <malay>abeh</malay> you <malay>pakai yang</malay> cover <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>selenger</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>padahal</malay> your casing was like no it was because of the heat yes it was because of the heat
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya [sia] it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what [oh] you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course [lah] someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like (uh)
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish [what]
so <malay>macam</malay> they trying to
make the computer understand this language
so they have to keep inputing this language <malay>kat dalam</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> something like that [ah] ya so that's why <malay>dia mesti</malay> like collect <malay>ramai orang gila punya</malay> that one
<malay>punya punya</malay> conversation
I think a lot people are willing to speak for one hour actually it will be very smart of them to just tap on a conversation because it's very hard to talk <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>kena paksa macam sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>tadi kita nak</malay> start [kan] <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay>
<malay>tapi bila kita</malay>
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
#ira# [jer] [ah]

I I don't want to put anymore ill thoughts on #azmi#
(mm)
he's going to [what]
[oh] I'm so afraid that he's gonna lose his job [sia]
he has his tendency of
I think the other parts I'm not so worried for because ya that's true exactly <malay>tu yang</malay> I <malay>takut</malay>
where did you get this idea from
no don't be don't be bullshit that's not true my goal in life was never to be a housewife
#alhamdulillah# okay [lah] I don't think it's any girl's dream to be a housewife okay [lah] there are girls #ira# dream is to be a housewife
ya but #alhamdulillah# ya kind of I think so as in like we never thought that I will be the one who's gonna be a housewife but
not for long I plan to work soon so I am working now as we are speaking this is income
ya it is I mean some money is still money
my money is not off yours so !hey! that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me
<malay>macam</malay> [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> password [eh] <malay>esok nak masak apa</malay> [ah]

I <malay>tak sabar</malay> [seh] <malay>nak gi</malay> #johor# okay [ah] that's true we we don't really follow content kind of person okay anyway <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>tengah tengok</malay> we were watching the news from #al-hijrah#
and then ya mama loves to watch #al-hijrah# <malay>punya</malay> news because the news all like <malay>macam</malay>
no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the (err) <malay>adik ipar pakai</malay> motor <malay>dia</malay> motor <malay>dia hilang</malay>
so <malay>rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi</malay> which is true [lah] <malay>dia curi</malay> [lah] as in without the permission <malay>lepas tu</malay> accident
<malay>adik ipar dia</malay>

then another one more was
[oh] about the <malay>banjir</malay> [oh] then <malay>pramugara buka kedai</malay> it was quite fun [ah] actually when we were watching it
[kan] <malay>macam</malay> so juicy
<malay>besok</malay> thursday [eh]
last
!huh! one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
you <malay>rasa apa jadi</malay>
ya then #rizal# got stabbed then what else happen
<malay>pasal</malay> there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
[oh] ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
(err)
lily give birth with <malay>seluar</malay>
ya exactly so which means #ushu# have to still like be in good terms with them [what]
then I thought #ushu# will <malay>kahwin</malay> the
#rahman# [sia]
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya so complicated and technically he already <malay>lafaz cerai</malay>
when he said that no he put a <malay>syarat</malay> he said that if you go and see your father
I will <malay>ceraikan</malay> you remember
he pull back the <malay>cerai</malay> is it that's what
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house [what]
that's very (um) vague ya
because <malay>talak</malay> will <malay>jatuh</malay> as long as your <malay>syarat</malay> is <malay>tunai</malay> technically <malay>dia punya syarat dah tertunai</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal dia cakap macam gitu</malay> he said <malay>kalau</malay> what did he say [ah] something like <malay>kalau</malay>
you <malay>jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau</malay>
<malay>apa aku cerai apa aku</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
is there really circumstances like this
ya [lah] that's true [ah]
no [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> I <malay>tahu kalau macam benda gini</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> consult <malay>ustaz</malay> because <malay>ni fasakh</malay>
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the <malay>talak dah jatuh</malay> then you have to just reconcile [lah] and say <malay>aku nikah dengan</malay> you know you have to <malay>lafaz</malay> it back [eh] no need to <malay>lafaz</malay> it back but you have to do it with a <malay>saksi</malay> something like that [ah] meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why <malay>yang</malay> that time <malay>ija ibu dengan ayah</malay> he <malay>lafaz</malay> it right then they already back together [what] because #mubin# kept on pestering them back as long as the <malay>talak dah jatuh</malay> they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered <malay>cerai</malay> and they have to immediately consult
<malay>ustaz</malay> or as in like [ah]
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to <malay>angkat nikah</malay> back again
<malay>arwah mak long and pak long</malay> is <malay>cerai cerai</malay> dude
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
[kan] he already <malay>cerai</malay> her [kan] twenty sixteen [kan] <malay>kita kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>ada satu gambar mak long tak ada</malay>
<malay>ingat tak</malay> then <malay>mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita</malay> and then suddenly <malay>pak long</malay> say [ah] okay okay <malay>kita</malay> then he asked <malay>mak long</malay> to walk away then I was just there like !wah! that's mean
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
<malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>satu mengandung</malay> then she complained <malay>kat</malay> twitter <malay>dia cakap yang</malay> every time <malay>kalau</malay> part <malay>dia</malay> share good news <malay>dengan</malay> family <malay>dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian</malay> [eh]
meaning like like <malay>kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak</malay> so <malay>dia selalu ada anak apa</malay> so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it [ah] meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say [eh] I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
(uh) <malay>doa-doa kakak kau</malay> [ah] <malay>yang mengandung</malay> you know
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
!huh!
<malay>tak ada</malay>
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting [ah] as in like they bought themselves a resale
no (uh) ya <malay>tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah</malay>
<malay>tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek</malay> then <malay>nenek</malay> is like saying you know
I don't know [lah] he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand [lah] could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know [lah] I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
obviously he's gonna <malay>nenek</malay> still staying with mama
ya [lah] he's gonna buy it from <malay>pak busu</malay>
<malay>pak busu</malay> bought it at hundred thousandish cheap [ah] so unfair [ah]
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
(mm) ya
ya [lah] true
I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> why ya
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the #de la salle#
<malay>dia nak hantar anak dia</malay> yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year [kan] <malay>anak dia</malay> so two years ya so
five years of course [ah] he's like that what which is good [ah] I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around #choa chu kang# area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works [sia]
#alhamdulillah#
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
#inshaallah# no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block [what]
<malay>tu yang tadi</malay> one of the parents say
ya probably [lah]
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay [lah] also not bad
can he go
ya [lah] that's true
#inshaallah# #inshaallah#
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school [what] #de la salle# is a catholic school
so
[oh] ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else [oh] I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya [lah] that's true see how [lah] I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
[eh] dude
[eh]
what's wrong with that it's good [what] to be prepared
!alah! <malay>dia sihat</malay> for the next few years [jer] [dah] happy
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>nak cakap tadi</malay>
