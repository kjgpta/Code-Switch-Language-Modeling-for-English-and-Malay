(mm)
(mm)
five days
so
[oh]
five days is so long imagine you <malay>sakit</malay> then after that you <malay>kena</malay> five days
!wah!
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay>
you <malay>pernah kena sakit ke</malay>
(uh huh)
[oh] (mm)
stress at work
(mm)
[ah]
[eh] (mm) now got what exhibition over there
!wow! (mm)
but
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tak ada</malay> special queue <malay>ke untuk kita</malay>
[ah] <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>bila</malay> my husband on leave cause <malay>ke sebab sekarang</malay> [kan] december holiday [kan]
so a lot of people (uh) take leave
ya that's true so <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] then government <malay>baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan</malay>
[eh] you redeem already
(hmm)
[oh] go [lah] I see like <malay>ada</malay> staycation then (um) holiday then I saw my friend <malay>kat</malay> facebook [lah] <malay>dia tulis dia cakap dia</malay>
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars <malay>ke</malay> you see [lah] I haven't got the chance to redeem it
[orh]
(mm)
ya [lor] <malay>tapi</malay> complain <malay>cakap yang ini mahal</malay> [lah]
because staycation is known to everyone that <malay>memang mahal</malay> but I think
government <malay>dah kasih duit tu</malay> is good enough
ya that's true
!hais! <malay>susah</malay> [lah] I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go #johor# at least I make a bit more profit
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
malaysia <malay>sepatutnya kasih</malay> singaporean <malay>masuk</malay> I think january but I think <malay>sebab</malay> case <malay>dia orang tiba-tiba naik</malay> I don't think it will come that fast [lah]
(mm)
ya that's true [lah] [eh] you know about talking about government [ah] they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
[ah] then my friend tried it then
the I think the quality got a bit better <malay>tapi</malay> the inside you can actually put the filter
then the <malay>dia punya</malay> outer layer <malay>yang kena mulut tu</malay> is actually very silky so I <malay>tak</malay> sure [lah] <malay>benda tu</malay> really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
well
know
ya <malay>tapi</malay> surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
ya
[oh] <malay>yang apa tu makan dekat</malay> #seoul# garden <malay>ke apa tu</malay> [eh]
[oh] my that one to bring like what the whole family <malay>macam</malay> reunion dinner
ya [lah] but <malay>tapi orang-orang ni pun kena</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga apa</malay> (um) the
<malay>jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>asyik lupa</malay> [jer] <malay>apa nak cakap</malay>
(um) <malay>jaga</malay>
whatever the government say <malay>kena ikut</malay> but the problem is I think <malay>kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah</malay>
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three <malay>pun masih belum ada apa-apa</malay> so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya talking about parents [kan] my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
[kan] the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
<malay>tapi</malay> the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>lagi kat</malay> got orchard then now what <malay>dia orang punya</malay> christmas period I think <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>mesti orang-orang ni mesti</malay> still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
(mm)
(mm) but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country [lah] but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go (um)
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have (um)
enough people it's about
you know <malay>banyak</malay> malaysian <malay>kerja kat sini</malay> [kan]
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless [lah]
they don't have any place to sleep over at (uh) singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that's true <malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>dia orang</malay> come up with some (um) <malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> solution for the malaysian [lah] I heard that they give (um)
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
[oh] [eh] you think [ah] the people who come to singapore <malay>yang</malay> malaysia <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dia orang nak hantar barang</malay> you know like those <malay>barang-barang kita</malay> mostly <malay>datang dari</malay> malaysia [pe]
like the <malay>sayur</malay> like all those foods [lah] you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
daily [ah] (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah! [eh] you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) [eh] you remember or not <malay>yang masa</malay> the first time <malay>yang</malay> COVID nineteen <malay>ni</malay> (um) <malay>keluar</malay> at news then they were asking for people to be <malay>yang</malay> swabbers
[eh] you have any friends working for that or not <malay>sebab dia orang tak</malay> train [kan]
[ah]
!wah! but I think most of these people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> swabbers <malay>ni</malay> maybe <malay>dia orang kehilangan kerja</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(hmm)
[oh]
fifteen dollars per hour
then <malay>apa dia</malay> wear those (um) protective gear
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
expose [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
precautionary order at (mm)
!wah! <malay>leceh juga</malay> [eh] but I really pity those <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> then they have like what two three <malay>anak</malay> to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what (um) home
housewife just like me
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm) I think also (um) government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know [lah] some of us <malay>ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang</malay>
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time <malay>sebab</malay>
they know better [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's true
[eh] [ah] I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
(mmhmm)
!huh!
is
we'll see
(uh huh)
a few cartons
(mm)
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
like losing their mask so <malay>sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang</malay>
(hmm)
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids <malay>tapi</malay> of course it's a added cost [lah] imagine <malay>sekarang berapa</malay> fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
<malay>kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal</malay> [tau]
<malay>satu orang hari-hari pakai satu</malay>
<malay>macam mana tu</malay> very expensive to have a surgical mask
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh] so you don't have plans [ah] for the december <malay>tak ambil</malay> leave <malay>ke</malay> maybe plan outing with your family <malay>ke</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
can [lah] if not you can just order in
(mm)
ya that's true
<malay>sebab iya</malay> [lah] special day [kan] <malay>mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan</malay>
but <malay>tu</malay> [lah] COVID [lah] restricted
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] for me <malay>pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang</malay> [kan] so for me my family <malay>kita nak pergi</malay> staycation
(mm) but it's quite expensive [lah] but
<malay>kesian budak-budak</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay>
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
okay <malay>selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu</malay> (um) then birthday cake then <malay>kalau saya</malay> time
<malay>bulan puasa tu saya sempat</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kuih raya untuk orang yang</malay> order <malay>tapi saya buat untuk</malay> small scale [jer] [lah] [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> government <malay>pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk</malay> family friends only
[eh]
<malay>kalau masak</malay> usually I will just cook (uh) whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like <malay>mi bandung</malay> (um) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> you know those normal stuff <malay>sampai tak tahu nak masak apa</malay>
<malay>betul juga</malay> (um) before this I realised that after the
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu</malay> deprive others [lah] <malay>untuk beli makan tambahan</malay> then you imagine if let's say <malay>gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya</malay>
(mm)
ya <malay>tapi mana</malay> [lah] <malay>orang ni nak ikut undang-undang</malay> so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest [lah]
(mm)
(hmm) ya
[ah] <malay>ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid</malay>
<malay>semua sekarang</malay> online
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle [lah] but lucky he is not using because he's (uh) on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
(mm)
ya that's true
(hmm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched [lah] I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
(hmm)
some of them even went to (uh) try
doing the delivery like grab <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
!wah! it's really you have to work extra hard for this (uh)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
that's long
(mm) maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying (uh) well
(mm)
[oh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then (um) my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of (um) what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive [lah] on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
(um) having that symptom of COVID nineteen
so I think people with (uh) young kids <malay>sepatutnya</malay> maybe could just do something else [lah]
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
[eh] <malay>kita ni asyik cakap pasal</malay> government <malay>aje dah</malay> [lah] <malay>kita cakap pasal makanan pula</malay> [lah] (mm) I'm hungry already do you want to eat
(mm) #prata#
ya ya ya that is my favourite too should we go there
(mm)
[ah] okay [eh] that's the shop so come let's take a seat now
okay so I want
(um)
two #prata#
egg
an then
and one what else [ah] just now you recommend what
[ah] maybe I take the #prata# coin instead [lah]
is the curry very nice
[oh]
[ah] okay [lah] then I take one set of that
(uh) [eh] I saw like they have (uh) <malay>kentang</malay>
can buy one plate for me
okay what are you eating
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
[oh]
maybe I want one
#teh# #peng#
no #teh# with milk and ice
why but it's so hot now I need cold drink to make me feel fresher
[ah]
okay [lah] then I take one mineral water
(mm) no I think that's all for now
[orh]
maybe this will take a bit more time [ah]
[eh] they have this food app that you can order online maybe you can order and then we just sit down and then they will send us the food
have you tried this
(mm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
okay so you ordering or I order
okay can I will just order point coin #prata#
with <malay>kentang</malay> then yourself is
#briyani# chicken fried one
and then water mineral water also for yourself mineral water
okay settled mineral water
okay so the food will arrive in
!wah! fifteen minutes okay
[oh] no they will send to us
ya so because there's table number indicate over here so I just write down our table number ya
(mm) (mm)
but by having this kind of high tech technology [eh] you see for older generation <malay>yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai</malay> app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
that's good
so (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] so how did you get to know about this like how do you volunteer is it through or because I don't see this anywhere
so people like us cannot cannot set up like cannot help
(mmhmm)
[oh]
cause you imagine <malay>orang-orang tua lagi</malay> they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period <malay>dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh</malay> you know do the normal stuff like even going down
[lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's true
cause I think at their age the more they want to be
<malay>keluar</malay> to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage [lah] not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us [lah] <malay>orang-orang muda macam kita</malay>
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
at this point you how do I say [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
you was hoping that your parents or any elderly will know how to use (um) handphone because that is the only communication that you can use especially when you really want to see the other person because but unfortunately most of (um) our parents doesn't know how to use it [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
though
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay>
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau</malay> (um) <malay>mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar</malay>
then
then expose <malay>diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin</malay> #inshallah# <malay>dia orang boleh buat</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli</malay> handphone <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>boleh mereka menggunakan dalam hari-hari yang biasa yang senang untuk</malay>
<malay>mungkin boleh guna</malay> handphone <malay>yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada</malay> handphone ace samsung ace <malay>saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua</malay> not much of (um) they don't have internet access so that's why <malay>nak kena beli</malay> line which is also an added cost
<malay>sebab mereka tak</malay> use internet [ah] data as much as us [kan] <malay>kalau kita</malay> facebook instagram <malay>baca</malay> news (uh) <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai</malay> [lah] <malay>yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini</malay>
(mm) <malay>mungkin</malay>
<malay>ada cara yang lain</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> malaysia <malay>begitu</malay> indonesia <malay>dan ingat tak</malay> hong-kong <malay>baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka</malay> hong-kong <malay>balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada</malay> about other infection case
(mm)
(mm)
ya [oh] <malay>cakap pasal ni saya teringat tentang</malay>
<malay>sambutan hari raya cina</malay>
<malay>saya rasa dia orang pun tak ada bazar</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>sedih</malay> [kan]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau bila dah fasa ketiga dia orang</malay> in <malay>naikkan</malay> number of people to <malay>lapan</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>agak lama</malay>
<malay>saya tidak tahu macam mana sebab saya rasa penat juga duduk di</malay> singapore <malay>sahaja</malay>
(mm) <malay>keluar</malay> especially #bangkok# [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>betul tu</malay>
<malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>saya rasa saya nak buat</malay> staycation <malay>nanti</malay>
(mm)
<malay>betul juga tapi tu</malay> [lah] staycation in singapore very expensive but it's okay end of the year
(mm)
<malay>betul tu</malay>
(mm)
I mean #shiok# [lor]
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau dah buka ke fasa ketiga ramai akan</malay>
<malay>lebih</malay>
<malay>selesa dan tidak risau akan</malay>
<malay>tidak risau dan</malay> also (um)
free [lah] to do whatever they want but of course within that eight person limit
(mm)
(mm)
ya
[eh]
<malay>awak nampak orang yang</malay>
<malay>pakai baju merah tu tak</malay>
<malay>tu macam</malay> safe safe <malay>apa tu saya tak nampak</malay> [lah]
[oh] <malay>dah macam</malay> police ya <malay>mereka</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
!wah! <malay>dia orang dah pusing sini berapa kali</malay>
(mm) <malay>apa tugasan mereka yang patut mereka buat kerana saya rasa</malay>
<malay>kalau mereka pusing sama tempat tapi</malay>
<malay>tak ada benda yang mereka harus</malay> report then
<malay>entah saya rasa macam</malay>
a bit of waste manpower <malay>pula</malay>
(mm)
[ah] [oh] ya <malay>baru saya ingat yang masa</malay> period <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>banyak kedai yang tutup</malay>
<malay>ada berapa</malay> video <malay>yang keluar pasal</malay> auntie uncle <malay>kat luar</malay>
(mm) then <malay>ada yang tak nak pakai</malay> mask <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nasihatkan orang</malay>
(mm)
