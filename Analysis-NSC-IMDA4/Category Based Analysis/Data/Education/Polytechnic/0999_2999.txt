happy family you mean yes
[oh] I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of (uh) you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
I would not say I grew up watching it [lah] how how would I explain it <malay>dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok</malay> drama korea <malay>macam cuma</malay> drama <malay>melayu macam dekat</malay> channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends (um) she suggested me this [one] at at that point of time of the year [ah] the title was boys over flowers
so I I bet everybody knows this so <malay>masa tu macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] boys over
flowers best [tau] <malay>cerita dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya</malay> then <malay>nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni</malay> then I was like
[oh] okay <malay>mula dengar macam</malay> [oh] okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
it brings me back so much [lah] like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like [ah]
they I mean they have a lot [lah] but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
[oh] I like
we watch the same thing ya [ah] kitchen nightmares
[oh] those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's [ah] go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like !wah! like !wah! you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
(err) how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say [lah]
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
like people using fake profiles <malay>macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu</malay> then <malay>orang mesti macam</malay> [eh] I want <malay>tinggi</malay> !wah! <malay>cik lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>buat kawan</malay> [ah] [kan]
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like [ah]

like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
[oh] ya ya ya

[oh] movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one [lah] I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting [what]
<malay>macam dalam dunia ni itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> movie [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [kan] based on
non-fiction [what] so it's like <malay>bila ada</malay> movie <malay>macam gini macam</malay> !wah! <malay>macam dia orang pakai macam</malay> magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like

[oh] no okay okay I know
[oh] okay okay alright alright
yes that is
three hours is because (uh) they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture [what] ya when making movies [lah] but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it [ah] it <malay>dia ada macam</malay> crime crime scene <malay>kat dalam tu</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
how [ah] you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good [what]
!oof! cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
teletubbies <malay>punya patung</malay> I mean I <malay>tak</malay> collect <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is [ah]

[ah] titanic
<malay>mesti sudah tentu</malay> titanic <malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>siapa yang dengar nama</malay> titanic <malay>tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal</malay> [kan] <malay>cerita pasal kapal</malay>
<malay>mesti mesti cerita pasal kapal</malay>
<malay>cinta</malay> !wah! that was the first movie also right <malay>yang</malay> very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting [eh] <malay>yang ini</malay> [oh] I got I got a question for you (um) if you have three wishes what would you wish for
<malay>kenapa tu</malay>
<malay>seorang yang tamak</malay>
(err) it'll be money health and food
(err) <malay>terutama saya suka</malay> I <malay>suka makan</malay> I <malay>suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan</malay> [kan] I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
I mean [kan] it's important in everyday life [what] you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
food also is something like <malay>kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kita boleh macam</malay> explore you can go like
<malay>macam</malay> try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
ya that's just a wish [lah] but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us [lah] as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all [ah] ya [oh] I have another question for you
[ah]
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
(uh) it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind <malay>pasal yang</malay>
<malay>kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam dia diam</malay> [jer] <malay>jadi</malay> if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking <malay>apa dalam minda dia macam</malay> !wah!
I can maybe like let's say <malay>nak buat kawan kita</malay> because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people [lah] if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like [oh] okay <malay>dia ni rasa macam gini-gini</malay> maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind [what] so
ya for me it will be (err) read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean [ah] you know
[ah] food it's always about food [ah] in the end it's always [ah] it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too [lah] what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
I think I mean like that's part of (uh) your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean <malay>dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada</malay> <malay>macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang kecil-kecil</malay> [lah] you know <malay>tapi mana ada yang macam</malay>
and like <malay>tapi apa-apa pun</malay> in the end it's all you know it's all up to you [lah] actually
alright so how about [ah]
K got another question for you okay (err)
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya [ah] okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's true
(mm) I get what you mean
what was [ah] the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like <malay>masuk kedai</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>nak beli baju ni</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>kena bayar tak payah bayar</malay> okay
I mean just <malay>bawa balik</malay> I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] sometimes <malay>kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti guna ke tak tak guna</malay> [eh] <malay>tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna</malay> so
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
(err) [oh] I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found (uh) if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
be a healing process because like you plant <malay>berkebun</malay> I mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tanam</malay> any <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] any <malay>bunga atau pokok yang yang</malay> favourite [lah] [kan] <malay>tanam</malay> then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful (uh) peaceful what do you call [ah] called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
<malay>tanam</malay> maybe like you can <malay>tanam</malay> fruits <malay>buah-buahan sayur-sayuran</malay> I got a neighbour [ah] [ah] my neighbour likes to plant [ah]
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada macam tanam cili padi habis</malay> you <malay>nak cili padi daun kari daun kari</malay> for me it's very common <malay>daun kari</malay> then <malay>ada apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>macam bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>bunga</malay> rose I don't know if it's common <malay>bunga</malay> rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
[ah] ya yes
hobbies actually !wah! hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me [lah]
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
<malay>tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi</malay> I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of (uh) food [what]
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now [lah] I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like [ah] I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies <malay>macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kena bahan ini</malay> [lah] <malay>bahan itu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi nak dia punya</malay> process the process of making it is is very hard [what] so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
I mean it depends on the person practising (uh)
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like [ah]
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff [lah] ya
of course yes
[ah] favourite <malay>lagu</malay> genre genre genre <malay>macam</malay> genre <malay>melayu ke</malay> genre [ah] <malay>sembarang-sembarang apa-apa</malay> genre <malay>kalau apa-apa</malay> genre

(um)
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us [lah] but love at first sight
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight <malay>macam macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>kita jumpa orang tu</malay> first time then <malay>kejar</malay> I'm not <malay>terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta</malay> I mean I
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like [eh] [oh] my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically (uh) ya very interesting how how what what do you think
[oh] I understand K K
[oh] my god okay
[ah] <malay>faham faham</malay> ya ya <malay>ada orang pun fikir</malay>
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people <malay>mesti tengok macam</malay> !wah! <malay>dia ni kacak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam</malay> handsome [jer] [ah] <malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] <malay>fikir-fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> like would you really
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got [ah] another question for you
(uh) [oh] you talk (err) [oh] okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
!alamak! okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau dengan</malay> syrup syrup <malay>limau</malay> ya !alamak! if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup <malay>limau dengan teh</malay> O ice I will <malay>pilih teh</malay> O ice
I mean syrup syrup <malay>manis</malay> I mean I <malay>teh pun manis</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi teh lagi macam lagi</malay> like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting !wah!
yes correct
I would [oh] wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our !alamak! this also very hard [lah] I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting [ah] country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that [ah] from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
