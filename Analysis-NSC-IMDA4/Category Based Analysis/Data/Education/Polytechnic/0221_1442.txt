<malay>nak</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam nak makan</malay> [jer] mango [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal</malay> mango [jer] <malay>macam nak makan sahaja</malay> so (uh) first [jer] <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango
actually <malay>bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam rasa</malay>
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
I don't know if you've (uh) I don't I don't know if any of you <malay>dah pernah dengar ke tak</malay> but
the brand mango <malay>ni memang makcik</malay> I <malay>memang suka pakai <malay>baju</malay> mango this T shirt from this brand <malay>nama dia</malay> mango (err) by the way <malay>ini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> sponsored [lah] [eh] so <malay>kita ya faham-faham</malay> [jer]
okay so what comes to mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango kita <malay>dah berbual</malay> okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay
okay <malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>buah</malay> mango <malay>ini kalau kita berbual</malay> if we talk about the shape we are
it's it's not a definite shape I can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
(um) it's slightly bended it's <malay>bengkok sikit ke dalam</malay> <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok betul-betul</malay>
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
something <malay>macam apa benda ya</malay> shape <malay>dia</malay> so
mango <malay>ini memang</malay> interesting <malay>memang</malay> it's
unique
<malay>selain daripada bentuk dia ini</malay>
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can somehow cut it well in a way that <malay>kita boleh makan betul tak</malay>
(mm) so <malay>kita boleh potong belah dua</malay> we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so <malay>dia macam kotak-kotak gitu</malay> so we can we can eat it like that <malay>atau kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kupas kulit dia</malay> and then <malay>kita boleh makan</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) we slice it we we can just slice the
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
and okay shape it's <malay>memang</malay> irregular <malay>tapi dia macam bentuk yang</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak pelik sangat bila kita makan</malay>
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
(uh) <malay>selain daripada besides the shape
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
about one or two colours so <malay>dia ada</malay> colour yellow <malay>dia ada</malay> colour <malay>oren</malay>
and <malay>dia ada juga</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> so <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>hijau itu</malay>
okay <malay>selain hijau</malay> there's also there's also red <malay>betul tak</malay>
okay so (err) these four types <malay>yang paling banyak kita</malay> like the ones that we see a lot
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
usually the the ones that we usually see <malay>betul tak</malay> so
(err) <malay>yang paling sedap</malay>
I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>yang mana yang paling sedap</malay> because I've only tried
a few types of mango
and yeah
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well <malay>macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so (uh) the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit

dessert
<malay>memang</malay> dessert <malay>paling banyak</malay> have you tried any desserts <malay>yang ada</malay> mango
exactly cause
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] when okay when the colour the colour of the mango [kan] yellow [kan]
it's
<malay>bila</malay> the first thing when you see
yellow
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is <malay>betul-betul</malay> attractive
and
it just draws
my attention to it so <malay>bila nampak macam</malay> colour colour #bingsu# like she said (uh) she mentioned earlier <malay>bila nampak</malay> colour colour #bingsu# <malay>macam</malay>
!ee! <malay>nak</malay> [ah] <malay>tengok macam</malay> the first thing I see is the the

perfect
sunshine [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay

<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]
(um)
(um) maybe <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>kot</malay> maybe that's all we have for mango products (err) I mean
if we're going to talk about <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan</malay> there's definitely mango as a brand <malay>itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu macam</malay>
it's like a brand
<malay>yang</malay> quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
<malay>cuma</malay> word mango [jer] <malay>kot</malay> I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like <malay>macam betul-betul macam</malay> !wah! <malay>nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam</malay>
I guess
that's interesting
okay
(uh) besides that (uh) <malay>kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi</malay> mango <malay>ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay> I feel like [ah] okay but honestly I think (err)
I feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
(hmm)
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean (uh) that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
ya you can do anything you want <malay>dengan</malay> mango cause I feel that
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
we don't really think about
the it's interesting that mango is the topic <malay>untuk hari ini pasal kita</malay> actually <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>kita suka makan</malay> mango <malay>tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal</malay> mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
[oh] my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs [ah] we there's also
mango pudding we always have mango pudding <malay>dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari</malay> mango pudding especially <malay>dekat</malay> wedding
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
<malay>atau dekat rumah kawan</malay>
like at your friend's house <malay>mesti ada</malay> (err)
pudding [kan]
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
because <malay>kita tak pernah</malay> I mean <malay>jarang</malay> [lah] <malay>ya berbual pasal</malay> mango that's what I find it interesting <malay>kalau kita berbual untuk</malay> our first recording <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
about having mango soda
<malay>tak pernah ada</malay> [kan]
do you have have you had any mango sodas
I really wish <malay>ada</malay> mango soda
(um) that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time <malay>kot</malay>
okay
(uh) do you know that (uh) in some parts of the world <malay>dekat luar negeri</malay> some parts of the world <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
the fact that <malay>dekat</malay> southeast asia <malay>dekat asia tenggara kita</malay> actually the king of fruits <malay>ini</malay>
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about (um)
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
<malay>buah mangga</malay>
okay
so besides that (uh) okay the the scientific name [eh] <malay>untuk ini ini buah</malay> is actually mangifera indica
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit <malay>itu macam semacam buah itu</malay> the type <malay>dia nama dia</malay> stone fruit
[kan] (uh) <malay>ada</malay> berry <malay>ada apa apa semua</malay> then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because <malay>memang</malay> if you look at it
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
okay so it means [ah] okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so <malay>dia punya biji</malay> (err) <malay>biji buah dia itu memang besar</malay>
<malay>buah mangga betul tak</malay>
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
okay and mango <malay>itu</malay> actually <malay>juga</malay> native <malay>dekat</malay> india
<malay>dekat</malay> india <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>senang nak cari dekat situ</malay>
(uh) southeast asia <malay>asia tenggara</malay> that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
how interesting is that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>lama gila</malay> [seh] like what the hell
it's way before all of us
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but <malay>kita</malay> go on [jer] [eh]

<malay>betul</malay> I don't know

<malay>cara</malay> you explain <malay>macam</malay> a bit weird <malay>tapi tak apa</malay> [lah] [eh] I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize <malay>kalau</malay> topic <malay>dia macam</malay> lame <malay>sangat</malay> but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
so because this is our first (uh) topic [kan] so
ya no high expectations I'm so sorry
but yes we're trying
okay
now that we (uh) we hit thirty two minutes let's (err) just
take a break from mango topic because (uh) whoever that is going to listen this for one hour <malay>mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>betul tak</malay> so let's hear about your day what have you done today
thank you for asking I know
question <malay>dia tadi satu</malay> question [eh] <malay>tapi dah melalut</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> it's okay
so for my day I today I
okay this week actually is my first week (err) since (err) holiday that school resumes so (err) as per usual I had my class today <malay>tapi</malay> because you know [kan] <malay>sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic <malay>tengah</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> you know like the the virus is you know <malay>masih dekat</malay> singapore <malay>masih ada</malay> cases [lah] [kan] so today we had
for a month actually we have to be (uh) doing classes online
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I <malay>pun dah melalut tak apa</malay> it's okay
I mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
okay back to the topic (err) seriously I think quite sad because <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> [seh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive <malay>dekat dekat sekolah</malay> like my brain my work like [ah] I can just think and do work
like
much more than I can do work at home <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kerja dekat rumah</malay> cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily <malay>dekat rumah</malay> so your productivity level is not as
much as when you're outside
in school especially
I'm sure some of you would feel the same
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that <malay>dekat rumah lagi</malay> (err) productive [lah] but today is (uh)
quite decent for me
nothing too extreme nothing to some <malay>macam</malay> okay okay [jer] [lah] I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive <malay>dekat rumah ke</malay> or is more productive <malay>dekat luar</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> exactly
okay so
now that we've (uh) talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going (err) we're going back to talking about the fruit [lah] [eh] cause
I don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual [lah] [kan] so okay (err) what [eh] what food did you have today

dengan <malay>bihun bihun</malay> [eh] <malay>ke suun</malay>
so
I think it's <malay>suun</malay> this <malay>dia macam bihun</malay> but it's like (um)
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles <malay>yang dari</malay> japan so I think that's what it is then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (um) ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today (um) because you know (uh) work's getting really really stressful <malay>jadi macam</malay> you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then (err) <malay>lepak lepak [dah] itu</malay> [jer]

just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have <malay>jadi macam bila dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god my emotions <malay>semua keluar</malay> but like
that's just what you feel about it
(err) I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so (uh) besides that (err) canon in D [eh] that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
let's talk about the next genre my next genre <malay>yang</malay> favourite <malay>itu</malay> let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between (err) western songs <malay>dengan</malay>
k-pop
they both have very distinct (uh) features they both have
however <malay>macam</malay> similar <malay>dia itu macam sama tapi lain</malay> [lah] you you you get what I mean
<malay>dia punya</malay> upbeat <malay>dia punya</malay> instrumental <malay>semua sama tapi</malay> it's just that the language probably different <malay>kot macam</malay> that's the distinct difference
okay and then (um) my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's <malay>paling banyak lagu-lagu</malay> western <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>kot</malay> that is the one that's very popular
I I would say <malay>lagu</malay> (um)
(uh) <malay>dah lupa tajuk dia</malay>
[ah] I will never let you down by rita ora I think that song is very empowering
besides that okay I I also listen to spanish songs and
[ah] I <malay>tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini</malay> but
it's called #mevoy# M E V O Y <malay>daripada</malay> [eh] the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice <malay>dia</malay>
the the background music has this (um) hum
accordion and I don't know it's just it's just very
it's very cute like when you listen to the song you would think of being in the
feel and what not
okay because we're (err) recording at a very late time because my sister just got back from work so please
just
hold on we still have about twenty minutes left like less than twenty minutes left
everything is going great
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] [ah] [oh] ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I <malay>main asal asal</malay> [jer]
<malay>sebarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is

<malay>dia ada</malay> genre genre [ah] <malay>koplo</malay> [oh] my god <malay>koplo</malay> my favourite genre
it's <malay>dia macam</malay> traditional <malay>gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat</malay>
