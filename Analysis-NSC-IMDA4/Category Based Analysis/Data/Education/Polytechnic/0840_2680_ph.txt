okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber [oh] my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
[oh] my goodness then he was like (uh) then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself !wah! is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping [oh] my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling (uh) #gacha# for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn #gacha# so I can just earn back everything and pull more #gacha#
then another one they
he what [ah] he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
like in that one stream because <malay>kirakan</malay> everyone <malay>dapat lepas geram</malay> [ah] that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want [sia] I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game <malay>tu</malay> [jer] easy game <malay>dapat duit</malay>
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market [lah] that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on #gacha# the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars [lah] at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be #zhong li# that's why <malay>tu aku pun nak</malay> [sia] he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
he's so hot like
(um) what [ah]
(uh) I was gonna say something but I forgot
(uh) [oh] then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is #chihiro yuki# but basically she's her main character is like (uh) this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice <malay>kirakan macam jadi lelaki</malay> [lah] that kind of thing so (uh) then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then <malay>dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu</malay> then they were like [oh] I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back [oh] I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long [lah] but
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like (uh) an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no (uh) fifty thousand yen in is
okay [lah] six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money [lah] but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like !huh! that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot [sia] is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>faham</malay> that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing #zelda# I was like so <malay>kecoh</malay> you know I'm like <malay>aku macam budak bodoh</malay> [sia] <malay>aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu</malay> I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that <malay>bila aku nak aku nak</malay> cancel [kan] <malay>aku lupa nak</malay> cancel then instead I press the left side <malay>dia nya</malay> down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night <malay>macam budak bodoh</malay> [sia] I died so many times while playing that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
<malay>lagipun</malay> you <malay>main</malay> you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay [lah] my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd [lah] I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu</malay> like the the white <malay>punya</malay> platform <malay>itu</malay> then I look at the thing then I'm like [eh] <malay>aku berat</malay> [ah] [sia] then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what [ah]
(uh) shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that [one] !wah! that [one] is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
(uh) I don't know [ah] I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my <malay>mak nak pergi masjid</malay> so she had to drop me off there [ah] then she was then [oh] my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then (um) ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because [eh] he quite handsome and his power quite cool
[ah] I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey #kong# and he has never failed to turn up with every single [eh] this company [lah] this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver [ah] I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey #kong# in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on #gacha# he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey #kong's# the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title [oh] I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
[oh] serious [ah] <malay>dia orang belum</malay> like you <malay>beli kat mana</malay> Shopee
I think you try <malay>dahulu kalau dia orang tak</malay> reply <malay>baru</malay> send email
serious <malay>masih belum</malay>
it's <malay>kat</malay> Carousell or what
[ah] (uh) did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that [lah]
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
BTOB !huh! BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like #changsub# and #eunkwang# just got like (uh) they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on <malay>bodoh</malay> it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
<malay>dia orang pakai macam apa tu yang</malay>
it's it's like those body tight suits then #changsub# <malay>pakai yang</malay> gold then #eunkwang# <malay>pakai</malay> yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind <malay>cuma muka dia orang</malay> [jer] <malay>boleh nampak</malay> and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay [lah] admittedly now is a bit more classy <malay>dia orang pakai macam</malay> like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so <malay>bodoh</malay> but okay [lah] I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before #changsub# enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing [ah] so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that [one] was damn funny the video with the band members <malay>dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu merepek</malay> [sia] but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
<malay>tapi dia orang punya army macam best</malay> [jer]
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
like the concert I remember #eunkwang# was inside [one] like <malay>dia orang masuk</malay> army <malay>buat</malay> <malay>ke [pe] ke dia orang tengah buat</malay> some musical school or what [sia] I don't get it <malay>dia orang ada</malay> military band [lah] <malay>buat</malay> performance <malay>sini</malay> performance <malay>sana dia orang buat</malay> parade <malay>abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati</malay> [sia]
you
like
discharged
!huh! serious
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april <malay>tapi dia dah dapat</malay>
I'm <malay>aku aku pun tak tahu</malay> [sia] I have one friend who cause <malay>dorang ada</malay> I cannot I don't
#alhamdulillah# I don't know if it's the right
term but
he got an offer to join like <malay>dia orangnya</malay> commando training or something like that it's like <malay>macam</malay>
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but <malay>macam lebih dia orangnya</malay> fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing [lah] but
<malay>seram</malay> [sia] then he then they said that [oh] they will learn
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
[oh]
[oh] serious
(mmhmm)
I can I I remember but I cannot remember #ashraf#
I think infantry is like the main
<malay>kirakan</malay> body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is [ah] boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan]
[ah] I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like [oh] my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys #weh# <malay>tapi seram</malay> [seh] the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like [oh] <malay>dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [pe] [lah] aku tak kesah</malay> [ah] pick lots [jer] [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] really that's the <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] the effort
but it's <malay>seram</malay> [sia]
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically [lah] but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
!huh!
heartbreak
[oh]
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
(uh) what's the one that the Ghibli [one]
[ah] <malay>itu itu itu itu itu</malay> that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's <malay>budak kecil lagi</malay>
the part when <malay>dia apa itu dia kasi batu</malay> [eh] <malay>batu</malay> then <malay>dia ingat</malay> it's <malay>gula</malay> or something like that
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
my <malay>nenek</malay> was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
<malay>dia kata bila</malay>
<malay>dia orang tengah</malay> I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
<malay>dia nya mak bapa</malay> they put her and her siblings
<malay>kat dalam</malay>
<malay>apa itu</malay>
rice sack then <malay>letak kat dalam</malay> drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause <malay>dia orang masih kecil</malay> [kan] then <malay>dia orang letak kat dalam</malay> drain <malay>dia orang</malay> cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
<malay>lagipun masih kecil</malay> [sia] it's
damn scary
serious [ah]
#bestnya#
<malay>dia orang naik sampan</malay> serious
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying [oh] my god
when was that before the after war
#suay#
you'd be <malay>budak</malay> indonesia now !wow!
!wah! that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
[ah] okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
#hiroshima#
karma
it's the one that resulted in <malay>yang dia orangnya</malay> nuclear meltdown [kan] is it
!wah! I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how [oh] all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
<malay>cacat</malay> isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies <malay>gitu</malay> <malay>seram</malay> #siot# I wonder if they rebuilt it
the nuclear plant
!huh!
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow [ah]
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> they're very secular
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
new zealand <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> [kan] then <malay>bila kita masuk</malay> okay [lah] granted this was quite a long time ago
<malay>kita</malay> me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum <malay>dua-dua pakai tudung</malay> [kan] <malay>kita masuk</malay> cafe <malay>dia orang tengok kita macam kat</malay> zoo [sia] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when <malay>bila kita kita pergi</malay> japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares [what] you will literally like stare like nobody's business
[oh] speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian #aceh# is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one [lah]
that's true
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya [lah] it was quite #suay# that it happened and I don't think it just affected #aceh# it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then <malay>kat situ pun ada macam satu</malay> family <malay>dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat</malay> beach then <malay>dia nya anak pergi lari</malay> near the coastline ya then
!huh! serious [ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [pe]
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] like <malay>ada orang</malay> malaysia <malay>tinggal kat singapura</malay> since the borders <malay>dah tutup</malay> [kan]
then they said like
(uh) when they is the causeway open already
limited is it like <malay>orang</malay> like <malay>pekerja</malay> so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours <malay>ke</malay> [pe] he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
right it's so gross [kan] like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff <malay>dah hilang</malay> then <malay>ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau</malay> !ee! <malay>seram</malay> [sia] I cannot it's gross it's so gross
(ugh)
(ugh)
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then (uh) for all the people apparently
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan] there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of <malay>korangya</malay> government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that <malay>cuma orang dua orang</malay> [jer] are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills <malay>korang</malay> just check up <malay>sikit pun boleh</malay> [pe] the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america <malay>dia orang nak</malay> vote <malay>pun buat hal</malay>
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot [eh] my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
it's gross [sia] then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god <malay>ya allah</malay> please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump <malay>tak menang</malay> serious I if people if
people are still <malay>dia orang nak tulis apa tu</malay> cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit <malay>bodoh</malay> [ah] honestly like what's the point a lot of people <malay>dia orang tulis nama</malay> kanye west [tau] because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about [oh] vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
<malay>asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah</malay> serious why it's so <malay>bodoh</malay> I cannot and the fact that
I don't know [lah] it's just okay [lah] granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever [lah] it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
it's like I was a bit scared because <malay>jangan</malay> vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you <malay>kena tengok pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that <malay>nampak macam</malay> gangster <malay>mat mat</malay> on the street <malay>macam mat</malay> biker <malay>ke</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> at like
please [lah] if they
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] don't vote anyhow for the reform party [lah]
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
like I get that it's good to have opposition but <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] don't
I have to admit though cause <malay>dahulu</malay> I <malay>tinggal kat</malay> #serangoon# [kan] I used to stay under worker's party area <malay>yang</malay> #hougang# #serangoon# #aljunied# <malay>itu</malay> I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right [lah] ya <malay>dia orangnya</malay> financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get <malay>kalau</malay> they're <malay>dia orang dah kat dalam</malay> government
<malay>abeh itu</malay> then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
then the money shouldn't it be equal
