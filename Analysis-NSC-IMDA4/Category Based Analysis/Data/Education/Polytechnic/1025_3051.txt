okay so
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] actually I feel like
<malay>aku aku semalam tak tidur</malay>
so I feel like I want coffee
ya
<malay>aku tak tahu mana nak makan</malay> [sia] these days I feel like
I like
so hard to choose a place to eat
(mm)
okay
[orh] ya
I haven't tried [sia] everybody tried already but I haven't try okay [ah] for dins
okay
[oh] <malay>aku nak cakap dengan kau</malay> just now okay so like since last week [ah]
like
I <malay>aku</malay> everyday <malay>datang balik sekolah</malay> to like do do my work
and then at from from the start I felt like
I I did well
like okay last week I I started off like
I wouldn't say early [lah] but it was just like one week before assessment so
I started off early then at first the all all my paintings look good at first then <malay>tiba-tiba aku</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> keep telling myself that <malay>aku ada banyak masa</malay>
then end up like push push everything until <malay>macam</malay> friday which is the set up day ya then <malay>aku</malay> last minute rush <malay>abeh</malay> like
okay [lah] then I wasn't confident in myself
then my friend she she was like so invested in her
her work [lah] then
<malay>dia dia macam</malay> confident <malay>gila</malay> [lah] that then she she was proud of her work
then (uh) all this while she okay [lah] I can see her effort [ah] that she did she did put in a lot of effort <malay>tapi dia punya dia punya</malay>
(err) work is like abstract ya so not a lot of people do abstract actually
then <malay>dia berbual pasal hijab</malay>
(mm)
then I I like I genuinely thought she would get good grades [lah] <malay>tapi tadi</malay> time assessment <malay>dia kena buat rabak gila</malay> ya
because we have to leave for one day
leave it for one day ya
then (err) because (err) my work is painting paste <malay>dengan aku</malay> add four D element which is projector [lah] then (err) (mm) <malay>aku aku</malay> end up being the last because
I had to set up my mini projector then it's energy saving what so <malay>kirakan aku aku</malay> end up from register number five to <malay>aku jadi</malay> last
ya then <malay>aku</malay> nervous <malay>gila</malay> [ah] because like everybody like already presented then you know how like if you go first you cannot be compared with anybody then your if you are the last they see everyone's one even the good ones the bad ones they see everything already ya
ya then turns out they they they really like my work ya <malay>tapi</malay> like <malay>aku aku</malay> like just <malay>macam</malay> like because I felt like I didn't really do well you know
but I don't know why the lecturers like
really
ya I really didnt expect it ya ya true [ah]
[orh] cause (uh)
cause like I (uh) cause you know our vice you know sabrina
ya ya then she was there then (um)
because I was the last one right then (um) she she was not because she had to pick up a call
so <malay>dia dia</malay> leave [lah] in the middle of the
the presentation then (err) (mm) cause my artwork <malay>aku berbual pasal</malay> family then I don't know if it's because it's a very sensitive topic that's why <malay>dia orang macam tak berbual sangat pasal aku punya</malay> but then but then again right I had another classmate who like
(err) <malay>dia berbual pasal</malay> family then <malay>dia kena rabak</malay> script
<malay>lagi pun dia tak ada dia tak ada</malay> script
ya <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>berbual</malay> [kan] then she fumbled over her words ya ya
<malay>tiga</malay> because <malay>satu dapat</malay> (err) I don't know why but
(err) from the start <malay>dia cakap dia ada</malay> dengue
<malay>dia kena</malay> dengue then
ya then then he obviously had to stay home [lah] but it's been like since august <malay>sampai sekarang</malay>
ya I think he was hospitalized for like a while <malay>ni sampai ni dari</malay> august [tau]
ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] class lecturers ya <malay>satu</malay> presentation [jer]
but module <malay>sama</malay> [oh] what
okay [what] [oh] I think they did I think they wanna see another person's perspective
(mm)
[orh] true really
but my my lecturers are all adjunct lecturers though
like part time [ah] processor
ya <malay>tapi dia orang semua baik</malay> [ah] but
<malay>rabak</malay>
[ah] (mm) you mean but this one you mean last term [lah] (mm)
<malay>tapi sama</malay> sem
[eh]
no [lah]
I forgot I forgot that year one [ah] (uh)
(uh) (uh)
I forgot cause like for me fine art because
<malay>kita asyik tukar</malay> class
ya then last semester we were doing something else like we we experiment with like two D three D four D ya <malay>kau punya</malay> is <malay>kau terus masuk kau punya</malay> ya
(uh)
(uh huh) <malay>tapi shu dengan naj masih sama</malay> class [ah]
<malay>tak faham</malay>
[eh] cool <malay>ke</malay> [pe]
I I think right the packaging design was like one of my
if that one is your part of your module it was offered to me for that one [sia] ya
best <malay>ke tu</malay>
figure drawing at least <malay>macam rilek rilek</malay> [jer]
