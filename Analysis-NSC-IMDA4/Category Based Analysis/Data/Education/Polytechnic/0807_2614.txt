it's not I can choose and go right
good luck [lah]
<malay>dia dah dia dah</malay> twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty <malay>habis itu</malay> twenty <malay>dia</malay> twenty one [eh] twenty
<malay>habis</malay> poly
you say he year three right
ya next year april right
you graduate
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one <malay>dia</malay> enlist or twenty
let's say <malay>pergi</malay> twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three <malay>dia akan keluar</malay> twenty three <malay>baru keluar</malay>
<malay>itu pun kalau dia</malay> straightaway like okay after this I do this after this <malay>kalau dia macam nak</malay> stop <malay>sekejap nak kerja</malay>
because if you want to go uni with I think (uh) working experience is better
one or two years
but
no cause that [one] is right I think is <malay>kalau</malay> I don't know [ah] I think because I [oh] is masters masters then you need that [one] to two years of working experience
ya
mash mush
if I'm not wrong bachelor is
bachelor is the degree
[eh]
bachelor is before <malay>ni</malay> [kan] before degree right
(hmm) I think so I don't know I not sure maybe master degree then is degree then degree is bachelors
LASALLE or NAFA is a uni [meh]
ya I thought is
you should join before before poly my friend <malay>dah masuk</malay> NAFA now
never even go poly
[oh]
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but <malay>kena kerja</malay> one year
he singaporean also he have to <malay>kerja</malay> one year and <malay>tak pergi sekolah</malay> for one month
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] <malay>dia kata tak dapat</malay> then he work starbucks for one year <malay>baru</malay> work
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia suka</malay>
(hmm)
some more <malay>mak dia tak nak bayarkan</malay> he have to pay himself
if your parents pay for you then okay [ah] if not because he say like quite quite ex
okay
okay let's say if your is actually good would you go for do you think you want to go for poly [eh] poly uni
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh yang</malay> she study and she's good at it also it's good [lah] because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your <malay>gaji</malay> is two point five then if you enter with a degree your <malay>gaji</malay> is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know <malay>macam</malay> two point five <malay>abeh</malay> maybe after two years later your boss <malay>naikkan gaji</malay> two point seven two point eight I don't know
no [ah] it's considered but for a start it's considered a lot
but for
my for like my course is not a lot my course (uh) starting for diploma is three point two
ya that's why it's so damn hard
yes
so is <malay>kalau</malay> I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two [ah] if I go for a hospital
that's considered a lot [ah] like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay [lah] enough [what]
no five K one person
but that's not bad [what] you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay [ah]
so they add up together <malay>dah</malay> seven K seven K is enough
<malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
but like I think for comfortable life <malay>macam betul-betul</malay> comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
I think something right starting another business [sia]
(uh) no it's the same (uh) like food but then another another shop so like she <malay>buka</malay> same shop
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tahu</malay> [kan]
like I tried [lah] like my mum own cooking at home <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] <malay>takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap</malay>
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing [eh] like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help <malay>aku macam</malay> I don't like [lah] this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister <malay>itu semua untuk buka</malay> this kind of shop
ya you know <malay>yang kedai yang</malay> <malay>ni</malay> she actually wanted to
[oh] ya you actually wanted to <malay>tutup</malay> the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back <malay>pasal</malay> her her work workers <malay>macam tak bagus</malay> her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
like six [eh] seven to three [jer]
so it's not like very long hours
<malay>otak kau</malay>
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
ya it's just like that I mean <malay>dia punya pekerja</malay> like the food standard is always <malay>macam tak</malay> constant <malay>sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap</malay> that kind
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall
is four K you know
my mum pay monthly four K <malay>orang semua terkejut</malay> [sia]
<malay>dorang macam</malay> how you make money here then <malay>mak aku macam</malay> (uh) cause my mum she smart [lah] in business she smart in business she just put everything <malay>macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua</malay> [kan] then they just tell people then she just put on her <malay>barang</malay>
so she just take everything and just put <malay>macam</malay> no matter <malay>benda tu orang nak ke tak</malay> just put [lah] like <malay>kalau orang nak beli</malay>
ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K
ya then like
<malay>tapi</malay> because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum <malay>takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai ni mahal</malay> [sia]
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this [one] you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill <malay>kena bayar sendiri</malay>
<malay>bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri</malay> then aircon <malay>dalam tu macam rosak gitu</malay> so cannot feel
ya (uh) <malay>tak dia</malay> repair but you know the thing is <malay>kita tak ada</malay> aircon [ah] the aircon <malay>macam tak boleh rasa</malay> then <malay>abeh</malay> you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
<malay>pastu</malay> engine <malay>dia</malay> keep trip [ah] <malay>macam dia punya mak aku</malay> my mum say can only open like two switches at a time <malay>abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat</malay> like two switch at a time <malay>kalau nak panaskan</malay> it's like very <malay>lambat</malay> [kan]
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip [kan] <malay>tak ada lampu</malay> for like thirty minutes <malay>tak ada lampu</malay> [tau] then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
but
what the hell two switch <malay>abeh dah</malay> [lah] <malay>mahal abeh kau cakap buka</malay> two switch
<malay>merepek</malay> [kan] then <malay>mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>kedai ni</malay> then after that my mum <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] to leave the <malay>kedai</malay> [seh] like like the <malay>kedai</malay> then after that my dad already <malay>dah tukarkan</malay> the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad <malay>dah tukar</malay> we can open all the switch already then it won't trip <malay>bapa aku cakap</malay> they use the wire <malay>yang</malay> lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire

<malay>pasal dulu</malay> it never close you know
<malay>mahal kedai tu</malay> is like you know that time they asking from #sara# for twelve K a month
for that shop

yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw <malay>macam</malay> #sara# <malay>punya kedai</malay> always <malay>banyak banyak</malay> queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing <malay>macam</malay> you are trying to benefit from people <malay>punya</malay> business

cause they always <malay>keluar gi</malay> malaysia all this together
now <malay>dorang ni ke</malay>
they are at home [what]
is either at home <malay>biasanya dorang masak kat rumah</malay> then they send to the shop

that's why they
<malay>sekarang bapa dia bawa</malay> grab [pe]
should be business <malay>tak cukup</malay> or like they have a lot of things to pay [ah] <malay>pasal dulu</malay> [kan] the business very good
