ish

#tini#
no to #tini# to #tini# so
no so it's not that (um)
meeting #tini# was just like a coincidence thing cause she <malay>dia dia kerja dekat</malay> the hostel <malay>kat mana ni</malay> clarke quay then I was working <malay>kat lima</malay> [pe]
on that day
so I I know that #tini# has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like [eh] babe come [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] like
[ah] <malay>apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima</malay> like we can just like hang out [eh] no that time <malay>habis kerja siang</malay> two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like #haji# lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in #bali# when me and #azmi# left so when me and #azmi# was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> [lah] no [lah] nothing <malay>dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas</malay> that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like <malay>macam</malay> [orh] this jas guy is nice <malay>memang</malay> he he he is a very <malay>lepak</malay> guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with #tini# cause we asked #tini# face to face so all these while when #tini# like when we when me and her hung out [ah] like she like [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> #bali# this happened and then he give me all these
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
<malay>tini macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal</malay> sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking <malay>dia dia lupa</malay> [pe] [sial] <malay>kita</malay> like in a group ya correct then (um) like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just <malay>diam</malay> I just cause she she
[ah] she was just basically <malay>macam</malay> member [lah] [eh] jas <malay>gini gini gini</malay> I don't know I have [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know commitment issues #tini# like of course [lah] [kan] <malay>dia dengan dia punya</malay> commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know [ah] this happen and then she's like [oh] jas told me <malay>dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia</malay> after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah !hey! cause <malay>dia lupa</malay> [sia] correct then I
when I hear all these things from #tini# I'm like bullshit bullshit [sial] [lah] <malay>dia ni puki betul budak</malay>
so at some point no we hung out <malay>kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar sabar</malay> so
at at some point #tini# said this sentence (um) jas <malay>cakap dengan aku</malay> (um) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I never felt like this for a girl before <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told #tini#
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then #tini# just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah <malay>hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan</malay> sarah babe
pizza
so sarah
<malay>tak</malay>
no she and I and I told #tini# #tini#
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out <malay>tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual</malay> [lah] <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> then at at some point I told sarah sarah
(um) this #tini# and then sarah went ballistic already [ah] cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
cause what me and #azmi# told her was that actually jas and <malay>tini tak ada apa-apa</malay> but when we were there <malay>memang</malay> they really like
they they told me to they told to our face [eh] <malay>tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas</malay>
ya jas <malay>dengan tini</malay> and then when we left back when me and #azmi# left first then they stay in #bali# apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her [lah]
[ah] so <malay>dia masih dia dia fikir dia</malay> casanova this guy <malay>sana</malay> like that so (um)
she just went her <malay>minah</malay> [lah] she did became the <malay>minah</malay>
(err) <malay>dia salahkan</malay> jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so [ah] ya then then that night happened and
no #tini# didn't want to talk [what]
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause [oh] maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
ya then I'm like <malay>kau nak pergi berbual dengan</malay> sarah <malay>buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan</malay> jas I say like that <malay>dia yang buat</malay> problem [pe] like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to #tini# which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with (err) sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and <malay>dekat rumah dia dekat yang</malay> #percil# <malay>tu</malay> [ah] we we <malay>lepak</malay> we hung out
(um) and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to [ah] she she said that
[ah] I am what was the word she used (um) <malay>macam berbual belakang dia</malay> [ah] like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole (um)
(err) bash thing
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like <malay>aku</malay> rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask #azmi# you can ask #nisa# or whoever was there at your birthday [lah] that was your birthday right my intention was really [eh] sarah this this happened to sarah okay <malay>sekarang</malay> like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and #azmi# in confident and I go out <malay>macam</malay> to her <malay>aku</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> #lan jiao wei# <malay>pasal dia</malay> babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could [ah] tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation [ah] what I <malay>macam</malay> [ah] what I [ah] take from it is that [ah] sarah and sarah is <malay>dia</malay> always <malay>takut</malay> (err) she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel [lah] this is just my personal
(um) <malay>macam</malay> (um) how to say [eh] <malay>macam</malay> (um)
no no no like <malay>macam dia jaga</malay> conduct
like like her way her her image is <malay>dia nak kena jaga</malay> conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one [ah] [ah] I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not <malay>nangis</malay> to #azmi# but <malay>macam</malay> I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told #azmi# that I I I I know this is my <malay>niat</malay> but sometimes <malay>kadang-kadang niat baik</malay> but (um) you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
from then onwards I I <malay>macam</malay> I [ah] back off sort a little bit to really
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya ya correct cause correct #tini# told me ya sorry #tini# #tini# told me that (um) <malay>macam</malay> I've I don't open up to guys [one] like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she <malay>senyap</malay> this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
(um) like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the #laksa# thing we were having I was pissed off [lah] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you <malay>macam nak buat</malay> [sial] <malay>kat kau</malay> you know but
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still [eh] <malay>jom</malay> [ah] <malay>lepak</malay> even though for months you been [eh] come [ah] we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
#nisa# did #nisa# did
[eh] #nisa# did and then I I put also [eh] #tini# we miss you [ah] we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that [what]
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
<malay>kau cakap dengan aku pasal</malay> something I don't go to <malay>ni</malay>
I I will never do things like that
[ah] no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my <malay>macam</malay> (um) my intentions to [ah]
hurt
we and it for us like sometimes [oh] we talk about <malay>tini macam gini</malay>
but gossip is <malay>kau tahu dia ni</malay>
ya
ya right ya
so ya [lah]
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
(um) in our <malay>macam</malay> friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
[ah] <malay>hati dia</malay> like she wants to <malay>jaga</malay> her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
[eh] <malay>bilang aku bilang aku</malay> you know
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya
you know you talk about all these cliche romantic things like till till death do us part in sickness and in health and all this bullshit it's not bullshit really like it's not it just doesn't apply to a marriage or a boyfriend girlfriend and like
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to <malay>gaduh</malay> ya and any relationship will have that <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>apa</malay> (err) what what's that word [ah] friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to <malay>gaduh</malay> in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where <malay>apa aku cakap</malay> too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
even even with #nisa# sometimes you know like [ah] I'm not comfortable [ah] talking about it like good then I'm like great #nisa# thank you like no I respect that
ya
it's an asian thing also [ah]
[kan] <malay>pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cakap nak kena</malay>
<malay>dua tiga kucing berlari</malay>

this was like secondary school and (um) he gave me his phone numbers and then we talk on the phone so we've been talking on the phone
and then suddenly some girl

this group of boys <malay>tak ada</malay> judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
I I feel like my generation in the late twenties early thirties there are there's a judgemental state
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like <malay>macam</malay>
