<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] its like
the spur of the moment that kind of thing [eh]
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through [lah] !huh!

[ha] I didn't know [oh] ya yes ya recently like one of the <malay>budak yang</malay> [dah] he came back to station what last night
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of #angmohs#
then the guy like <malay>bawa motor</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
then he <malay>bawa motor</malay> then he got tattoo then the #angmoh# like [eh] !wah! you are so cool then the malay guy was just like
#siao# [lah] <malay>ini semua malik</malay> in singapore <malay>ada</malay> [sia]
<malay>bukan apa yang</malay> special
but he like just step step <malay>begini</malay> [ah] like that
but the #angmohs# were like you're you're so cool
ya [lah] he working at some burger
like the standard [lah] <malay>kadang kadang belakang</malay>
on the arm
it's a <malay>belakang tangan dia begitu ada apa tu</malay> flower something like that [ah]
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>ada</malay> colour <malay>punya ke</malay>
<malay>tapi beberapa beberapa begitu beberapa ratus</malay> [ah]
[orh] I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people [ah]
no [lah] it's just like her own <malay>macam tak ada kerja nak buat</malay> then just
brand tattoos for her friends that kind [ah]
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first [lah]
which is <malay>macam</malay> <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
<malay>macam tengat buat kerja tidur</malay> [ah]
[ha]
actually
you you know you know about the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>bekam</malay> before

like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part [lah]
so while I was getting that thing I was just thinking [ah] [sia] [lah] <malay>sakit</malay> [pe] this one confirm <malay>macam</malay>
I think like this is what tattooing feels like [ah]
and maybe if you ever think about getting tattoos again you should go for the <malay>bekam</malay> first [lah] then
you see how it feels [ah]
but like <malay>sakit gila</malay> [sia] it's like
<malay>pedih</malay> [ah]

like
six thirty <malay>kira bangun</malay> and then <malay>tengok bawa mendap</malay> then six thirty [ah]

then <malay>bangun</malay> like <malay>bangun</malay> like I don't know [lah] like ten eleven that kind then <malay>balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] no rush like not like I'm in a rush to do anything also so like okay [lah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [ah]
ya
[orh]
then <malay>keluar makan semua semua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa ramai ramai</malay> [ah]
[sia]
[oh] then my medical call
not bad [ah]
quite interesting [ah]
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill [lah] yes [ah] okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
<malay>kalau merepek ke apa</malay>
not <malay>nak merepek</malay> [lah] but it's like <malay>tak tak tak</malay> serious [ah]
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
as in we were rushing up but <malay>tak macam lari tak lari</malay> [ah] just like brisk walk that kind of thing
then we reached the lift lobby
we reached the lift lobby then suddenly one guy came running then he was like panting and <malay>berpeluh semua</malay> then he come in already
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
(err) are you the one who called just now then the guy was like [ah] ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he [oh] his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is (uh) pretty rare [ah] to to to see like shocks getting given by the [ah]
ya but the guy
<malay>beberapa</malay> shock [ah]
[dah] <malay>beberapa</malay> shock already
<malay>tapi</malay> they shock all in the ambulance [ah]
(uh huh)
[oh]
[orh] but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping [ah]
I I think so
<malay>itu kali bila dia orang jumpa dia tak tak</malay> breathing [ah] no breathing no pulse
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
[oh]
[ah] quite fast [ah] actually cause <malay>yang abang dia jumpa dia</malay>
so <malay>dia abang jumpa dia</malay> then he collapsed so I that one maybe estimate five
<malay>tak</malay> (um) I think I think five ten minutes max until the brother found him
then the <malay>abang</malay> straight away he called nine nine five then he started doing
then I think nine nine five dispatch the near the my responder app <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] ya people actually use that [ah] do you know that people actually use that
compulsory to what
[oh] serious [ah]
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah] I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay [lah] that guy quite nice the the community responder
he <malay>naik basikal</malay> then he cycled over
cause he was at home [ah] he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
so from from no breathing no pulse [ah]
[oh] ya that guy
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so it's within like ten minutes <malay>kena buat</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak buat</malay> then
confirm gone [ah] is it
<malay>macam</malay> just show show face [ah] okay
(uh huh)
got the what again
[ah] the the one and two and three and four and that kind [ah]
[ah]
wait that was a doctor [ah]
<malay>asal boleh</malay> [jer] doctor
it isn't you know
!wah! <malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
#sian# [sia]
who gets to do as in nobody want to do [oh] nobody wanna do
why [sia]
(uh)
!huh!
but (uh)
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also [lah] so he was saying that
cause
when this is a new thing also [ah] like during out time was it or <malay>tak ada</malay>
[orh]
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is [lah] but like
I don't know [lah] like a bit half useful a bit half <malay>macam</malay>
no point
cause I don't think I don't think anybody would ever get conveyed their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>siapa</malay> about conveyance
[oh]
like normal alpha <malay>tak ada buat</malay> [ah]
so can [what]
!huh!
[ah] ya ya the ugly one [lah]
[oh]
ya ya
[oh] ya I #ding# was telling us [lah]
actually they can <malay>buat</malay> [ah] <malay>habis buat</malay>
<malay>terus yang nyonya tu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> feeding tube so <malay>makanan terkeluar</malay>
<malay>habis cakap busuk gila</malay> [ah] so then he straight away ask the boy to take over
also he said <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>nak muntah tu</malay>
like <malay>busuk sangat nak muntah</malay> you take over [ah]
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the [lah] recall
[ah]
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
medical relay [ah] <malay>habis dia nampak segak entah</malay>
okay [ah]
cause I came also like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai seluar</malay> [jer] [ah] bunker <malay>dengan seluar</malay>
then the top helmet <malay>put tak pakai</malay> so it's just
<malay>bawa</malay> that one medical <malay>punya</malay> equipment bag then <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
then go up
but okay [lah] fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress [lah] cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no [lah] but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya [lah] definitely [sia]
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge [lah] but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the [ah] take charge
cause the [dah] <malay>kena buat</malay> one year course [ah] as in their attachment to the medical side
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
last time <malay>macam</malay> indefinitely [kan] <malay>dia orang kat</malay> medical side
but now makes sense [ah]
ya
and fire bike
!huh! ya <malay>ke</malay>
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
[oh]
(uh huh)
eight people
!wah!
but <malay>asal boleh sampai lapan orang buat</malay> is it wasn't like alpha be come like on time and then
[oh]
but wonder how often it's actually being used [lah] in
[ah]
[ah]
[eh] my friend from #paya lebar# also the madam told them don't turn out [sia]
they said they want to minimise
[ah] they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
[ah] fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I #suay# [ah] my
it's just my <malay>sekarang</malay> like <malay>baru</malay> like #ons# [ah] <malay>sikit</malay>
ya [sia]
don't know [ah] apparently it's the first time [ah] that
only the
they said because of the or something [ah]
but I don't know [ah] not really buying it
ya <malay>baru tukar</malay> about two months ago
okay [ah] #bo pian# [ah] just go [ah]
then they also all the all the people were like
he ask us like (uh) sec com for I left [oh] ya the worst part is that <malay>dengan</malay> is double meaning now
so like the one five <malay>tu sekarang</malay> is on repair
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
cause the crew is the exactly the same so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>sama</malay>
ya so it's called double meaning [ah]
so like
ya [lah] so must just be extra alert
okay [lah] but as in #bishan# usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
then ya [lor] that's my last duty [ah] double meaning but I left <malay>tak ada</malay> call [lah]
ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
not bad [lah] at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay [lah] interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
like <malay>betul betul</malay> I need to do on somebody I think I'd be a bit more confident now
ya
<malay>pasal macam</malay> before this you only <malay>pernah dengar macam belajar</malay> theory [kan]
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different [sia]
what didn't you download the app
[ah]
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> office <malay>cakap</malay>
I think for you all different [lah] cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay [ah]
download what
[oh] no [lah] I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
[oh] the card [ah]
[oh] for a as a reservist [ah]
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>siapa</malay> [sia]
what did I what did I teach you
[oh]
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
(uh huh)
[oh] I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected [ah]
[oh] ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know [ah]
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that one they are not choking already [ah]
!huh!
so in the end convey <malay>ke tak</malay> convey
[ha]
in case anything happen like just cover your back [ah] is it
[orh]
[oh] so she wanted to go to the hospital [ah]
!huh!
at least <malay>rabak</malay> call like you shagged out but at least you are doing
something [lah] you feel like you are contributing it ya
<malay>siapa siapa yang</malay> call
[oh]
[ha]
!huh!
<malay>asal dia sengaja</malay> swallow <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay> [sia]
so you were already were were you there on the scene already [ah] for this
this is the more all the at least this is one of the more interesting <malay>punya merepek punya</malay> call [ah]
apart from the <malay>yang</malay> the maid the <malay>kena rasuk</malay> that one
that was that was was that you
[orh] wasn't you [ah] [ah]
!wah! yesterday they were telling me like
(err) ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
after did you hear about the one the my batch as in the one that I going to already then the guy <malay>kena rasuk</malay> [one]
ya ya that one that one
then
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
(err) something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> there's this very thick
heavy door <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
that you can close
[ah] so like
then two of them [dah] <malay>terkeluar</malay> so got one guy left inside
then <malay>dia orang dua macam main main</malay> [lah] so they
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then <malay>dia orang tunggu kat luar</malay> then like [eh] <malay>asal tak perasan</malay> [sia]
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
banging on the door like <malay>tolak tolak tapi tak ada buka</malay>
and like the <malay>lampu</malay> was on everything
then he like
[sia] [lah] like <malay>tak ada buka</malay> [ah]
so then he don't know why okay this part this part is (err) a bit scary part [ah] he don't know why but he went to <malay>panjat</malay> to the downstairs the scary part
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor <malay>punya</malay> fire fighting store
then which doesn't make sense because
downstairs is confirmed locked <malay>apa</malay>
if upstairs <malay>tak buka</malay> then <malay>korang</malay> downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also
but he climbed downstairs
then he climbing down the ladder he looked down <malay>gelap</malay> [kan] then he saw like a figure in a corner like swing back and forth <malay>begitu</malay>
[ah] then he like <malay>panjat</malay> [ah]
then he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs
he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs then after that then the door opened [ah]
then door open then he like he told them [ah] what he saw
then the two people outside like [eh]
but we didn't even close the door [sia] we just like we just held it ajar
<malay>tak tak dengar</malay> [ah]
ya that's the
that's almost as scary as the <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
as my my my call
as in not my call [lah] but the one that guy <malay>kena rasuk</malay>
mine is mine is like first hand experience [lah] this one is just <malay>macham</malay>
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
okay [lah] but to me now that I'm not to me now that I'm not staying in station in anymore like <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah]
ya
K brother <malay>tapi semua ramai ramai</malay> [pe]

I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen [kan]
then I I was having headaches like every week
then I thought like okay [lah] maybe cause <malay>tak cukup tidur ke tak</malay>
<malay>salah bantal</malay> something like that
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
[oh] shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
(err)
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing
cause I was googling it's called photo

or less than two hours <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah] edit
(uh) <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan</malay> my
my russian teacher <malay>tu</malay> the skype over skype [eh]
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was (err) he was a having a conversation with his friends our (uh) what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me <malay>yang</malay>
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
I and the song was from #tokyo# square then she's like #tokyo# square so he thought that <malay>dia dari jepun ke</malay> group <malay>ni</malay> then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean [lah] it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was (uh)
(err) who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like [eh] that's not the famous song from #tokyo# square
but the song actually nice <malay>tapi dia pakai lagu</malay> #sukiyaki# <malay>punya lagu</malay> [tau] do you know #sukiyaki# right there's this
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the #tokyo# square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it [ah]
(uh) it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow <malay>kak tina</malay> to this concert by #tokyo# square
so #tokyo# square actually that
it's not a a got a #tokyo# square concert but they perform a few songs [ah]
(uh) because there are many other things that (err) at that show so #tokyo# square was one of them so I I I remember #tokyo# square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word #tokyo# slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
(uh) that is the originally is from #tokyo# square but there's some (uh) famous <malay>mat salleh</malay> singers sing that song [lah] western singers that (err) sing (err) #tokyo# square <malay>punya lagu</malay> but that is I say <malay>macam</malay> singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
to america right they don't have
a lot of talent [lah] they don't <malay>macam</malay> you know
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very very I think is #sukiyaki# [ah] from what I know
(uh) but <malay>dia punya</malay> melody has been reused and reused by other bands [lah] but that is not the most famous #tokyo# square
(uh) because like I mean <malay>nama</malay> #tokyo# square <malay>tapi dari</malay> singapore you know <malay>macam</malay>
that's the that's the unique thing [lah] that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin> I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin> I need you
because my I think <malay>kak tina</malay> did some events [ah] for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
put us somewhere then she brought me with her [lah] so I think one of that that's why she know #tokyo# square
(uh)
and that they were performing <malay>dekat mana</malay> [tau] <malay>kat depan</malay> if I am not wrong [eh] at this <malay>padang</malay> area near parkway parade
they had this show they had this
no <malay>macam</malay> this area <malay>dekat depan</malay> parkway <malay>ke sebelah kat</malay> parkway <malay>ke</malay> one of those area [lah] because parkway was you it was like a famous [lah] you can see shopping shopping mall shopping center <malay>dekat</malay> eighties nineties <malay>mana ada banyak</malay>
[ah] so you remember [lah]
(mm)

there were some songs that you like [what]
(uh)
sam willows
I think <malay>kalau mungkin mungkin yang</malay> singapore <malay>yang</malay> rock band [lah] <malay>yang dulu-dulu</malay> [ah]
[ah] the malay rock band #ramli sarip# all that there is known <malay>tapi</malay> for the english
medium [eh] english medium <malay>tak banyak</malay> that's why #tokyo# squares is one of <malay>tapi yang</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> sam willows <malay>sekarang</malay> famous there were a few [ah]
(uh)

at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting

he did so many wonderful songs I mean I cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous [what]
ya
[ah] ya the malay medium [lah] but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like #kit chan#
you know <malay>macam yang ada</malay> english the (err) english medium <malay>ada</malay> but they are not
they are not world famous [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the their world famous because they perform

astro [eh]
I don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this (err)
[ah] not really talent train [lah] it's just that they give opportunities for them because there's a market <malay>macam kira</malay> malaysia <malay>ada</malay> market you know
<malay>macam nak cakap pasal</malay> comedian <malay>ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar</malay> comedian <malay>pun</malay> comedian <malay>macam</malay> (err) #suhaimi# [eh] #suhaimi# part time you know at least <malay>dia dia</malay> part time mostly full time you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that I know
<malay>jadi macam</malay>

[ah] I I I understand <malay>macam boboi boboi punya</malay> jokes [eh] #boboi# the group the maharaja lawak</malay> [eh] [kan] they have #boboi# they have the different
[ah] what is that either let like either when they talk about <malay>loghat</malay> [eh] there's always a <malay>tema tema</malay> like like <malay>loghat</malay> like is always going to be malaysia <malay>menang</malay> because singapore <malay>tak pandai buat loghat</malay> you know
it's only people like [ah] #zizan# #zizan# [eh]
they can really do <malay>loghat</malay> know and they really are very good at imitating <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya macam</malay> they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know <malay>macam</malay> malaysia really <malay>bercakap loghat loghat</malay> is accent right <malay>kira loghat orang</malay> #kedah# <malay>orang</malay> #kelantan# and then
they are more exposure ya
<malay>kita punya loghat</malay> is <malay>loghat bahasa baku</malay>
no no but they are very professional I remember I <malay>pergi</malay> (err) the not <malay>kedung kodek</malay> what's that
the theater [lah] that the malaysia that we went to to watch the #nadrah# right
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the I remember I was watching <malay>pi mai pi mai tang tu</malay> at that time was #imuda# #imuda# that there were some people <malay>sayang</malay> they can perform on stage four to five hours I mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform !ee! <malay>apa tu</malay> they can really perform <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat masa yang berpanjangan</malay> [tau] <malay>macam ada</malay> stamina is really that <malay>atau buat orang macam orang pergi</malay> #kelantan# #kelantan# they they the people doing <malay>dikir barat</malay>
they can really do <malay>dikir barat</malay> the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs [lah]
I remember when M #nasir# was talking to a
(err) #hady# [eh] #hady mirza#
for the
(err) what's the talent show [eh]
the <malay>yang yang lama-lama</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia kata orang</malay> glamour <malay>ada</malay> what is that [ah]
that's the not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia <malay>dia</malay> perform astro <malay>punya</malay> [lah]
I think astro <malay>punya</malay> organise so ya guest judge was
(err) M #nasir# so (err) #hady mirza# because I also don't have astro but I watch on youtube [lah] I I I I watched through
[ah] <malay>tapi dia ada</malay> all the the veteran singer so #hady# was face off with this other
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose [lah]
[ah] so they have this person in the end <malay>dia menang dua-dua</malay> two of them <malay>memang</malay> [kan]
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think (err) (err) M #nasir# asked him (err) #hady# where have you been
why now you know <malay>macam</malay> like in a way <malay>kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat</malay> malaysia you know
because he was (err) wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work (err)
ya <malay>pasal dia dah</malay> then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really <malay>menyanyi</malay> is really his talent you know
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem [eh]
no but <malay>macam</malay> I remember when I was watching those chinese drama series [eh]
like zoe #tay# and that time zoe #tay# was the were the in she was really the talent like #pan ling ling#
junior [eh] #yuan ching# you <malay>tahu</malay> you <malay>kenal dia</malay> was she some
ya zoe #tay# was from your <malay>ni</malay>
#yuan ching# #yuan ching# <malay>yang dekat</malay> #jurong# [eh]
[oh]
her association
no but but you had that #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni is it #yuan ching#
#yuan ching# <malay>macam hancing</malay> the the #yuan ching# <malay>punya</malay> alumni dinner right you [eh]

<malay>siapa tu</malay>
(err) your friends <malay>apa ashik</malay> [eh] <malay>siapa</malay>
#amin# [kan] <malay>dia orang tak pergi</malay> [eh]
I told you the three of you form a table [what] with your other friends and <malay>sama kelas</malay>
no at that time [lah]
now <malay>memang susah</malay>
[ah]
pass away already [eh]
pass away [eh]
retired [lah]
<malay>cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar</malay> [jer]
how does it look like
is it <malay>badan besar rambut putih</malay> [eh]
[oh]
pointed out [ah]
as in he's still
actually I feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring I don't know for some reason why
I just
ya <malay>macam macam macam seroja</malay> was telling me she was retiring from right I feel so sad you know
or or even when peter bush was saying I felt so sad cause I was like what I felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad I don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
you know to be ya I mean be (err) get get new more books you know but <malay>macam</malay> the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just <malay>macam seroja</malay>
she's just tired you know
and (um)
I think that's the main reason why they retire
[eh] even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine [oh] for you you are millennial I'm not [sia]
you you are I'm not I'm older than you <malay>sayang</malay>
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
(uh) I am a generation X [leh]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>si si siapa</malay> was telling me these millennials [ah] because it's
it's really the you [lah] but you are not the the the the people that #seroja# and #borshak# was saying [lah]
the they were saying that this millennials [ah] lazy you know lazy [ah]
ya
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right <malay>mana tengok seroja</malay> I <malay>tengok kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
<malay>dia beli rumah tu</malay> about <malay>satu</malay> point <malay>satu satu</malay> point <malay>dua juta</malay> [tau]
no she said people the
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to (uh) buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house <malay>pun</malay> (err)
(uh) it's slow down <malay>macam orang pun tak nak beli</malay>
so
<malay>rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu</malay> I think
I think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak jual</malay>
(uh)
<malay>macam tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak jual harga tinggi</malay> [lah] she just want to sell (uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
<malay>dia punya rumah yang ini tingkat dua yang rumah ke sana tu tingkat lapan</malay>
she want to because she love (err) cycling
[ah] and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle <malay>dekat</malay>
her condo <malay>tu</malay> [kan] not near the beach right so <malay>macam</malay>
to her is an effort [lah] to go back and forth <malay>naik basikal di situ</malay> and I think a bit #ulu# [lah] because <malay>situ</malay> [kan] <malay>jauh</malay> [kan]
she like cycling but <malay>macam</malay>
I think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but <malay>macam</malay>
for me when I see her I <malay>tengok</malay> I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
<malay>macam</malay> is typical of (err) they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
<malay>macam</malay> still <malay>tinggal</malay> that <malay>rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual</malay> and still have (err) her she's start to pay ready for her house
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road I'm not sure maybe [ah]
I think I I don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
no no hers was second hers was a new <malay>lepas tu dia kata</malay> <malay>ada</malay>
(uh) it's new it's new
[ah] <malay>tapi besar</malay> because <malay>rumah dia belum habis</malay> renovate [eh] because they had to for stall the
(uh)
(uh) the no the the <malay>macam kira</malay> development <malay>dah habis semua tapi orang semua</malay> I think they <malay>nak</malay> renovate [ah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi pasal</malay> renovation <malay>kena</malay> put on hold because of the COVID
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
so I was thinking to myself [oh] not bad [eh] <malay>dia tak payah jual rumah</malay> in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to <malay>jual rumah</malay> so <malay>maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta</malay> I mean she's already <malay>nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu</malay> and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
and not having to borrow money from the bank
maybe she has the money <malay>ada duit juga</malay> [ah]
that one <malay>betul-betul ada</malay> (err) pool or view of the pool ya
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
<malay>tiga tiga</malay> bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice <malay>sayang</malay> it was like
[oh] my god sex heaven
(uh) I think I think for <malay>dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal</malay> condo she shared with a flatmates <malay>dulu dia tinggal dekat</malay> <malay>sekarang dia tinggal kat</malay> condo I think she found a new flatmate [eh] and then <malay>macam kat kat</malay> russia [kan] they don't have this quality of
condo [kan]
(uh) so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware [lah] about the development about about buying condo (uh) that #dasha# is aware so <malay>macam macam</malay> it's very sexy [lah]
it's very very nice
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because <malay>dekat itu dekat dengan</malay> russian <malay>nya</malay> embassy
and and then <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit timah# <malay>dia nak dekat dengan</malay> nature <malay>agaknya orang putih gitu</malay> [kan]
[ah] shared <malay>dengan ramai ramai ramai</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I never ask
(uh)
because I thought I I thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) but I think she like the location <malay>agaknya</malay>
<malay>dekat dengan rumah dekat dengan dekat kerja agaknya</malay>
(uh) because this <malay>mat salleh</malay> they like their nature they like
(uh) <malay>dia naik</malay> bus <malay>dia dia orang naik</malay> bus
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
because maybe the flatmate <malay>yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya</malay>
!huh!
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask [lah]
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
they're not really <malay>macam kita</malay> a bit rude about money we talk about money like <malay>macam</malay> I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think #dasha# will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about <malay>macam</malay>
especially french so I think it's something that they
<malay>macam</malay> it's not really the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> us <malay>cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual</malay>
(uh)
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
you <malay>tahu</malay> this this year I don't see her spending anything <malay>dia tak beli baju baru</malay>
rent [eh]
(uh)
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
<malay>mungkin dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia ke apa kita tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin ada</malay> boyfriend [lah]
that's why she move (uh)
<malay>kalau</malay> like that okay [eh]
make sense right
(uh) but #sami# <malay>suka</malay>
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam dia dia kata dia ada</malay> swimming pool <malay>kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna</malay> [kan] (uh) that's fixed to me condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam</malay> some of the <malay>aminah punya</malay> friends right they <malay>tinggal</malay> condo [ah]
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (err) I guess that's <malay>macam</malay> we have friends in I remember I have friends in
I mean we are just three room four room dweller but that this fence <malay>pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat</malay> they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
<malay>yang pak ali</malay> [eh] you know <malay>pak ali</malay> always get the best grades <malay>macam</malay> dean's lists [lah] #borhan# also the one the radio <malay>warna</malay> right but they were from it doesn't
<malay>macam</malay> ya people used to think that (err)
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]

even after <malay>tu dia</malay> continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so <malay>macam</malay> you know you have this
but he's very nice [lah] I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time <malay>kita</malay> because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you <malay>berbual</malay> and then <malay>dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang</malay> so most of the time we speak <malay>melayu</malay> and <malay>baba</malay> so
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him [oh] can you get for me this this this this you know like the like from the then he will get for me [lah] of course [lah] he won't pay for it [lah] but because it's my <malay>mahal</malay> right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there <malay>dia beli dia ingat</malay> I don't know how it is now terrence
I I found out that he was educated at #eton# so I was like #eton# then #dasha# was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to (err) the people in #eton# but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in in there's a boarding school
no no no <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> actually <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi dia kata dia</malay> not good enough [lah] #dasha# <malay>kata sebab tu</malay> #eton# they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually #eton# then after that the #eton# got
a professor but <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah]
or american [eh] but very fluent in russian and then because (err) project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but <malay>macam macam</malay> russian only a few know
you can count on your finger who will

but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year [ah] to brush up on her russia before she
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> be you know why they go to russia because <malay>dia punya</malay> tuition fee
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to or america (uh) it's recognise [lah]
singapore I <malay>tak tahu</malay> but (uh)
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when (err) #kacha# was telling me #kacha# the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to #sarawak# or #sabah#
so there were (err) she was speaking russian to her husband and <malay>dia</malay> she have two children two or three children they all go to #sabah# or #sarawak# then after that <malay>yang orang kat belakang dia</malay> there's this man [ah] (err) medical doctor
<malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns (err) medicine in russia

but she cannot come and work here
<malay>tak</malay> recognise #kelantan# <malay>punya</malay> medical certificate

to send her daughter to australia
<malay>mahal</malay>
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why <malay>dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka</malay> australia
[ah] because <malay>dia tak</malay> stress [lah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore
the pace of life is different [lah]

[oh]
ya
strength
their strength is languages (uh)
ya
ya
she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology <malay>siapa si</malay>
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test [leh]
ya but we we found out from my
<malay>ustazah yang</malay> teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example <malay>yang daripada</malay>
(err) university of
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
jordan and the university of
not cairo [lah] (err) #al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
(uh) it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
it's not considered a degree level <malay>macam</malay> for example you want to be a teacher right
they don't consider a degree for #al-azhar# a degree
yes that's what my <malay>ustaz</malay> told me
so <malay>macam</malay> it has to be like they recognize degree
(uh)
don't know #allahu aalam#
jordan I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
could be [ah] because <malay>mak dia mak dia tak nak</malay> but but but (uh) the <malay>ustaz kata</malay> that's the reason <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>kita dapat</malay> second upper the second upper (uh) or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya
ya that's why like people say why they go to <malay>madrasah</malay> for that's the big question everybody ask
<malay>siapa</malay>
(uh) #wani# [eh]
<malay>agaknya</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know now (err) COVID I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
unless they do online [lah] unless they do online [lah] but I don't know #al-azhar# now not that good [lah]
so that's why a lot of people recommend <malay>pergi</malay> jordan
there's <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
the system of learning [ah]
(err) I think ever since the the egyptian spring [ah] uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time [lah] we know that the story [lah]
[oh] now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
[kan] <malay>itu hari si</malay> king of jordan <malay>datang</malay>
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like <malay>tiga empat daripada</malay> eygpt and then she knows other dialect [lah] so <malay>dia kata ada kesian</malay> because she was telling me because <malay>dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz</malay>
<malay>ustaz hasan</malay> so <malay>dia bilang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia bilang dengan</malay> I [lah] some of them come from <malay>negeri yang</malay> you know they come from <malay>kampung</malay> so only know dialect [tau] <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend [ah]
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
and this lady have a condition [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> then I ask (err) your cousin [eh] how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into [eh] [a'ah] <malay>kak tini bukan senang</malay> you know like <malay>nak kena ni nak kena</malay> surgery <malay>nak kena ni</malay> can you imagine <malay>nak kena</malay> like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime <malay>tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata</malay> and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people <malay>agaknya derma</malay> I think embassy <malay>derma agaknya</malay> and then spend money on them you know (err) spend the money on translations (err) these translators
[oh] ya because the the king would (err) #hussein# not #hussein# I I I <malay>kenal bini dia</malay> (uh) he was very impressed the singapore side very <malay>cepat</malay> very efficient
but when I was telling doctor <malay>ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia</malay> showing off
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
(uh) that is the rumour [lah] that she <malay>tunjuk</malay> the <malay>jam</malay>
(uh) but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
(err) at the
(uh)
(err) visa at the jordianian embassy [ah]
ya but it's also something that has strength [lah] because her #fusha# is very good like the <malay>orang arab dengar</malay> #fusha# [lah] <malay>yang</malay> I try to <malay>berbual dengan ustazah hadijah</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> #fusha# but okay so <malay>macam</malay> the the difficult dialect is not egyptian [lah] according to them [lah] but I don't know I <malay>tengok</malay> egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt <malay>punya</malay> dialect very near #fusha# the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran [lah] you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the #fusha#
<malay>banyak orang arab banyak</malay> [kan] very diverse
that's the that's the thing [lah] so they get whatever they can
<malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> egypt <malay>itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama</malay> she even take she even take #talaqqi# courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take #talaqqi# she taught she taught me how to <malay>tajwid</malay>
she told me <malay>yang</malay> the and then when I ask #abi# #abi# say <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>ada yang ustaz yang</malay> famous <malay>sampai boleh kalau</malay> you <malay>buat salah</malay> your <malay>bacaan sampai boleh ambil</malay> you know your you know the what is that thing [ah]
when they collect the smoke the cigarette <malay>punya</malay> ashes [leh]
(uh) they can throw that at your face
like <malay>garang</malay> [ah]
you know but that is the the the nature [lah] but then you want to get the #sadat# [eh] they call it #sadat# you you want to get #sadat# so you do that [lah]
let her just stay here [lah] let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
let her <malay>bukan</malay> poly <malay>tak boleh pakai tudung pakai</malay> [jer] <malay>tudung kat</malay> poly
(uh)
or you want her to go okay [lah] go <malay>pakai</malay> then there's the other thing [lah]
I think (err) <malay>tengok</malay> appetite <malay>dia macam</malay> math and science
language is a bit hard [lah]
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
(uh)
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength [ah]
in singapore you cannot do well <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't think so [lah]
(uh) I mean I have friends who who like for example #murni# and I have a mutual friend
(err) <malay>namanya</malay>
(err) okay [lah] one of our girlfriends [lah]
so I'm not that close to her [lah] because
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] I just <malay>tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat</malay> [lah] but she's very close to #murni# so now she's the
<malay>punya</malay> translation unit she she's the head you know
I mean I don't have to worry about it until
<malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>selalu berbual dengan dia</malay>

thursday
[eh] then <malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>macam mana sekolah dia tu</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> what we hear <malay>lepas tu ada kata</malay> start january <malay>ada</malay> start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no [lah] I mean
(err) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean the the the
correspondents <malay>tu macam</malay> last time when I go melbourne study [kan]
in #seoul# is one of the agency other agency <malay>pun ada</malay> so like this (uh) uni [oh] kaplan one of it is there any other agency
we went to kaplan to register her
[oh] different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging [oh] no you cannot then you have to go this
uni <malay>mana apa buat</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
it's exam-based also [lah] I mean written written exam
but if there's no choice how <malay>rasa</malay> if
the one that those without the <malay>apa</malay> is without the examining examination <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
how many choices she have
but
so <malay>nak kena ambil</malay> I mean it's the same
line [kan] must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses [eh]
ya I mean with this combination diploma
if she opt to other <malay>macam</malay> early childhood
can she use the diploma or <malay>tak boleh pasal dia tak</malay> bridging
ya example <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] this [one] <malay>ada</malay> the next one is this [one] is (uh) no not examinable
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam [lah] [kan]
no choice
that's two [lah] <malay>satu sama ada dia nak ambil</malay> with examinable
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
and also must know whether the diploma if she has <malay>tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi</malay> [kan]
cause if she wait again <malay>dah</malay> she waste one year <malay>ni dia</malay> wait again <malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>nak buat cepat</malay>
now is december
I thought she say <malay>dia punya sekolah macam</malay>
career gardens <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
is different course now this the uni is still exist [lah] I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more <malay>kenapa</malay> low intake <malay>ke</malay>
but part time will be what how many years three years
[orh]
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
<malay>apa</malay>
her
[orh]
[ah]
but the thing <malay>kalau macam</malay> because now <malay>pun</malay> she take the bus <malay>pun</malay> she will pay adults fee just no school pass [kan]
then she's no more [ah] means she's tertiary student what
(hmm)
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this [one] is (uh) this [one] the
[ah] bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
(mm) waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that <malay>baik</malay> go to other place [seh]
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out <malay>nanti tak tahu lagi</malay>
ya
(mm)
but I mean does it change if
this is kaplan <malay>tukar dia punya</malay> uni [kan] with these courses
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
can check online <malay>tak</malay>
cause now is limited time [eh] <malay>sekarang dua puluh</malay> plus
I her <malay>other</malay> friends <malay>sekolah mana</malay> private <malay>mana</malay>
kaplan <malay>juga bukan</malay>
with her behaviour <malay>seram</malay>
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside
that's the things [lah] [kan] whether you can be safe or
don't know what's going on
your lifestyle [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>campur-campur orang</malay> okay (uh) <malay>jaga diri</malay>
because <malay>suasana lain</malay> [tau] <malay>suasana</malay> part malaysia <malay>suasana</malay> part <malay>suasana</malay> part
<malay>ada</malay> [tau] [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang si ustaz anak dia</malay> [kan] remember murdoch <malay>apa yang ustaz</malay> #salim# <malay>pun</malay> [kan] you just (uh) go over to malaysia [lah] rather than go
so that's why you have to explore okay with this diploma
what you can when (uh) other uni other places <malay>kena</malay> start <malay>dia punya tu</malay> [kan] then from there
<malay>kalau kata</malay> recognise that's a plus point [lah] [kan] I mean singapore to malaysia <malay>tu</malay> !wah! one more year

(uh) he was inside that group also and I never talk to him at all so
I type something I think I type like <malay>macam</malay>
this was like in like primary five I think ya
ya
ya okay anyway
anyway
he [oh] sorry I typed if I'm not wrong [lah] maybe something like she have [kan] <malay>salah</malay> right ya
and then he corrected me [seh]
ya he corrected me and then he's like [oh] your english sucks
ya then I <malay>macam</malay> at that point of time I was like rude
ya ya and then I left the group
ya I left the group cause
<malay>macam</malay>
because of him [lah] to be honest and that was like rude [what] like I know [lah] like my english sucks at that time of point but you don't say that to a person
I don't know I I don't care
I have no idea I literally have no idea
(ugh) that's not the point
[ah] just just so rude but anyway
that incident made me want

me too
serious
but like before the test she look she looked confident to be honest ya
(uh) like she sounded confident [lah] ya right
[eh]
ya mine also mine was smooth also <malay>macam</malay>
I think it's just the nerves [ah]
!huh! serious why
but she book already
then she should book
ya or not confirm like <malay>lambat gila</malay>
you already have motor just take the motor [lah]
okay [lah] actually no it's good

but it's okay I mean at least her instructor nice [kan]
ya and the <malay>pakcik</malay>
her own instructor
ya

it's outdoor activity <malay>macam</malay> outdoor outdoor learning ya
sort of but she but she applied for to teach
<malay>belum</malay> she just went for the english test
I don't know like after this english test then she will
but I think the english test should be final <malay>macam</malay> like the final round I guess ya then she will know [lah] ya
teaching [ah]
this is diploma in teaching
ya diploma so she can only teach in primary school if I'm not wrong
ya then <malay>kalau</malay> she <malay>nak ajar kat</malay> secondary then <malay>kena ambil</malay> degree [ah] ya
obviously but speaking of that
I suddenly <malay>macam nak</malay> apply for
at first <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> my ambition [eh] <malay>dengar</malay> my ambition like when I was younger was to teach <malay>macam</malay> like ya like I always know [oh] maybe I want to become teacher whatever
and then like and then throughout (mm) secondary school poly <malay>macam</malay> okay not so much like not so much of like I wanna be a teacher and things like that
then suddenly but now I don't know why <malay>macam</malay> I feel that maybe being a teacher is not so bad after all
ya I don't know how about you
industry
[oh]
[oh] so when what do you mean by food what manufacturing [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like what you do
like do you get
okay

okay
[oh] <malay>faham faham</malay>
chemistry
[oh]
I get it then so what could be your potential future careers with that degree
what would it be
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
<malay>macam</malay> niche [lah] right ya <malay>baik</malay> [ah]
I see but so interesting
[oh] anyway ya speaking of becoming a teacher like the whole point I feel that a career should be fulfilling right <malay>macam</malay>
I don't want to just ya like I don't want to just work for the money you know <malay>macam ambil duit abeh balik</malay> ya
ya
[oh] serious why
(uh huh)
[oh]
ya
(uh huh)
as in nursing <malay>belajar</malay> nursing
[oh] but why I thought she just got a full time job
I no no I don't understand I don't see the point
but it's just what she's suddenly passionate I mean like not passionate but interested or
but to be honest <malay>macam</malay> just take one thing at a time [ah]
ya I mean and she <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay>
<malay>abeh nak</malay>
exactly
exactly <malay>abeh nak ambil</malay> nursing
options
okay that's true
ya ya
stick to one
okay [lah] hopefully
<malay>doakan</malay>
ya
but to be honest my degree also I'm also not so sure if I want ya
if I want to
ya stay or like continue finishing
but it's tough [lah] I mean it's ya it's <malay>banyak nak kena fikir</malay>
!huh!
no as in <malay>aku tahu</malay> [ah]
not in the in that regard but <malay>macam</malay>
don't know <malay>kalau</malay> don't know if like it's the right choice or not ya
ya
so did you apply for the for the <malay>madrasah</malay> course
why
!alah! this is why
<malay>ilmu ilmu apa</malay> [eh] <malay>pengetahuan dunia dan akhirat</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya honestly
but their I mean the teaching style is quite relaxed ya
and <malay>kebanyakan macam orang</malay>
!duh! but <malay>orang muda</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> our age [ah]
it's not a <malay>syarahan</malay> it's really <malay>macam kau belajar buku</malay> like all the <malay>buku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam ada banyak banyak buku</malay>
<malay>kitab</malay> sure like okay sure ya
but interesting [lah] ya <malay>macam</malay> some like you never know that there are things that there are more things to be explored ya
<malay>macam</malay> sometimes the things that you know you think you know actually you don't know
ya so and it's interesting [ah] and the <malay>ustad</malay> funny
ya
<malay>macam</malay> he's like the <malay>abang-abang</malay> type <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>buat kelakar</malay> [ah] like every single every single lesson
ya
not we are not <malay>rapat</malay> [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
as in like it's not like we talk everyday <malay>ke apa</malay>
[ah] ya like ya we are just no but serious <malay>macam</malay> in the whatsapp group like everyone's just like nice to each other [lah] ya
then just try to help out each other in any way that we can
ya ya all through zoom
but quite sad [lah] like I want to go back
I mean even uni also is through zoom
and I don't to be honest I don't quite like it
because <malay>macam</malay> not that productive
ya
serious
[oh]
are you serious
[oh] <malay>abeh</malay>
ya I don't even attend
because okay
cause
it's recorded ya so <malay>macam</malay> what's the point
if you wanna sit in <malay>abeh</malay> some of the students <malay>tanya banyak soalan</malay> and they can take up like twenty minutes you know just asking
cause I remember I was rewatching (uh) one of the videos [kan] as it <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>tanya</malay> for like like twenty minutes non stop
ya and then I just skip that part I was like
<malay>abeh</malay> lecturer <malay>dia boleh layan</malay> and he's a he's an old man [lah] so of course [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>dia macam</malay> like
<malay>ambil hati</malay> and he would he will also <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>jawab</malay> [lah] all of <malay>apa dia punya</malay> questions
exactly she's ya
[eh]
ya so ya it's damn unproductive [lah] but then again <malay>macam</malay> if go back on campus lessons only like <malay>tiga jam</malay>
<malay>abeh pergi balik</malay>
I don't know
but I think I think physical better [ah]
ya
but <malay>malas</malay> ya and <malay>jauh jauh</malay> [seh] <malay>tempat dia</malay>
<malay>aku naik apa</malay>
but I tried going to campus before <malay>aku naik</malay> train
ya <malay>abeh kena</malay> stop [ah] <malay>dekat</malay>
(mm)
<malay>aku</malay>
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] no
[eh] (uh)
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] <malay>lupa</malay>
<malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> but that time once I went there <malay>aku</malay> stop <malay>dekat</malay> I think #bugis#
(err) <malay>tak</malay> I stop at #bugis# <malay>abeh tukar</malay>
ya !duh! <malay>takkan</malay> I stop at #bugis# [sia] <malay>abeh kena naik</malay> bus
so but to be honest my dad said that like <malay>kalau</malay> my <malay>apa</malay> my <malay>kakak dapat</malay> then my dad will <malay>belikan kereta</malay>
both of us [ah]
just change [ah] <malay>macam siapa siapa</malay> like I don't know like depends on our schedule
no [lah] for what
dorm ya
no [lah] for what <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
ya but
I know but I don't think
ya
but I don't think she wants to stay at the dorm I think for us to be honest not worth it and if we have a car for what you want to stay at the dorm ya
ya <malay>fikir</malay> [ah]
ya so it makes sense [what] right ya
<malay>abeh kau</malay>
<malay>macam mana kau pergi sekolah</malay>
[oh] [oh] ya
but <malay>jauh naik</malay> public bus
where's your school [eh] like which like because I know

I mean okay [lah] like there's no COVID cases but don't take the risk [ah] ya
ya
(mm)
ya no but there was like social distancing in the cabin <malay>macam</malay> they separate with those things
ya and then they remove like I think <malay>belum lagi</malay> phase two then they remove
<malay>macam</malay> just because like [oh] decrease <malay>ye ye o</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh tak ye ye o</malay> [seh]
ya
(mm)
(mm) <malay>kat mana</malay>

ya safety one (um) I mean religion of course plays an important part I mean if I were to go to thailand
I mean it'd be difficult right language also I mean indonesia and malaysia are fine but
we have better like infrastructure and everything ya

(um) I watch this video this girl she lives in the woods
alone

ya and then she go and upload on youtube that she's living alone in the woods
right <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah]
I think <malay>dia macam</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> experience not for youtube I think <malay>dia memang</malay> you know sometimes you have those kind of people that just wanna live off the grid
right ya ya so she's one of them then she posted on youtube okay fine I know she didn't post like the exact location but I'm sure that people would like [eh] this place looks sort of and she's living alone
ya I'm like <malay>macam</malay> don't post [lah] if you're living alone quite dangerous [what]
you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> any people can like if they know where exactly you're living like ya so scary
but <malay>berani</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tinggal kat kat hutan</malay>

ya
but
ya
wait but listen
as in like ya I don't adapt well to changes and I know that and I acknowledge that

your head [lah] I think I'll cry
not in that sense
you
like do you like changes
like okay not like but comfortable with changes
[kan]
ya I mean like sometimes situation forces you [what] right
ya
but I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya
but [oh] [oh] ya to answer your question western or asian country if I if you
if I had to pick to retire I think like
western but <malay>macam</malay> I don't know
ya like would it be europe or like or like

[ha] [ha] does you feel like not being in ad hoc this year that's great
I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
[oh] because they're not gonna do any physical okay
[ah] I see (err) no [eh] they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no [lah] I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
(mm) ya ya ya
[oh]
[oh] okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
(mm) do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
(um) like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
and then yes <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>sangat</malay> [ah] try <malay>dua-dua sekali</malay> [lah]
why not and so <malay>entah macam dah</malay> try <malay>dua dua dah cukup</malay> [ah]
<malay>dah dan rasa</malay> okay [lah] <malay>dah dah puas</malay> then I I
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like [oh] like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester [lah]
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
(um) <malay>cari jodoh cari jodoh</malay> who is next
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I was like please please <malay>kakak</malay> you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
I feel she was like ya
no no no no no no <malay>sabar sabar</malay> no no okay so the the (um)
I downloaded for her Muzmatch [kan] can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her [tau] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gambar nama</malay> [jer] like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that (um)
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys [tau] so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like [oh] my god there was a okay [lah]
<malay>tak boleh tak perlu tak perlu</malay>
you can just
(err) upload <malay>lepas</malay> like <malay>bila-bila masa</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak payah terus</malay> upload
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
yes ya you try you can just try now after that <malay>lepas tu</malay> like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone [lor] then <malay>macam</malay> the account is still there there's something about you [what]
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say you <malay>nak nampak</malay> more <malay>calon</malay> [kan]
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
he was cute he was cute <malay>tapi</malay> [kan]
<malay>orang-orang kat sana</malay> [kan] is really looking for
come here looking for like [eh] it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of (um) Muzmatch and also like like half our #deen# right the app this dating apps but the half of our #deen# is
in <malay>dia punya</malay> database include international people
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
<malay>macam</malay> like
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our #deen#
I think half of my #deen# or half of our #deen# I can't remember and then (um)
she met this guy so like (err) he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
yes what what is that yes <malay>tapi kena bayar</malay>
the I think because
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch <malay>tak payah</malay>
half of our #deen# need you can have like yearly subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister (um) by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
(mm)
is it
I didn't know
[oh] okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was [oh] like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
<malay>macam</malay>
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
(um) not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
like I'm not the kind who superficially <malay>macam</malay> [oh] if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
(um) this interface to tell me okay ya
(mm)
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say [lah] like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
[eh] do it [leh] let me be the why
no [lah] I mean sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> K when I say <malay>dia orang</malay> serious [kan] it's like <malay>dia orang betul-betul</malay> serious want to put themselves out there
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that (uh)
(um) quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
[eh]
ya
ya like it really just depends on your <malay>rezeki</malay> I guess
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
I guess (um)
when you this is very superficial [lah] but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join (um) ad hoc and stuff like people already
say [lah] you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
what's like your ideal date
ya [lah]
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya but like first date you <malay>terus</malay> want to <malay>pergi</malay> trekking
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
[ah] because
<malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>duduk</malay> side by side
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
<malay>jangan</malay> date <malay>orang gatal</malay>
okay ya I agree with you <malay>pasal</malay> the movie like
<malay>kalau tengok</malay> movie <malay>tak boleh berbual</malay> and then you
<malay>buang masa</malay> like if it's a date like like first date you know that you <malay>buang masa</malay> like <malay>dua jam tak berbual</malay> then like
[oh]
I mean it opens up doors to topics of conversation afterwards like
if you going out to <malay>makan</malay> and everything
ya
[ha] your date how long
(um) okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
(uh) no I feel like trekking <malay>nanti</malay> (um)
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya [oh] let's go trekking then we see how [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> very superficial ya first ideal date [ah] I feel like
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
<malay>lalu</malay>
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
and then like <malay>dia orang masak sendiri</malay> you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like [oh] ya it's so cute
ya so sweet
the mat <malay>tikar</malay> flat lay yes yes yes yes
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
[oh] no [oh] my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
ya so <malay>macam</malay> if you think like those <malay>cerita</malay> like or like I don't know like <malay>macam</malay>
they just went toilet and then they never come back
but what if like the guy <malay>betul-betul macam</malay> very disgusting very rude
(mm)
[ah]
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is [lah]
[ah] I see
ghost
(um) so I I suddenly remember <malay>pasal</malay> you did you watch the smart local ya
ya so that was this (um) they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
by (um) catfish K catfish <malay>tu bukan</malay> <malay>kucing ikan</malay> okay <malay>tapi</malay> so basically like
(um) on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so [lah] ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like (um) he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
(mmhmm)
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
ya do you watch like the netflix <malay>punya</malay> [ha] what's the
[ah] I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing (um) that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
and then they will have like conversations <malay>bukan bukan</malay> it's not a <malay>cerita</malay> it's like dating reality
show (uh) that day I just find it
<malay>sekejap</malay> [eh]
ya and then (err) so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I I really forgot what's the show [ah] cry
maybe just finding
[kan]
just you know
I mean at this [oh] love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
(err) ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
many couples right only two got married <malay>tak salah</malay> I
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
(um) they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality [lah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
match making [ah]
(um) yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that [one] is it's kind of sad [lah] cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like [ah] you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates <malay>dia orang dah beli</malay> you know
my batch mates [tau] I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya [kan] is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
(err) ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes #hazimah#
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
[oh] my
actually ya that's a good thing [ah] and I I've thought about this my answer is no [lah] I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on story
so it was about this article about this (um) malay muslim lady who decided to make <malay>halal</malay> mooncakes because
there are a lot of <malay>halal</malay> mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
(um) to my sec four students (uh) here like (um) no actually is like [oh] (uh)
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
[oh] I'm proud to live in singapore (err) to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like [oh] K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
[oh] god
I saw I saw yes
about like [oh] like why did you not care about politics [oh] because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
(um) have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
(uh) like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me [lah] because then do I even matter to you
because I feel like if you want to be
(um) you (uh)
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
<malay>dia orang tak sedar diri</malay> [oh] my god
then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>kalau kita bilang dia orang</malay> [kan] [oh]
<malay>korang ada</malay> chinese privilege or whatever [kan] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>kecil hati</malay> [oh] <malay>mana ada mana ada korang korang ni</malay> just oversensitive [lah]
ya
I <malay>pernah ada kawan ni</malay>
<malay>dia tak percaya</malay> chinese privilege exists in singapore
<malay>dia mati-mati tak percaya</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> because is is okay
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
(uh) huge like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
so <malay>dia betul-betul tak percaya</malay> [tau] chinese privilege exists
<malay>habis dia dia buat</malay> this long twitter thread <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
it doesn't exist <malay>pasal</malay> [oh] (um)
<malay>budak-budak melayu tak bayar</malay> school fees <malay>untuk sekolah</malay> it's very very cheap compared to <malay>budak-budak lain</malay>
and then like talking about Mendaki system (uh) subsidies and stuff and like
<malay>dia betul-betul usaha</malay> [tau] <malay>untuk</malay>
prove that no chinese privilege ya
it's (uh) (uh) [oh] my god when I read it I was like K [lah] <malay>buang masa</malay> [jer] [lah] I <malay>baca tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's okay thank you very much
ya it's just (um)
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that [oh] you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
so <malay>kesimpulannya</malay>
<malay>saya tak nak anak-anak saya</malay>
<malay>awak</malay> [a'ah] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tak kisah pasal</malay> (um)
<malay>rakyat-rakyatnya yang</malay>
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
<malay>bersyukur</malay>
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
[oh] because [oh] like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like #hijabi# don't get to wear a #hijab# all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya

<malay>sedap sedap suara</malay>
!aduh!
<malay>sejuk</malay> [eh] <malay>dua minggu lepas</malay>
(err) I <malay>pergi</malay> river safari with my family
boring to be honest (uh) is like the word like it it was kind of dumb cause <malay>kita orang kena bayar</malay>
<malay>untuk masuk</malay> the boar rides five dollars
ya additional five dollars for the boat rides then I was like [pe] and then
not actually a lot of things is not on the river a lot of things is
no idea maybe there's a river there that's all
right and then I feels like [ha] maybe cause like can go first
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then <malay>kita orang pergi naik</malay> it just like a short it's like <malay>macam</malay>
a bit like a roller coaster kind of
really inside the lock right it's like a lock right there's a mechanic you know so you just go through it's like a ten minutes ride
ya <malay>kita kena bayar</malay> five dollars but besides that everything is like
no I thought it was going to be real but it's not
but but (uh) #kai kai# or #jia jia# whichever is the female [one] she's pregnant yes cute
then like they like she had to she couldn't come out [lah] she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think #kai kai# is the guy [one] #kai kai# was (um)
#kai kai# <malay>masih makan jumpa makan makan makan</malay>
<malay>habis dia makan</malay> ya
[ah] menopause ya
so <malay>dia pun</malay> pregnant [lah]
[oh] ya <malay>dia makan banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi yang</malay> the pregnant
the #jia jia# was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
ya so then the <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
(err) #kai# #jia# #kai kai# #kai kai# <malay>dia asyik makan</malay> [tau] <malay>dia habis makan satu</malay> bamboo stick <malay>panjang</malay> [kan]
<malay>selepas tu dia dia</malay> crawl <malay>dia ambil lagi lepas tu dia patahkan dia makan lagi</malay>
the whole time <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>makan</malay> [tau] I was there for a good ten to fifteen minutes I just watch
eating and eating my god <malay>dia orang</malay> cute gila
I love pandas they are so clumsy just
yes
yes
does it include animals
babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
(mm) that is interesting I think mine is also on
(uh) <malay>apa tu apa tu kucing</malay> and also you know those <malay>macam</malay> couple couple <malay>buat</malay> video
no it's not it's because <malay>kita orang asyik tengok</malay> some videos <malay>pasal</malay> couple couple so the algorithm just
shows that
<malay>macam sedih</malay> [kan]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
ya but like I feel sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> post <malay>benda yang</malay>
should have just kept it to themselves <malay>macam</malay> something not everything other people should be
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying (um)
like something are just so intimate <malay>macam</malay> I recently saw this video <malay>pasal</malay>
[oh] (um) <malay>dia</malay> went through
miscarriage and then <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>teman lelaki tengah nangis</malay> on the bed <malay>dan macam dia tengah</malay> comfort <malay>teman lelaki dia</malay> I think
a bit <malay>dia ambil</malay> video on this stuff <malay>dia macam saja nak</malay> post [jer] then I am just like this kind of things in life are
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
(uh) I like when I watch videos <malay>macam dia orang</malay>
<malay>tunjuk dia orang pergi</malay> on dates <malay>tunjuk orang buat begini begitu</malay> cute cute
they are like
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> challenge
<malay>dia orang buat apa</malay>
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like [oh]
my heart you just called me your husband
[oh] so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try [lah] like [oh] like do a live [oh] my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother [oh] okay [lah] then your friends then
husband <malay>bila dah nikah bila</malay> [ha]
#adam# <malay>apa siapa tu</malay> (uh huh)
<malay>pelamin dia kat rumah</malay> [eh]
<malay>nak tahu</malay> [ah]
I've never thought of it that way
<malay>bodoh</malay> [lah]
emcee <malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>mari</malay> (um) <malay>teman-teman dan keluarga</malay>
(um) <malay>semua orang sila carikan pengantin pengantin perempuan hilang</malay>
[oh] my god that time my sister <malay>pergi kawan dia punya kakak</malay>
(um) <malay>majlis perkahwinan</malay> then it was <malay>cantik gila dia tepi laut</malay> and
it's it's not open <malay>dia bukan takde</malay> shelter it's sheltered <malay>cuma tapi dia macam</malay> how to say (uh) it's like <malay>kampung</malay> style open windows so there is a shelter but it's <malay>tepi laut</malay>
like it by the beach <malay>tepi laut</malay> kind <malay>cantik gila</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> deco and like the view
true true <malay>kalau nanti hujan masuk</malay> confirm <malay>mahal</malay> it's definitely <malay>mahal</malay> it's a it's a well-known expensive wedding venue no no K see I have
this rule is that <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak kahwin</malay> actually <malay>takde majlis pun</malay> okay actually ya
like <malay>secara jujurnya majlis bukan untuk kita majlis untuk ibu bapa</malay> ya ya like because
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
[kan] and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling [lah] that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya <malay>orang kecil hati</malay> [kan]
ya so
#inshallah#
putting it out there yes I think my my family won't be nice too
okay [lah] good luck to my sister then
<malay>terima kasih kerana menghadiri</malay> (um) <malay>bersama</malay>
#alisha# <malay>dan sekian terima kasih</malay>

[oh] my god ya okay so I ended up buying the gold [one] apparently on Apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so I don't know whether people are blind or something
I like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby
<malay>tu perangai lembu</malay>

<malay>perangai</malay> what
okay <malay>perangai babi</malay> then
[orh]
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I <malay>mata potek</malay> or like <malay>orang</malay> Apple <malay>mata potek</malay> I do not know like I genuinely don't know
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
(err)
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
so now officially girl girl is broke I [dah] <malay>tak ada duit</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> #makan# <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> you know I was like thinking of buying like
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like (um)
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke <malay>apa</malay> #lan jiao# <malay>kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa</malay>
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
(um)
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so (um)
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story [ah] like since
(um) primary six
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] my mum <malay>pakai tudung</malay>
so like <malay>dia pakai tudung</malay> then <malay>kalau dia nak potong rambut</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kena pergi</malay> to somebody's house you know to <malay>tutup aurat</malay> and all that [lah]
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit [lah] but like <malay>raya</malay> have to go to their house cause it's like some <malay>nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya</malay> some shit [lah]
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to <malay>pakai tudung</malay> in primary school my mom brought me there [lah] instead of like the normal <malay>kedai</malay> barber and all that
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
since fucking primary six <malay>sampai</malay> last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to <malay>jadi dia punya</malay>
daughter-in-law <malay>dalam bahasa melayu apa</malay>
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously <malay>menantu</malay> material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her <malay>menantu</malay> for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her <malay>menantu</malay> you know <malay>dulu</malay> right when I was like like twelve <malay>nanti benda dia</malay> #macam# <malay>kecil</malay> [jer] [ah] #macam# she will be like
[orh] like what do you think of my <malay>anak</malay> like that like <malay>nanti aku duduk</malay> like <malay>dia kasi aku</malay> #makan# <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that [ah] give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
!hais! neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name [ah]
so his name is #Adi#</P2>
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is #Adi#</P2> something
ya I think
like it's a long name [ah] but let's just use a generic one [ah] then after that
so
(um) she like ask me like what do you think of #Adi#</P2> then I'll be like like <malay>apa kau merepek</malay> like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur #sotong# and all that all [lah] I don't know what I will do [lah] I cannot really remember
then after that like I don't know about you [ah] but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and <malay>salam dia punya mak</malay> [lah] cause like I don't know why
then I have to <malay>salam</malay> the mum then
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk [lah]
then I will just never talk to the aunt even [eh] the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
I <malay>salam dia nya</malay> mum and then straightaway <malay>dia punya</malay> mum was like
(err) <malay>kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua</malay>
then I was just like
!huh!
!huh! <malay>sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila</malay> I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
(err) I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
<malay>kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau</malay> and I was just confused you know I was just like
number one
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I <malay>sayang</malay> you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down <malay>ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri</malay> and then like he's never there
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year <malay>raya</malay> and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading [ah]
how I cut my hair
[ah] the last time I went to an actual barber
like I <malay>tudung</malay> and all that
ya so after I told !huh!
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son <malay>kau nak jadi aku nya</malay>
(um)
<malay>menantu ke tak</malay> that that happened last year [lah] but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the <malay>menantu</malay> that's all
I don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed
like I don't know it seems like
yeah I even
ya [lah] it's not considered harassed [lah] that's true
but like
[kan] I don't know it's just like a <malay>melayu nya</malay> thing
like <malay>makcik makcik</malay> be really all up in your face be like <malay>kau nak jadi aku punya</malay> (err) <malay>menantu ke tak</malay>
like how do they actually
judge you
per say you know
like
for my
my situation like I actually
they don't even know anything about me other than which school I go to I don't think she even knows what's my favourite colour
and what is she judging me as like on judging me on
when she wants me to be her
<malay>menantu</malay> like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good <malay>menantu</malay> quality like
you know it's just weird that's just what I was thinking about [lah]
that's all there's that
especially if <malay>makcik</malay> got a son that is like freaky
like you know older than you or the same age or older gone girl girl bolt outta there and run
get out
<malay>makcik</malay> I am permanently staying here you like me right can I get married now

[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
#Serangoon# [a'ah]
okay
you're already late
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to <malay>berak</malay> then you don't want to <malay>berak</malay> first and then it's just like
confused
<malay>apa yang dia nak ni</malay>
!ee! [oh] my god dude
I don't know <malay>nak cakap</malay> childish <malay>ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham</malay> [sia]
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to <malay>berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>cari</malay> toilet <malay>yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya</malay> girlfriend <malay>cari</malay> [kan] toilet <malay>buat apa</malay> #siak#
[oh] my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
(err) one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really (um) I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
kay wait <malay>kau nya</malay> boyfriend <malay>jumpa mak kau sebab</malay> #macam# <malay>kena</malay> caught is it like like <malay>terserempak kat</malay> somewhere then she's like no
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
<malay>lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang</malay> suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
!huh!
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
#lan jiao# I've been together with a guy for one year my mother <malay>tak tahu</malay> [sia]
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
actually I also <malay>tak faham</malay> [lah]
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I <malay>tak nak main main</malay> okay and then suddenly I <malay>tak nak main main</malay> equals to you <malay>kena jumpa mak</malay> I
so like I <malay>tak faham</malay> girl girl <malay>tak</malay> believe it
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
I just <malay>tak faham</malay> I was just like
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
was the one who told my friend like [eh] I want to meet your <malay>mak</malay>
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
I just <malay>tak tahu</malay>
like just touch wood [lah] imagine if you don't
like he's not the one that you marry and then <malay>korang</malay> like !wah! full blown invested like I don't know [ah] I I was just confused I never would
have gotten together in the first place [ah] of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also #Saif#</P2> so
Rudy #Aip# what's up
okay cool
!huh!
what
what
!huh!
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend <malay>lepas tu buka</malay> bank account
<malay>sebab nak kahwin</malay> like they actually like
<malay>kumpul duit</malay>
<malay>nak kahwin</malay>
are they still together
to get out of jail
[ah]
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
[oh] ya [sia] like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
<malay>dulu</malay> I would do it <malay>dulu</malay> I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
in but I would like
want him to tell me like !hey! we're gonna be in this for the long run [lah]
so okay so
(um)
there's this one friend of mine
like
(um) her name is Amy</P2>
then like
[ah]
[ah] yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day [eh] this year and like we are gonna plan for it [lah] like they actually have a plan like a future Amy</P2> has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like Amy</P2> and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
(um) she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
[oh] I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
<malay>sebab dia nak kurus</malay>
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
and you know <malay>dapat</malay>
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things [ah]
no I just got blocked nose
I don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose I don't even know why
but yeah there's that
I just like
[ah]
ya so the next time Russell</P2> asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if #Saif#</P2> texts me I'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
!huh!
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya that's why how to go drinking I ask #Russell#</P2> pay [ah] #Russell</P2> my daddy
he my zaddy
[ah]

[oh] yeah talking about your <malay>madrasah</malay>
I never
at the start I went to a <malay>masjid madrasah</malay> for awhile only like
before Andalus I started in primary one so I think when I was like in kindergarten like for two years I was at
<malay>masjid</malay> #Ahmad Ibrahim#
have you heard I think you've heard about it before no
yeah
so
(um)
the <malay>baju</malay> is green colour and then my <malay>tudung</malay> is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya <malay>telur</malay> came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow <malay>tudung</malay> really not cute
but okay so the only thing I don't even remember going there you know but the only thing that I remember [oh] my god I love my whole story is that right
I came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
the <malay>sekolah</malay> is in the middle of like a <malay>hutan</malay>
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
(um)
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like <malay>siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku</malay> you know it's like maybe I don't know
but like they went right
my <malay>yayi</malay> and my mum <malay>pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> to the <malay>masjid</malay> and then after that they actually like found out the the guy that kiss me
was like a family friend
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know <malay>sekarang</malay> I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
then like
I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
they will just say you know <malay>lelaki yang cium</malay> #Syafiqah#</P2> <malay>kat madrasah</malay>
[ah] then I was just like
you know <malay>dia</malay> literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my <malay>nyai</malay> will like talk about it to my mum
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
I cannot remember but the only thing I can remember is what my mum is telling me which I did
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama [ah] <malay>ada orang cium</malay> #Iqah#</P2> <malay>kat pipi</malay> and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my <malay>nyai</malay> to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a #ulu# place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my <malay>nyai</malay>
and then I was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so I don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
I hate myself so much I was such a hoe
at such a young age
I cannot believe it <malay>ni perangai</malay>
<malay>bakal nak jadi</malay> <malay>menantu orang</malay> you know this is the <malay>perangai</malay> that it <malay>perangai</malay>

so like ya in conclusion you really attract toxic girls
or friends I guess
okay that's a bad thing to say [lah] how are you supposed to make friends if you don't want to tell people
about
the things that bother you
but then really though like genuinely you really attract
really bad people but then we are friends so I don't know what am I saying about myself

I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!

K [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
[oh] okay [eh] <malay>tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk</malay> [ah] I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right <malay>macam</malay> hot chocolate or like
I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in [lah] like I need my dose of man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay>
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester
we were so noob man
okay can you jog my memory again york <malay>mana satu</malay>
[oh] and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain [kan] yes yes yes
[eh] it's a once in a lifetime chance [seh] we never know if we are going to pass by that place again [lor]
okay [lah] just want to check it out while we are there <malay>betul aqilah</malay>
so right what [eh] did we go to any theme parks [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay> like I can't remember like during our trip
trying to recall [lah]
(err)
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
ya only only that one (err) that one place <malay>ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia</malay>
enchanted garden or something
<malay>yang ada</malay> the one with the that float what do you call it [ah]
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what is it called [ah]
no no no it's not luge
ya but basically there was that fun huge float <malay>kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu</malay> we just slide down the slope ya get it is it

<malay>berapa</malay> [ah] <malay>berapa</malay> [seh]

ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then (um)
ya I just remember that that thingy [ah] what is it called [ah]
not not rafting [ah] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
[oh] then <malay>kita ada masuk tu</malay> haunted house haunted house
[kan] <malay>ada macam tempat</malay> I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip <malay>dekat sana</malay> then <malay>ada</malay> this little like haunted house <malay>yang kita masuk</malay>
<malay>kat atas</malay> [ah] like this house of mirrors or something like that
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to [lah] [eh] but the beaches there were nice [eh]
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
(err) no [ah] bondi [ah] bondi <malay>kat</malay> australia
ya at did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
(mm) we really miss the nature [ah]
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya [eh] but malaysia nature not bad [leh] actually
ya
(mm)
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall [ah]
no [lah] you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall we went on a major like waterfall tracking thing in tasmania [what]
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya it can layer on <malay>lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>kat dalam</malay> forests <malay>kena</malay> layer on [seh]
ya but okay [lah] I mean like okay #langkawi# has nice beaches

unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can [ah] while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have (uh) know two thousand maybe
<malay>bila</malay> [seh] how come I don't know
<malay>ni</malay> time uni [eh]
wait what did you go to spain for
[oh]
[eh] but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
but (err) <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean <malay>macam</malay> you've got to plan around your budget and everything [kan]
<malay>jauh gila</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>sabar</malay> belgium is germany right
[oh] okay okay and then <malay>apa jadi</malay>
and then
so wait the cab fare was <malay>mahal gila</malay> or what
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare [ah]
#ish# <malay>rabak</malay> or what
!huh!
so basically you were trying to catch your train (err) trying to catch your flight you mean
[eh] wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ke kau orang macam</malay> were I don't know just winging it
serious
[oh] my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
(mm)
okay okay and like the timing wise
<malay>ada</malay> buffer [lah]
this was towards the end of your trip or <malay>macam mana</malay>
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys [dah] <malay>takde duit apa</malay> [seh]
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean
okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh] <malay>faham faham</malay> K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your <malay>alasan</malay>
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[ah] so like he <malay>kena</malay> switched on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter [ah]
[oh] I see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
okay okay no [lah] because I'm just wondering <malay>macam</malay> you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
confirm <malay>tengah</malay> panic [eh] <malay>pasal macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat</malay> then you have to find your gate and everything like [oh] my goodness
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
<malay>macam macam</malay> what what would (err) the like significant moments of the trip
<malay>ada raih tak kat sana</malay>
[oh] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] spain <malay>menang</malay>
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like <malay>habis</malay>
people will probably be like <malay>maki-maki semua</malay>
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm [ah] <malay>kena jalan balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>jalan balik lepas tu</malay>
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
serious [eh] <malay>roti</malay> and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
<malay>prata</malay> [eh]
<malay>prata</malay> is everywhere
okay
wait wait wait <malay>sabar sabar kau orang dah</malay> check <malay>harga benda tu ke belum</malay>
okay okay <malay>habis</malay>
alright alright alright so you guys were like <malay>itik dengan ayam</malay> [ah] <malay>berbual</malay>
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# <malay>bom</malay> [ah] so <malay>kirakan dia ada macam</malay>
but as in they served it on the side or <malay>memang</malay> it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]

<malay>tapi</malay> like (um)
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> #macam# like
a lot of like
(um) mix [ah] <malay>apa</malay> mixed racial marriages <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] then <malay>anak anak dorang semua</malay> mixed like <malay>muka campur gitu</malay> [ah] then
like on their especially in singapore like on their it will state
what race they are what
ya [lah] then it will never never end what <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>lapan bangsa</malay> from where
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
like you are only from your mum and dad [pe] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] like you want to <malay>kira</malay> your <malay>nenek moyang semua</malay>
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
[oh] okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
<malay>tak ada kau kata</malay> like it's not (um)
(err)
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's <malay>punya</malay> race [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time <malay>kau kata</malay> like they shouldn't choose so
<malay>apa yang</malay>
like what's your point
(uh huh)
(mm)
like you say they shouldn't choose
[oh]
do you know that got some #macam#
[ah]
like <malay>kalau</malay>
okay <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian [kan] like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the race racial <malay>apa tu</malay> the quota that one right
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
(um) probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
cause like <malay>kalau</malay> this one
<malay>dorang</malay> [dah] <malay>ramai gila cina</malay>
then they need indian [pe] and then that their open slot is only indian like #macam# that open open #macam# the empty house is only open to indians
so <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian then <malay>kau</malay> identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for [ah] indian
ya
[ah]
[a'ah] I I don't know if like we can <malay>jual</malay> like <malay>jual</malay> to <malay>melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>jual</malay> to india or not
then I know like you have to <malay>jual</malay> to like
probably the same race
[a'ah] [a'ah]
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to #macam# some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying [ah] so it's like
(um)
(uh) it's like a social social inequality cause <malay>kita</malay> minorities <malay>selalu</malay>
okay [ah] I don't want to say <malay>selalu</malay> cause it's too like absolute but
(uh)
(uh) <malay>banyak kali</malay>
(um)
!chey! <malay>dipinggir</malay> yes ya yes ya
ya <malay>dipinggir</malay> is like [ah] #macam# <malay>jadi</malay> outlier <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
ya
(um) honestly <malay>aku rasa</malay>
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like (um) there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of [ah] like #macam#
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> #macam#
cause <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> quota <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation [ah] cause like #macam#
[ah] yes [ah] #macam#
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] woodlands confirm <malay>kampung melayu</malay> [sia] woodlands #yishun#

like those big houses [kan] it's like that's the
(um) expats [ah] #macam# those <malay>orang putih</malay> then they tend to live in like bigger houses [pe] so there's the #macam# they are quite detached from our society

(err) finish my practicum !yay! (um) I think <malay>semalam</malay>
technically
I complete four hundred hours [lah] around wednesday but I stretch over
cause I <malay>macam</malay> like you know
I took half day half day
[ah]
ya !alamak!
(mm) two and a half months around there
ya ya I just need to complete four hundred hours
true true then <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
#kobe#
I don't know
(uh) it's not project (um) it's just basically more case management
(uh) so <malay>macam</malay>
in a way <malay>macam</malay> same thing as (um)
what I did [lah] for my previous job
(uh) so <malay>macam</malay> meet client then (um) got assessment then <malay>lepas itu</malay>
we do [lah] same around the same [lah] it's more intense cause
(err) it's residential areas so it residential not institution [lah]
then <malay>macam apa itu</malay> my office is literally <malay>macam</malay> just beside the units where they live so <malay>macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa</malay> then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven [lah]
[ah]
I don't know if I want to say
okay [lah]
I don't know
ya [lah] okay [lah] existing cases <malay>tapi macam apa itu</malay>
because <malay>sekarang macam buat</malay> split teams [kan] then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle <malay>macam cuma</malay> two units each [lah] so <malay>kita punya</malay> outside unfortunately <malay>macam banyak</malay>
(err) like we face shortage of manpower [lah] <malay>macam</malay> cause (um) this the (err)
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs [lah] <malay>macam</malay> two services so <malay>dia kesian gila</malay> [lah] like she has to run back and like she has to toggle between both
and at that time <malay>bila</malay> phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
the (um) from the office my my office there [lah] so
so (uh) so then <malay>macam</malay> then she also has to handle the clients [kan] the office the the program that I am in and then the other program she (err) she also has to attend to the matters there [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> double work
[ah] so she <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
then <malay>baru sahaja</malay> recently another staff left ya cause
it's not <malay>pasal itu</malay> [lah] like I think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be [lah]
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay [lah]
but ya
but I don't know [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay>
(err) yesterday I meet up with the (um) [lah] then <malay>dia tanya</malay> I like <malay>kalau</malay> do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added [lah] if I want to come to the company and work then <malay>macam</malay> I don't know what program [lah] <malay>ada satu program ini</malay> dia !hey! just started up their office is in #simei# which is like great [lah] <malay>macam</malay> very near my house
finally somewhere I go is near my house
I realised my <malay>tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila</malay> ya
like at least at least [ah] fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
(um) not
full time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (err) how to say [ah] they ask me to apply <malay>tapi macam</malay> a bit weird [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I was telling one of the colleague <malay>macam</malay> the colleague there [lah] the staff there there was like
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then (uh) what <malay>macam</malay> (um) so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then I think the (uh) my my (um) the staff there <malay>cakap</malay> (uh) the is the one you are interview [lah]
then <malay>macam</malay> like so weird the is actually my technically my supervisor [lah] then then she on the first day I came in for my <malay>macam</malay> meet up session <malay>dengan dia</malay> and my reporting officer
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
<malay>sampai padahal</malay> they just want to get to know me better [lah]
so cute [ah] then she ask me [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you can go this option this option then <malay>apa itu</malay>
(um) then she ask me if I want to continue working [lah] at the same place <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> internship <malay>itu</malay> then I <malay>macam</malay> (err) not sure [lah] like a bit too far [lah] but
I guess it makes sense [lah] for me to <malay>macam</malay> continue there cause I know the staff there I know like half the clients there
then <malay>macam</malay> in terms of <malay>macam</malay> you know blend in with the team <malay>gitu</malay> like they know it's going to work
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya ya no issues [lah] ya I think
I think internally <malay>adalah macam</malay> issue <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] cause <malay>dia dah macam</malay> cause <malay>ada</malay> change [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> the difference in (mm) <malay>apa</malay> power dynamics I guess much <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be <malay>macam</malay> less
(err) hands on but I think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program [kan] so <malay>macam dia</malay> (um) just suppose head of the homes is actually <malay>macam</malay> a bit restricted [lah]
!haiya! he's like he's the one <malay>yang</malay> actually main person to do the homes and everything but because (um) the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia dah lama dengan kita</malay> [lah] she already do this kind of this job so <malay>macam</malay> when she comes in and station [kan] the office <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] so (err) I think he feels a bit restricted [lah]
ya ya can tell <malay>sikit</malay> [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>dia macam</malay> like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then <malay>macam</malay> cause he got his own way of doing things then <malay>macam</malay> like he doesn't think that we should do this but (err) in a way
I would say that she overrides him
(uh) then <malay>macam</malay> like ya then <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day <malay>macam</malay> like I <malay>dengar</malay> two things [ah] like I think <malay>dia pun macam segan</malay> and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then I <malay>macam</malay> (uh) then <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day <malay>dia cakap</malay> [lah] like I'm not trying to supervise you
but (um) this is how it's going to work [lah] this is how I we used to do it [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> caught in [tau]
ya ya I know
so like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> am I talking too much
ya <malay>macam</malay> like this client he came back from hospital then <malay>dia pakai</malay> taxi then he kept asking [lah]
<malay>lepas itu</malay> (err) I want to
(err) be refunded by for my cab then <malay>apa itu dia cakap</malay>
(err) [oh] last time
(err) the assistant director did this (err) blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask [ah] then
<malay>apa itu</malay> I put in a group chat [lah] where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
(um) ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in [lah]
so then after I (uh) I got the message then the head of the homes came and then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then I <malay>macam</malay> like what what is going on
ya
ya and then <malay>macam</malay> like it felt weird like <malay>macam apa</malay>
like <malay>dia orang punya</malay> procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> I felt a bit (err) and then still some more like sometimes
the like I'm <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
I guess <malay>macam dia orang</malay> treat me a bit like staff there [lah] which I understand [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like
I don't know how they treat their other interns but I think <malay>bila</malay> yesterday too when I met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like I she she thinks that they like I'm treated a bit like staff [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they they allow me to do a lot of things
I guess so good and bad [lah]
I I felt like <malay>macam</malay> still <malay>terikat</malay> [lah] like if I was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> check in <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] like I would have just check in a bit then I would have run with it [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so <malay>macam</malay> like I hold back and then like I keep checking in so <malay>macam</malay> in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client <malay>tidak ada</malay>
like what is it there's no bad impact [lah] on the client at the end of the day [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> two and a half months actually quite short [lah]
like ya but
but at different locations [ah] under different program
(mm) (mm)
I think
<malay>ada</malay> one <malay>satu</malay> grad dip then the other is I think (um) under grad but (err) it's her second practicum
(uh) so I think this company <malay>macam</malay> purposely they take up (err)
they tried to pick up <malay>macam</malay> grad dip <malay>yang pernah kerja</malay>
in the social service ya
ya ya in the social service sector so that <malay>macam</malay> (mm) not train [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you know (uh)
work etiquette [ah] work etiquette <malay>macam</malay> like organisation after awhile <malay>macam</malay> a lot of organization <malay>macam</malay> structured a certain way
and then <malay>macam</malay> there's like cause I know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like there's policy there's guidelines <malay>macam</malay> there's to meet <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> like I roughly know [lah]
[ah] then it's also under so previously my previous job (um) they are the funders ya
so (err)
ya so I kind of know [lah] <malay>punya</malay> mentality where they go they a bit
how to say
they are a bit <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>jaga muka jaga</malay> face <malay>sikit</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> they expect
(err) fast and (err) presentable results
I guess like <malay>macam</malay> when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast [kan] ya so <malay>macam</malay> some of them <malay>macam</malay> resistant some of them <malay>macam</malay> they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or <malay>macam</malay> the society or the community <malay>macam</malay> thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report [lah] to government or which is [lah] can trickle down to usually [lah] cause they always report to [lah]
that's your
so then anything raise up [lah] then blah blah blah <malay>nanti</malay> in the end <malay>turun</malay> to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so <malay>macam</malay> be miracle [lah] miracle workers then <malay>kita cakap dengan dia orang</malay> [lah] it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time <malay>dia orang pun tak nak</malay> someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
it's considered private affairs [what] (uh)
so in the end you have to get consent from them
and then <malay>macam</malay> how to say
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> is a bit <malay>merepek</malay> [lah] at times I feel
they cannot
cannot be that <malay>macam</malay> one case worker has to hold maybe around
(err) I think last time <malay>apa</malay> [eh] eighty cases
then
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer [lah] they wanted I think hundred I was like <malay>kalau</malay> hundred one case <malay>sahaja</malay> can be like <malay>besar gila</malay> because of their complications is are they
ya and then ya that's why
someone who is very minimal <malay>macam susah gila</malay> it's because like it comes and goes [ah] each person <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> this period they are okay some periods not and then also <malay>macam</malay> seasonal you see cause sometimes like
I I think depending on the timing like <malay>macam</malay> chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>macam</malay>
how to say <malay>macam</malay> it ties into their
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
so <malay>dia teringat-ingat</malay> the families [ah] or what how is your relationship with their family [lah] that kind of thing
ya
ya correct correct
ya
you <malay>ketawa</malay>
for like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> reporting period [lah] ya then <malay>macam</malay>
supposed to
supposed to ya
(uh) no no
(um) you have to record down [ah]
but I think <malay>macam</malay> they try to push [lah] <malay>macam</malay> reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that <malay>macam</malay> is singular case work [lah] it must <malay>macam kita buat</malay> group work or something considered under the [lah] because <malay>macam</malay>
it's try [lah] they try to [lah] maximum I think thirty to forty [lah] but then nowadays [ah] cases <malay>macam</malay> complicated you the person itself is not alone [kan] then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah</malay>
and I was like
and <malay>apa</malay>
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for at all
I might [lah] I I will I will look through the #simei# [one] is a new program it it seems like <malay>macam</malay> (um) a a duplication of some of their services so <malay>macam</malay> like
I ask them [ah] what is it about this new program that you want to start (uh) new siting cause <malay>macam</malay> I think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs [lah]
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then [ah]
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference [lah] because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
(uh) people I think can't remember where
(err) I think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred [lah] so then what's the <malay>macam</malay> main difference [lah] between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very (um) <malay>macam apa</malay> exploratory
[ah] so I don't know [lah] what's going on
[oh] no no there's no need to <malay>itu</malay> I have to I apply the usual route [lah]
(uh) ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty [lah]
ya cause I just
<malay>macam</malay> I'm not in the headspace to <malay>cari kerja sekarang</malay>
(uh) like
I just like finished my practicum I just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time I have like exams which I like I haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay (uh)
my line is very small I don't know if it's clear or not but I'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes I move [lah]
so cute
so maybe when I take a break from studying [lah] I start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
I don't know if I want to just continue doing my masters <malay>ke tak</malay> next year is like I I feel <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
it's not that [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> don't know where to go yet I don't know if <malay>macam</malay> is the place for me to do masters like <malay>macam</malay> after one year one point five years of doing grad dip [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like
is it a good place to start like to study [lah] <malay>macam</malay> their profs are good and everything but <malay>macam ada</malay> I don't know [lah] what I want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if I want to take up continuing masters in social work

(mm) no [ah] it just sounds normal to me ya I I don't know [lah] <malay>macam ada</malay> ya
I think I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> something to do with our ears like usually when we
listen to our
voice <malay>macam</malay> I think it's the (um) channel that they go into so <malay>macam</malay> when we hear our voices during our
<malay>apa itu</malay> using recording <malay>ke apa</malay> right ya it sounds weird net factor
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
we're gonna die
what that's so funny
can't imagine we <malay>apa itu sekarang</malay> [what] maybe they gonna do some space travel [kan] <malay>tak sampai ingat</malay> who is it [ah] the guy <malay>yang faizal tak suka itu</malay> no
that's
ya but just [ah] yes
yes he wants to do like space right space travel or something like that right
is it him
you see
I don't know [lah] okay [lah] he got some admirable traits
I guess and then it's like he's from a I think
single I mean single mother household
I if I recall I think so [lah]
I don't know was it him or someone else (ugh)
cannot ask me who about celebrities background [ah]
!huh!
ya I did (uh) !aiya!
why
ya
(um)
okay okay can [lah] I don't mind cause technically <malay>macam</malay> it's either
that areas or like it's my area like which is far for you
(um)
<malay>macam</malay> no (err) no <malay>macam</malay>
parkway parade or like you know north east region <malay>gitu</malay>
actually <malay>macam</malay> ya in terms of connectivity <malay>macam</malay> cycling I think in the east is better
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya good
like (uh)
(uh)
[eh] there is a <malay>dekat</malay> #tampines# there's a eco green park town
it's near to
ya it's near to #tampines# interchange actually
(mm)
I can send it to you but the the pictures are nice I think like I've
she goes to how's #afiqah# [ah]
[ah]
(mm) no
[ah] when was she married [ah]
[ah] [eh]
[eh] I is this the guy <malay>yang</malay> you were the one that ya the one that you <malay>macam</malay> not certain is it this one
okay
[ah] okay okay
I
okay
you never met the guy is it
(mm)
(mm) (mm) okay [ah] nothing [ah]
[eh] is he our age
okay
okay now now where are they staying
[ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] it makes more sense [lah] <malay>habis itu</malay> ya
(mm) (mm)
then sometime <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kalau</malay> the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>ada</malay> [lah] fiction you <malay>pernah dengar</malay>
outside you and the mother-in-law <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>bermesra gitu</malay> but
I think there might be some tension
ya
<malay>dah macam</malay>
(mm)
I think <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>entah</malay> what would what would I know also
<malay>tak macam ada</malay> like female <malay>macam ada</malay> expectations on us like we should <malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kerja</malay> full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then <malay>macam</malay> like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
(mm) like <malay>macam apa itu</malay>
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is <malay>macam</malay> financially <malay>sahaja</malay> [lah] <malay>kasih duit</malay>
ya [ah] ya
but nowadays is like <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay>
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
I know which is like <malay>macam</malay> a bit worrying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think I <malay>tengah fikir-fikir</malay> because <malay>macam</malay>
like I also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility [kan] but then also
is (uh)
like you shouldn't <malay>segan</malay> and not ask for help and then my (mm) then my parents <malay>dia orang tak nak macam</malay> they want to have their own lives [lah] they don't want to be like you know
babysitters so
it's like the only other options I can see is that I <malay>macam berhenti kerja sekejap</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga anak</malay> and then ya and then potentially you lose
(uh) <malay>apa itu</malay> credibility (um) relevancy to the the area that you are in then <malay>susah balik nak masuk kerja</malay>
ya so
so then also like your is lower then you basically rely on your husband [ah] and then <malay>macam</malay> a lot of people tell me [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] what (uh) don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent <malay>macam</malay> like what is going on
ya
ya
ya
I know
four months four months
(mm)
(mm)
ya but at the end of the day <malay>macam</malay> but if you is good [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you only want to have like one kid <malay>sahaja</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> you want <malay>anak kedua ketiga</malay> then when is it going to stop
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
technically <malay>kalau nak masuk</malay> playgroup [lah] it's a nice timing to <malay>masuk balik kerja</malay> and then
you send the kid to play group [lah] then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure [lah] ya so do you want to work part time and then
I don't know [lah] <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> culture not flexible yet
I think ya
so <malay>macam</malay>

so basically (um)
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and (err) so (err)
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything [lah] about his life so
true enough [lah] he is a very (uh) forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an (uh) up point for him [lah] you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
number one (err) it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>abang</malay> why you asking for my name no [ah] upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in (err)
#changi# airport
(um)
and that #changi# airport is what we thought it was [lah] to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why [lah] but of course there's that connotation [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's not it's not really
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it [lah]
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then (um) so now he is (uh) working at (uh) #novena# and he is there because (uh) he wants to do office work and rightfully so [lah] because he wants to (uh) spend more time [lah] with your family
(uh) and
since he has going to move towards
getting married (uh) he thought this the right step [ah] as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound [lah] in why he's doing it okay then he talk about (um)
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay [ah] this one [ah] [oh] every time I do as in [ah] like
was it so difficult to [ah] get this out
so [ah] <malay>dia suka dia suka</malay> in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here <malay>abah</malay> was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got #zina# to sit right beside me
the mirror the mirror side
[ah] middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so [ah] what else (um) okay so I I
[ah] that one I didn't get to ask but that one is <malay>tak tak important [lah] ya
so the other [ah] important part was about his job experience [lah] so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain [lah] actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he <malay>apa</malay> the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
[ah] okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
[ah] that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
[ah]
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact (uh) do you have connect plan that's he look at me like (uh) what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years [oh] we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said [lah] ya [ah] six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and [ah] okay
<malay>apa yang susah sangat</malay>
that's why exactly that's why I say
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and <malay>abah</malay> were very calm about it <malay>tak ada macam</malay> problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that [eh]
[ah] so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was [ah] number one [ah] <malay>apa</malay> there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then <malay>dia tinggal</malay> #pasir ris#
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale [lah] because they want to look for some a place near (err) <malay>istighfar</malay>
because <malay>dekat</malay> (um) the parents place #pasir ris#
ya [lah] but I don't know why they want that place [lah] anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
this is this could have been <malay>boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] [kan] which is to
<malay>bilang</malay> [kan] that you want to (um) do this to both your parents and #zina's# parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that (err) the keys you know then what you have to actually this part <malay>abah</malay> was the one who [ah] already point out I just reiterated the point
<malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>macam terdesak</malay> [kan] you have to like actually have to push for this [ah] then you are making it difficult for both sides
[ah] then he just he just nodded [lah] he he understood (uh) but I was still <malay>macam</malay> thinking [eh] do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here [ah] but I think it's in between [lah] it's in between that apologetic but also <malay>macam</malay> like okay
[ah] he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel [what] <malay>begitu</malay> I say it's not about that [lah] it's about you informing do it properly
correct ya
so (um) ya so that that part they understood [lah] you know what it's it's spilt milk ready [lah] [kan] like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
[ah] then I then I also talk to them [lah] like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan <malay>abah</malay> also want to hear what is his <malay>apa dia punya rancangan</malay> [lah]
(um) then it was very clear <malay>rancangan</malay> is that
the next year somewhere <malay>dalam</malay> march they intend to <malay>tunang dengan zina</malay>
and then
that's why [lah]
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk #zina# whenever #zina# butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then (err)
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet <malay>abah</malay> probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement [lah]
the <malay>nikah</malay> would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] revise plan [ah] [ah] correct
[ah] I also don't want to embarrass [lah] #zina# cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing #zina# session but no point [lah] the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
[ah] then okay then at least say that gives proper time [lah] for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the <malay>abah</malay> was saying you know #zina# just got
(err) just finish studying <malay>jadi apa</malay> the plan in these two years for for her (uh) then this #azram# <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] ya (uh) this is to would be
for #zina# to actually [ah] secure a job
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about <malay>macam</malay> like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me #zina# also needs to work to build up a
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows [lah] that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why <malay>macam</malay> it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple <malay>tak payah tak ada</malay> complication
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working [lah] and you #zena# needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience #zena# hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for #zina# to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children [ah] then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
[ah] that one okay [lah] they bring about the halal thing [lah] so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya #zina# needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
and I and I <malay>pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] that
you
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
grow up
<malay>dia zina pun nak kena</malay> grow up
<malay>asing asing asing masing-masing kena</malay> grow up <malay>tersendiri</malay>
<malay>lepas itu</malay>
grew up together
[ah] so you need give that time <malay>untuk</malay> you both <malay>nak kena</malay> grow up [ah] that's the thing <malay>budak itu diam</malay> [jer] so I <malay>tak puas hati</malay> because like you can just be numb about this whole thing [lah] that is a which is (uh) quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that <malay>abah</malay> is there something you want to (uh) anything you want to ask them (uh) I said ya so [ah] let me check in (um) so
#ashraf# you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
so one thing that I brought out is you both <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>tersendiri</malay> grow
and then
[ah] come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
[ah] then they say
okay for me I (uh) I feel that
<malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>nak kena apa ada</malay> this (uh)
grow up right <malay>memang nak kena ada</malay> grow up <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) growing up needs to needs <malay>perlu berada dalam</malay>
[ah] context <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dari sendiri sebelum kahwin dan selepas kahwin</malay>
<malay>maksud dia</malay> has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
so it's like if he [lah] in the sense that [ah] so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that (uh) growing up takes place both [lah] during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this [ah] so I made it very clear that don't just lip service <malay>dia perlu perbincangan</malay> further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate <malay>abah dengar ini tak mahu</malay> communicate communicate like <malay>tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa</malay> <malay>abah</malay> there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so (um) I think they got it [lah] so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
then after the whole session also I told #zina# and even just now I texted saying that
<malay>kau orang nak kena</malay> sit down <malay>nak kena</malay> plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say [ah] ya [lah] grow grow grow but you just gonna
<malay>tak</malay> work on it you just gonna <malay>macam letak kat tepi</malay> [jer] and just <malay>macam</malay> put it into the back of your mind <malay>tak nak macam</malay>
<malay>apa buat kerja</malay> develop this it's not gonna work
so
of course [lah]
of course I'm not <malay>macam</malay> blind to this [ah]
(mmhmm)
because at the end <malay>itu</malay> mama <malay>dekat</malay> kitchen and (mm) mama <malay>malu malu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti bila kita duduk makan baru</malay> mama <malay>duduk</malay>
anyway I
<malay>dayah tak ada dayah</malay> said she doesn't want to be there also [lah]
so (mm) ya then I told him okay #ashraf# after all that's been said [ah] I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya [lah] I said you have
I didn't say <malay>sembunyi-sembunyi</malay> [lah] I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
(mm)
then
(um) so basically that's it [lah] and then
at least it's it's clear [lah] that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
body gesture and how he interact with #zina# he is very firm he's just firm [lah] it's that not say very firm [lah] but it's firm <malay>macam</malay> whatever <malay>zina macam nak nak tanya</malay> [ah] #ashraf# right do you want water then he will just say
no he will just use
very <malay>macam</malay> he won't just he won't say [oh] it's okay #zina# he he won't
(mm) like
so I can see [ah] and the way he speaks also is <malay>macam</malay> very direct and very
(mm) ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage [lah]
ya
so
ya
ya so it's not <malay>macam</malay> so as as ambiguous as it was [lah] at least it's kind of <malay>macam</malay> very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to [ah] give #zina# time to work [ah] give #zina# time to develop
<malay>kita tak tanya pasal dia punya</malay> family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
sister is working as a librarian but at #changi#
#changi# business <malay>apa</malay> #changi# [ah] ya that one ya that one warehouse [lah] ya so
ya so it's was very easy [lah] then after when he left also I was telling [lah] see how easy and simple #ashraf#
was
by just being upfront
<malay>dia macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know that
no #zina# you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
so <malay>jadi macam</malay>
ya [lah] so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
then <malay>abah abah</malay> is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that <malay>abah</malay> like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay <malay>abah</malay> is comfortable with him already
ya so
like my [ah] that's why it was very simple [lah] because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that [lah] [kan]
so and he also can recognize [lah] the value in it and can recognise why you know #zina# needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that #zina# needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time #zina# would be the one taking care of it
#ashraf# [ah] because (uh)
someone needs to be there at home [lah] he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or #zina's# parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working [lah] and then I then I ask him so (uh) are you exploring the possibility of #zina# working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
[ah] that's something that they will have to <malay>macam</malay> resolve [lah] how but at the very least they are giving #zina# time to grow
(um)
okay [lor] then after then the
in the dining
(uh)
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear [lah] clear and upfront
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been [ah] <malay>apa</malay> been attached to for the three months
[ah] it was okay normal not not that <malay>macam</malay> overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that [ah] the past (uh) he has yet to have the chance to go for <malay>jumaat</malay> players
ever since COVID like <malay>macam</malay> basically he's just trying to share [lah] like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like <malay>macam</malay> he just brought up we were talking about <malay>jumaat</malay> prayers and then we were sharing
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
ya <malay>tak payah macam pening-pening sangat</malay>
[ah] actually after that was a lot more interest <malay>lepas itu lagi</malay> interesting
for example
(um)
was <malay>abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir</malay> [ah] <malay>ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah</malay>
<malay>ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik</malay>
<malay>tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena</malay> [kan] then I said <malay>abah</malay>
<malay>abah nak kena tengok</malay> [eh]
#hidayah# okay you you got two different daughters <malay>abah cakap apa</malay> different both are daughter yes both are your daughters <malay>tapi</malay> there are two different girls two different daughters
okay
#zina# is on the receiving end she is <malay>zina sudah memang nak menerima</malay>
<malay>apa berkahwin hidayah</malay> I don't think she is there yet <malay>dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu</malay>
<malay>pasal apa</malay>
then <malay>zina pun</malay> add in [ah] ya but she says she wants to get married ya <malay>memang dia nak tapi</malay> is she proactive looking no [what] she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors (uh)
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
!huh!
then (uh) then I said so <malay>abah</malay> you need to understand <malay>yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan</malay>
#zina# is receiving #dayah# is not there yet
so <malay>abah kena</malay> recognize that and #dayah# is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say <malay>abah macam habis kita</malay> then I say okay yes I know I I <malay>faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana</malay> now <malay>bila habis sampai bila abah kata</malay>
then <malay>abah</malay> let me give you some advice
if you <malay>nak di</malay> to even
<malay>dijalankan</malay>
<malay>abah (err) mama <malay>bila nak</malay>
<malay>calonkan</malay> or <malay>menunjukkan calon</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> quality
<malay>biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada</malay> quality <malay>dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik</malay> of course <malay>sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam</malay> give up <malay>dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah</malay> just throw [jer] ya then mama say <malay>tapi</malay> the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> australia <malay>itu abah mama tahu tak</malay> he is just a taxi driver then #dayah# will think <malay>macam macam bingit</malay> [lah]
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working [ah] [ah]
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
because he actually (err) <malay>apa</malay> he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to <malay>sewakan rumah ini</malay> so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
#dayah# at is at this stage of her life
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang aku cakap</malay>
that's why I say <malay>cari orang berkualiti berkualiti</malay> is not just about
(mm)
(mm) so we don't know that [lah] !huh!
ya so anyway <malay>jadi macam</malay>
<malay>abah</malay> understood that [lah] I said <malay>abah tak boleh</malay> control <malay>apa dayah nak ini</malay>
<malay>abah boleh</malay> control <malay>kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh</malay> control <malay>itu itu yang abah boleh</malay> control
so I said right now it seem that <malay>dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan</malay> fine <malay>tapi cari berkualiti</malay> this if people are not are <malay>ada</malay> quality and I said <malay>pada abah</malay> it's not about social status it's not about <malay>macam kaya tak kaya</malay> ya it's about the <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match [ah]
basically this this guy ya
<malay>jadi budak ini dengan dayah</malay> are two different people so cannot
that's why
so [oh] anyway going back to #zina# I I told #zina# like
you need to sit down and you really need to (uh)
figure out the plan on how you gonna
<malay>buat apa memperbaiki diri sendiri</malay>
then <malay>membina diri sendiri</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina</malay>
<malay>bersama</malay>
<malay>jangan cakap saja</malay>
plan it out
<malay>tak boleh zina cakap</malay> [ah] ya ya okay I will look at it [lah] <malay>abang</malay> ya
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>cakap abang</malay> [lah] okay
fair enough [lah] if he (uh) considered (um)
cause he then I say (uh) I
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said [oh] I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know (uh) <malay>semalam</malay> that (err) you you are #ashraf# then I was thinking okay how is it <malay>macam mana dia akan menerima ini</malay> [ah] <malay>cara</malay> [eh]
<malay>zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku</malay> like
<malay>nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama</malay> I don't know [lah] but then <malay>lepas itu dia tanya</malay> (err) <malay>abang</malay> your name is #salim# is it [ah] yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me <malay>abang</malay> [ah] like if <malay>macam dia</malay> #satay# <malay>ada banyak</malay> ya then <malay>abang</malay> also can bring back the
so I thought (err) ya that's why it was easy [lah] <malay>macam abang pun cakap</malay> and because like I said
I told #ashraf# that I'm appreciative <malay>yang dia terus terang dia</malay>
<malay>ada apa ada wawasan</malay> [lah] [ah]
<malay>lepas itu abang pun cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak</malay> clear [ah] <malay>habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini</malay>
(uh)
<malay>encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] I thought <malay>macam</malay> the
<malay>macam mana</malay> it went through was good [lah] ya
[ah] #azlina# #azlina# need to <malay>macam</malay> grow up [lah] on this
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how #ashraf# is
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're <malay>macam</malay> like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has [lah] correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what #ashraf# has did did you see or not how #ashraf# did it
I told her [lah] did you see or not what #ashraf# did
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront <malay>tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi</malay>
[kan] daddy <malay>cerita senang</malay> then I say isn't it simple so that <malay>macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru</malay>
[ah] you just have to be upfront [jer] [kan] <malay>senang</malay> and ya [lah] ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
ya
that's why [lah] she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as [oh]
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
#zina# that is not easy-going
(mm)
<malay>aku cakap dengan dia yang</malay> easy-going <malay>dengan</malay> being firm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going [what]
you are not (um) having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
(mm)
that's why during the
during the discussion <malay>dengan ashraf</malay> I was saying #zina#
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study (mm) [ah] <malay>ashraf dengar</malay> [jer] [lah] what he want to say he just (mm) (mm)
that's why #ashraf#
if
(mm) but whatever it is he is already <malay>macam</malay> he never <malay>macam</malay> like show the reaction of <malay>macam</malay> you know or he didn't show it [lah] of being <malay>tak nak tak nak apa</malay> [oh] like shock or what I think he knows [ah] what he's getting into with #zina#
the way
ya [lah] of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya [lah] I agree of course that's why I said they both <malay>tersendiri nak kena</malay> grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed <malay>tersendiri</malay>
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent [lah]
<malay>dia</malay>
I don't think he would [lah] if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
if if <malay>kalau izat buat gitu</malay> then I will tell him off [lah] [eh] <malay>kau kenal dia ke tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa</malay> so we have to be we have to take this step <malay>kita kena (uh) <malay>apa kita mesti</malay>
(err)
<malay>ambil</malay> (uh)
<malay>kegiatan begini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak boleh macam apa ambil</malay> scenario [jer]
push #zina# right
pull
pull
ya
consume
I <malay>faham</malay>
step up
no [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan</malay> no
(mm)
so ya basically concludes the whole thing [lah] with
#zina# and #ashraf# then
I was two zero <malay>abah</malay> open this topic about #dayah# then I was asking #zina# #zina# what have you been talking to #dayah# [lah] about #dayah's# like (err) relationship or [a'ah] <malay>zina cakap</malay> no we don't talk each other !huh!
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya #dayah# and me then ya I understand that you and #dayah# are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what #hidayah# is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
<malay>sekarang dua-dua sudah</malay> try [kan]
<malay>dua-dua sudah</malay> try
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so you tell me <malay>apa nak kena buat sekarang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>nak buat apa sekarang</malay> then <malay>dia sudah</malay> [ah] ya try again [lah] try no
<malay>sudah</malay> try <malay>sudah sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so nak <malay>kena buat apa</malay>
do what you want me to tell you the answer <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I have to give you the answer
!huh!
why you must have the <malay>jawapan</malay> for me
I want to hear from your own <malay>mulut</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya then <malay>kita nak kena</malay> ask someone to help [ah] then <malay>siapa</malay> this someone to help
you [lah] [ah] then
<malay>kenapa</malay> it has to be me to ask you to
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
you know <malay>abang salim kita ada</malay> problem
okay just kind of <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
see things eye to eye <malay>tak boleh macam bersefahaman</malay>
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why <malay>zina kalau</malay> if this were the reverse that let's say you and #zina# you and #dayah#
I had the same kind of argument with me and #izat# I bet you [ah] you and #dayah# would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least [ah] you see [ah] it me and #izat#
<malay>macam mana pun</malay> that has happen [ah] #izat# would still come and apologize to me
I'm doubting you know whether you and #dayah# would apologise to each other
then you did #zina# was saying <malay>macam</malay> like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to #izat#
<malay>macam</malay> like life [lah] about children about
<malay>apa</malay> marriage like that that
ya ya
[lah] <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like how how he (uh) <malay>apa</malay> decided to get married with with #salimah# then ya we have ya before even during during <malay>apa</malay>
during [ah] our <malay>apa</malay> being after being married also we still talk about <malay>macam</malay> certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not <malay>macam</malay> pen pals is not like <malay>macam</malay> like the way I would talk to #faris# for example but
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> things things about personal things I still can talk to him <malay>macam</malay> I can easily talk to him <malay>macam</malay> [eh] #izat# <malay>kau tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam dayah</malay> is like I I can have the conversation with #izat# you know ya I can but <malay>macam</malay>
#dayah# and #zina# will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that <malay>macam</malay>
that's why [lah] that's why it seems it's
ya [lah]
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
no [lah] not really enstranged like even after this one I I have <malay>macam</malay> move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise <malay>dulu lagi tak boleh</malay> apologise <malay>pun dia punya</malay> ego is so big
what the
like have to see it as steps [lah]
so
that I mean like
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to <malay>macam</malay> make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms #hidayah# and #zina# is different they are just happy with being ignored
<malay>dayah zina sudah</malay> give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring #hidiyah#
that's how bad it is [ah] so at least me and <malay>izat kalau kita</malay> disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like <malay>izat macam</malay> has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that <malay>macam</malay> he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>tak nak berbual dengan si salim</malay> no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
how he <malay>macam</malay> best character he needs to learn to work it out
so okay [lah] I think
<malay>kita semua memang</malay> have your own areas of growth but
#dayah# and #zina# is like they just ignore the problem then I say #zina# especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen <malay>nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi kau orang lagi</malay> will be more separated
I can tell that me and #izat# even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
you and #dayah# ready have a problem <malay>bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi</malay> what do you think
this passive aggressiveness <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay> [ah]
and not just <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay> no it's not <malay>tak apa</malay>
(uh huh)
ya I I did I did <malay>macam</malay> tell her [lah] that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that (uh)
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>fikir</malay> how
this is important this <malay>memang mustahak</malay>
that family comes first
that you need to see that
you cannot just <malay>macam biarkan</malay> that this issue (err) to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya [lah] so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
<malay>bersetuju tak</malay>
<malay>nak abang salim tolong</malay>
[ah] first you have to you <malay>setuju</malay> if you <malay>setuju</malay>
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask <malay>hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak</malay> then
we will make it happen
<malay>jadi</malay> it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem <malay>masalah yang dia ada ini</malay> is trust issues #hidayah# doesn't trust her because #hidayah# feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what #zina# has trust issues because things #dayah# is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you [ah] so that's why [lah] trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts [ah] so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] it's just not healthy and you cannot just
<malay>biarkan macam gitu</malay> [jer]
yes so I
mama <malay>abah</malay> just listen so good thing was
mama <malay>abah</malay> willing to hear
and then
mama !wah! at one okay at one point
(mm) <malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
nevermind just (mm)
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like (um) there was one point where (um)
#zina# was (uh) no I (uh) #zina# was saying that she was (um) the reason why <malay>apa</malay> she went on to telling #izat# first because she felt more comfortable talking to #izat#
then I said #zina# since when you are that close to #izat# then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to #izat# then I say rubbish [lah]
then she she <malay>sudah bingit</malay> [lah] <malay>bila kena</malay> rubbish then she walk off
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
she she <malay>kena</malay> already [lah] then she walk off
so that's why I told her ya #zina# you are close to #izat# because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to #izat#
#izat# is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct [ah] but I say you are close to the boys just because of (uh)
(uh) you are close to #izat# just because the boys (uh) with #izat# you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to #izat#
then I say since when you been talking to #izat# since when
all all the
then say ya of recent years it has been the case [ah] that's that's the part I said [ah] rubbish then stop it since when then she already <malay>sudah kena</malay> then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>mana !wah! you are the
you are that close to #izat# then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys [kan]
further studies
[ah] then I then I also
so going back to <malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] we were talking about #zina# and #dayah# and I was asking #zina# who do you think you
need this person the person [ah] to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what #izat# can do this job [ah]
[ah] then #izat# do you think then she's like smile [ah] !aiya! [lah] cannot [lah]
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
(mm) that's why
<malay>jadi sebab dia kena tengok</malay> and understand that this is the situation
(hmm)
<malay>jadi macam bila dayah</malay>
and #zina# sit down together then they can iron this out [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward [one] really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
they just don't see the point in <malay>macam</malay> making sure that they are
you know comfortable
ya of course
true [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh macam</malay> just simply you know say that [oh] this is a one time deal <malay>mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ingat</malay>
ya so obviously it takes steps [lah] it's not <malay>macam</malay> I one time can <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
<malay>apa terus langsung</malay>

alright
ya so the correct so the third year <malay>aku</malay> move out (err) then I was (uh) staying <malay>dekat</malay> my aunty's <malay>punya</malay> place [lah] so what happens is (uh) I was there (uh) for actually <malay>aku duduk kat rumah dia</malay> [kan] for very long it's about
(uh) overstay my welcome is because I think it's too too long [lah] it should be
(uh) I they gave me hints [lah] ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> place for one and a half years ya one and a half years (err) my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way (err) they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then (uh) that was the the time where <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) you know just tried to just tried to to survive [lah] you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof [lah] and then I was you know so that was a good thing [lah]
correct so that was that was (err) (err) you know (err) at the end of the three years then (err) <malay>aku</malay> early this this this year [ah] first of january actually
(err) sometimes okay terms sometimes <malay>tak</malay> okay [lah] so that means <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> she will invite me back [tau] <malay>macam</malay> (um) you know to to her to the family home [lah] but (uh) sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing [lah] you yes (err) so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back
(um) she totally changed <malay>bukan</malay> change <malay>macam apa</malay> [ah] so she totally <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you know she she's more (err) she she literally like (uh) tries to bother about what I'm doing you know (uh) getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> she I don't know whether she realise [lah] that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing [lah] so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me [lah] now (err) but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months [eh] we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
earlier okay okay
(uh huh) okay
okay okay

[ah]
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time [ah] whenever it I'm the same as you [ah] <malay>mesti kalau macam cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak menang</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> in an argument [eh] <malay>kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang</malay> so I'm always <malay>macam</malay> energetically fight back [tau] [ah] passionate <malay>macam</malay> fight back [tau] but nowadays [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through (uh) certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so (uh) <malay>kita macam tak tak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's no more energy to to [ah] to to expand to to argue [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at the most <malay>pun kalau</malay> even if we don't agree [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer [lah] you know it's just you know you just you just stop [lah] just you just don't don't don't speak [lah] but but it's something that I have always (um) like <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really thankful that (um) she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because (err) I I knew back then [eh] I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay [lah] you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because (err) <malay>dia pergi haji</malay> (uh) last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that (uh) she came back and (err) I think I don't know [lah] maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
and then after when she came back ya when she came back (err) she was more (err) you know (err) she was more more able to control herself [lah] her emotions [lah] and on my part also I try to I try to control my own emotions [lah]
ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct
yes correct exactly
yes yes
ya ya ya
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno <malay>tak yang the coklat</malay> Kinder Bueno okay okay I I tell you what's the relation [eh] Kinder Bueno <malay>dia punya</malay> chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it
is it is it is that is that [oh] for me for me I can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart [kan] I will I will [ah] I will be very very (uh) <malay>macam</malay> adamant to to keep to my belief style [ah] so when when I and when I'm that kind [eh] you that no matter what you do right I will not change and I will not follow whatever you say I will just keep to my own <malay>ini</malay> but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing (uh) I will I will melt I will melt and I will just give in [tau]
so I'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this <malay>dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap</malay> I think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego I I think so but now it's a it's a better experience [lah] ya and then <malay>apa</malay>

yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya

[ah]
ya
yup yup yup
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang yang yang ni apa</malay> we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was (uh) the the part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time [kan] so you ask me to apply for <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) opening [kan] <malay>yang yang</malay> ala air steward
ya (err) I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about (uh) I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like [eh] come [lah] just just follow me [lah] you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at <malay>dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>kat</malay> #yishun#
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area <malay>dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>dekat</malay> McDonald's and then <malay>kat luar</malay> and then we were talking about things like illuminati [lah] we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right (um) the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective [tau] which which means okay <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example [eh] I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand [tau] <malay>kenapa dia macam gitu</malay>
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there I I would I would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so (err) and and and it was honestly right my mind [ah] is always a one track thing so let's say for example [kan] <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay I told myself [ah] I I want to become a pilot but (err) I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing [lah] so I I don't have that kind of (err) presence of mind [ah] to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
for me
[oh] right
so so my my life in in this industry [lah] in this aviation industry started out with (um) with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room (uh) on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion [lah] because he wanted to become a pilot himself <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> eyesight (err) <malay>macam tak</malay> (err) how to say [eh] (uh) not hundred percent [lah] not not not not a six six [lah] vision [lah] so (uh) and at that time [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> very strict [kan] <malay>kalau kau punya</malay> eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance <malay>dia lain</malay> [ah] [ah] [tau] yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many actually actually you are right <malay>sebab tu</malay> [eh] they realise [eh] in (err) in (err) eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was which is the air force so <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot [tau] who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because <malay>dah tak boleh apa</malay> because you <malay>dah pakai</malay> you <malay>dah pakai</malay> glasses then that's that's it [lah] you you no more already [lah] no more chance right so [ah] so that was what spurt on my motivation (uh) and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in (uh) so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to (err) (err) start the flying course [ah] so that time (uh) they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents (uh) fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight <malay>macam</malay> familiarisation flight [ah] so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> then after that <malay>apa tu</malay> they they brief us and then (err) they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that [lah] this was a very long time ago <malay>sekarang dah takde lagi</malay> [tau]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition (uh) even further because I felt you know [ah] bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight <malay>dekat</malay> youth flying club [tau] and this was when I was sixteen [lah] when I was up there it was such a different feeling
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet [lah] bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing [lah] that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that [lah] ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could <malay>tapi aku</malay> I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics <malay>macam</malay> science [ah] science <malay>punya</malay> subject [kan] (err) I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
(uh) it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time [ah] I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my (uh) my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so (uh) puzzled because <malay>did cakap apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) [eh] I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics [ah] but your other topics [ah] you <malay>rabak</malay> man you cannot make it why [ah] then I realise that but it was it was (uh) (uh) only way way way later [lah] then I realise that (uh) okay I I I actually
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) I mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which I could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was (uh) just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when I was in I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so I had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally <malay>aku tak boleh bergerak</malay> I was just I I and I still remember that day was my (uh) examination my english paper <malay>punya</malay> examination and (err) I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now [ah] okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
it recurred again ya it recurred again so (uh) that was another dent in my in my in my dreams [lah] basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know <malay>aku pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>punya</malay> air steward <malay>punya</malay> interview <malay>tu yang aku</malay> pass
(err) actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why <malay>aku tak aku tak dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>jadi</malay> (err) air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up [lah] how it all times ties back together
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was (uh) in the you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the because I joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but I was in the and it was this time when I was in the that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation <malay>aku pakai ni aku pakai</malay> my medisave (uh) my my <malay>apa tu orang panggil</malay>
(uh) I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid (uh) <malay>pakai</malay> insurance [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my medical insurance [ah] ya (err) for I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
<malay>apa</malay> working
am I still what
in that in that in in in that [ah] [oh] debt (uh) I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
<malay>ada ada sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>ada ada sikit</malay> (uh) my mortgage [kan] every month is (uh) one point one K (uh) <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) they cut off <malay>aku punya</malay> (uh) eight hundred
so <malay>aku kena</malay> top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future [lah] <malay>aku aku aku</malay> I was thinking [lah] anyway that [one] is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me [lah] which is why I wanted a bigger place (uh) the other reason was because <malay>aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang</malay> [ah] all my baggage my
[eh] I don't mind man I really don't mind <malay>kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat</malay> it's just beside admiralty [jer] also admiralty is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area [kan] and (uh) the it's only about <malay>macam</malay> five minutes
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay> it's not it's (uh) it's it's just opposite the ya it's opposite the it's a residential <malay>punya punya</malay> place [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate (uh) site I was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when I was in the
yes I was there (uh) okay [lah] it was it was (uh) it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is (um) when you are overseas [eh] (err) your how do I put it [eh] you you're considered as an expat [tau] so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration [lah] so that's the reason why (um) most of us [kan] <malay>kita belajar kat sana</malay> we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to (uh) apply with the local <malay>punya</malay> okay so right now right now (err) so okay so so right now what happens is this [eh]
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
so (uh) average [lah] it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level [lah] I'm not I'm not a <malay>macam</malay> senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of (uh) about four K about there [lah] about about (uh) thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes so when COVID happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) I mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the ya they have they have one in the they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so I thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did [lah] and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed <malay>kita dah</malay> sign contract <malay>kita dah</malay> sign #dok# we even we even (err) graduated <malay>kita semua dah</malay> celebrate [seh] we went out drinking I mean
[ah] <malay>tak tak tak tak tak</malay> I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks [lah] along the way there's you know there's <malay>ujian</malay> there's setbacks there's (uh)
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
ya I know right <malay>macam nasib kentang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before [lah] this phrase I know I know
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining [lah] you know in in every ya so <malay>aku</malay> I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to (uh) goes back on track and all that right (uh) I I'm pretty sure [lah] one day [lah] one day I (uh) you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it [lah]
but but for now (uh) I got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
[eh] it's a different skill set [lah] [sia] it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself (uh) being on the drone so when I see it I was like [oh] okay ya [lah] but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do (uh) (uh) that's relatable and that's (uh) you know but I think (uh) they they have already announced <malay>macam</malay> plans [lah] you know
(uh) they want to push us to become (uh) flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is (uh) back to normal again right (uh) I think you know hopefully [lah] hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] #dok# flight <malay>tak boleh</malay>
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen [ah] but if that ever happens [ah] you will know why [ah] you know all about the history behind it [lah] you can tell people [oh] yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya [lah] yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know [oh] my goodness

what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so I think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
those abilities like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] kinaesthetic
[ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you want to be superman <malay>atau pun nak jadi</malay>
batman
[oh] bat sorry batman or iron man okay <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> batman or iron man I would also want a superpower <malay>yang</malay>
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) <malay>dia bukan dia bukan</malay> specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
[ah] so for me [oh] ya teleporting [eh] didn't actually come across my mind until <malay>tadi sebut</malay> teleporting
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
any place of the world you [tau] <malay>macam</malay> harry potter
harry potter there's this
(err) magic spell I forgot [lah] <malay>apa</malay> magic spell [ah]
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot [lah] what's the the magic spell
(mm) [ah] disapparate [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age [ah]
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
goblet of fire cedric diggory <malay>yang ada siapa tu yang</malay> handsome <malay>tu nama dia</malay> [ah]
robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
[ah] if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like <malay>macam</malay> switch on and off
K but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
<malay>budak-budak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kadang-kadang budak-budak pun kita</malay>
<malay>tak faham apa yang dia nak</malay>
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
for me to <malay>macam tahu</malay> what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
I do not want <malay>macam</malay> to be burdened
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> on and off [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya [lah] but
the thing is on and off [lah] I think every superpower <malay>ada</malay> burdensome
telepathy [ah] [eh] sorry <malay>apa</malay>
teleportation [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
but it saves time it's very quick
<malay>cepat</malay>
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
it depends [lah] whether you have more time the thing is people I think people <malay>nak</malay> this
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
<malay>macam kalau duit</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> definitely okay
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
<malay>tolong orang</malay>
okay <malay>apa</malay>
superpower <malay>macam</malay> okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe [ah]
sorry occupational hazard K [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or <malay>jaga</malay> or <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak nangis datang kasi peluk</malay> to <malay>orang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> nothing [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
in the <malay>mata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
but what if <malay>naik lemak</malay>
like they <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay>
work hard themselves
they just expect to be given [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> rich <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] work hard so we just wait for him <malay>apa</malay> to <malay>durian runtuh</malay>
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but I okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
it's something that you think of [lah] but I to me I think you know me as a person [kan] I'm not a person that wants unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
K
but I [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya I know it's just
a superpower
with unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
ya
(mm)
because [ah] okay the thing is something there <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that <malay>apa</malay> I respect it's just that I'm just
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
since you were saying superpower <malay>apa ni</malay> your superpower of unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because I was thinking
if there's if that's if there is someone [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ubat</malay> for COVID nineteen like the perfect <malay>ubat</malay>
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study <malay>belajar macam mana</malay> like
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay>
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
free only <malay>untuk</malay>
K the thing is I think [kan] <malay>kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni</malay> [kan]
probably free depending on what type of <malay>ubat</malay>
but also
subsidised
(err) like singapore singapore doesn't give <malay>macam</malay> a lot of things <malay>percuma</malay> free
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone <malay>betul tak</malay>
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
<malay>apa</malay> you your superpower that you wanted was
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
knowledge you <malay>pun macam</malay> [meh] (uh) <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
<malay>macam kena gaya</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> my personality [lah]
[ah]
or do you want to give me a superhero that <malay>macam sama dengan</malay> I wonder woman
or because I can
that is just [lah]
(mm) wonder woman [eh]
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
wonder woman is just <malay>macam</malay> too feminist [ah]
ya
ya [lah]
so but she can do [oh] she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
<malay>cakap bohong</malay>
about wonder
[orh]
okay
about wonder woman <malay>agaknya macam</malay> most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
<malay>tua</malay>
<malay>dia selalu sama umur habis ke</malay>
ya <malay>lambat gila</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai</malay> <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
she had to watch her <malay>kekasih</malay> die
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
[oh] it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
[eh] then that's boring man
[eh] but they are supposed to
I think they will filming [ah] <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> stop <malay>pasal</malay> COVID nineteen [kan]
[oh] <malay>dah habis filem dengan</malay> production [eh]
[oh] because of COVID nineteen then <malay>tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok</malay> [oh]
[eh] why not [kan] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
people view online [lah]
ya there's [ah] people be ya video on demand
people view
no not apple [lah] then only apple people
only iMac
(mm) something like Netflix [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> okay Netflix is a one time payment (uh) <malay>tapi kalau nak tengok</malay> movie movie <malay>ni</malay>
extra [lah] then technology is already so fast pace
but is it
movie <malay>baru</malay>

Netflix <malay>bayar</malay> per month [lah] because we are using we are sharing accounts right so
no
<malay>untuk</malay> for us <malay>saje</malay> [lah] but I'm not too sure how much but
actually like
this production <malay>macam</malay>

<malay>tiga puluh minit empat puluh minit</malay>

[ah]
because of time
(mm)
I want to save time <malay>pasal</malay>
okay the thing is I know you have a problem <malay>dengan</malay> with me
<malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>suka cepat cepat cepat boleh tengok</malay> movie fast forward fast forward
but you must understand my my feel
okay the thing is I told you already [kan]
<malay>otak</malay> I <malay>macam</malay>
runs very fast
no the thing is the details
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak tahu</malay>
if I want to know
I will read about it
ya or I will go back
if <malay>macam</malay> if <malay>betul-betul mustahak</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>kalau tak mustahak</malay>
<malay>cepatkan saje</malay> because
like you know I have a lot of things to do
like
<malay>kemas rumah</malay>

<malay>cepat tengok</malay>
<malay>cepat tidur lebih tidur</malay> (mm) <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] (uh)

ya <malay>nanti</malay> [lah] next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy <malay>gila</malay>
ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare
not because of the [tau] but because of the house itself you want me tell you the story
no it's not haunted
not son of a peach <malay>punya</malay>
it is our oldest house
(err) block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so <malay>masa</malay> I <malay>kecil-kecil</malay> there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
ya
then there will also be <malay>macam ada bau tak sedap</malay> [ah] but okay my family <malay>tak kena sangat</malay> [ah] but our neighbour <malay>pernah</malay>
<malay>nak dengar</malay> ghost story
so my neighbour I think <malay>tingkat dua</malay> we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think <malay>pukul sepuluh ke apa</malay> there was somebody who came over to their house <malay>macam</malay> you know the <malay>makcik-makcik jual keropok</malay> (err) they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open [ah] so it it was a <malay>makcik</malay> selling cake <malay>tunjuk</malay> the cake all that so <malay>macam</malay> my neighbour <malay>kasihan</malay> then my neighbour <malay>pun beli</malay> [lah] the cake
so the <malay>makcik dah</malay> go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a <malay>batu nisan</malay> inside
(err) I can't recall the exact time the exact year but I think it was when I was in secondary school around there [lah]
mine was like maybe in the early two thousands [ah]
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like <malay>tersipu-sipu</malay>
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents <malay>punya</malay> renovation so they just got the key on #deepavali# like after like one month of extension then that [one] also like a little bit of a <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it <malay>sebab dorang dah</malay> change <malay>dorang punya</malay> address
<malay>abeh entah</malay> [lah] like very #niao# [ah] so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november #deepavali# is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend <malay>yang</malay> they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so (err) eventually on fourteen november they got the key then (um) we went to the house the next day #taufik# <malay>pun pergi</malay> the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime <malay>cuci</malay> [jer] <malay>keluar</malay> like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to <malay>beli</malay> the odour eliminator [ah] spray around a few times I think (err) we went on sunday last spray for the things then (err) I went again on monday
the next day [ah] the next day <malay>bau masih tak hilang</malay> [ah] cause twenty cats [seh] so spray spray spray <malay>lagi</malay> still <malay>tak hilang abeh bila</malay> I <malay>balik</malay> I was like having like a huge headache then (err) eventually I call (err) <malay>macam</malay> professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser <malay>juga</malay> so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces [ah] so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>nak buat dia</malay> [eh]
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>ni ada berapa kucing ni</malay> [seh] <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>ada ada</malay> twenty cats <malay>dia macam</malay> !wah! <malay>teruk</malay> [seh] but he was like telling us that (err) okay [ah] the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so <malay>dia pergi dekat</malay> switch then he call us [lah] say [eh] I think this house <malay>ada pijat punya</malay> infestation <malay>juga</malay>
because apparently on top of the switch <malay>ada</malay> colour black black black which is actually an indication of <malay>tahi pijat</malay> [ah] so he was like hopefully all the <malay>pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali</malay> [ah] the all the bed bugs <malay>semua</malay> but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be <malay>pijat</malay> or not so yes but yesterday my mum <malay>pergi dah tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> so I guess it worked but
hopefully the smell won't stay [lah]
ya (err) the <malay>pijat</malay> is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change [ah] so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went <malay>tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay> (um) I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat</malay> the living room so <malay>macam</malay> we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay [lah] but end up the cause they went again <malay>macam</malay>
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension [kan] so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow [lah] <malay>dorang tak kasi</malay> then <malay>dah jadi</malay> my parents house <malay>apa</malay> so my parents <malay>pergi tu yang</malay> they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there !oi! <malay>kalau</malay> I think if my parents <malay>tahu pun</malay> they wouldn't have the house [lah] but no <malay>momok</malay> so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke</malay>
ya
<malay>apa bunyi tu</malay>
okay [lah] okay how's your job finding going on

okay mendaki
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense <malay>pun dorang</malay> will go to like some companies
!aduh! <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
I initially I was also thinking whether I should find a like a full time job cause now mine is adjunct right but then now my adjunct is getting too busy
or not really I mean <malay>tak ada</malay> bonus [ah] and all that <malay>apa</malay> ya as long as still something [ah] like my dad got a job my dad [kan] <malay>masa tu kena</malay> retire he got a job <malay>pun tu tak dapat</malay> bonus <malay>ke apa</malay> so that [one] is that only contract for one year ya
ya hopefully everything get better
[oh] that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family <malay>kat</malay> airport for like one minute to <malay>lambai-lambai</malay> only
ya but (um) he also <malay>kena</malay> so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants <malay>semua kena</malay> stay at crowne plaza so ya [lah] they only like <malay>macam</malay> see each other <malay>bila</malay> my brother <malay>keluar dari</malay> the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his (uh) daughter <malay>cuma lambai</malay>
his family had been here since march so my brother has been stuck in qatar for seven months without family
but <malay>tak boleh jumpa</malay> [what] is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother <malay>dah lama tak makan makanan melayu</malay> right so
he requested for <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for <malay>apa benda tu nasi ambeng</malay> or is it #laksa# one of it [lah] then <malay>malam</malay> he asked for <malay>bandung</malay>
missing all the local food simon to either <malay>macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
(err) they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still <malay>macam makanan</malay> the variety is not as much [lah] ya
I am not the target audience
what [oh] mama high class you <malay>tak tahu ke</malay>
ya precisely is what five digit figure [eh] I don't know
okay [lah] still not worthy
because ya we are not the target audience
I I was about to ask halal or not halal
mama very particular [what]
ya I agree
ya but mama high class [lah] that time [ah] she was watching her japan show [eh] at at your house [lah] then she texted me (err) #nura# <malay>masa tu kita ada</malay> stay <malay>dekat</malay> hotel #tokyo# one one of the #atas# hotel [lah] then I say no we didn't stay at the #atas# hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like !wah! <malay>situ ada makanan</malay> halal
<malay>abeh</malay> I said but we also eat <malay>makanan halal apa</malay>
ya [lah] but maybe let mama stay in dorm try
actually if <malay>apa</malay> right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb [ah] then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very <malay>macam</malay> open to try food ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> she said like <malay>macam</malay> okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really [lah] we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point [kan] you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> #ramen# <malay>tu</malay>
surprisingly she eats #ramen# right but she doesn't eat (um) sushi #sashimi# [kan]
[oh] <malay>kita orang tak bawa pergi</malay> [ah] #sashimi# sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya #ramen# #miso# but not sushi she say she [oh] <malay>tak makan</malay> seaweed [kan] so <malay>tak bawa</malay> [ah] but all the rest <malay>dorang makan banyak</malay> obese <malay>apa</malay>
no idea ya like even the (um) <malay>balik punya</malay> flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
okay [lah] some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
I agree [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi lemak</malay> I still prefer the silk air <malay>punya</malay> have you tried [ah]
[oh] my god the silk air <malay>punya</malay> is so nice ya [oh] I think out of all the (err) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> okay [ah] not counting like parents masak semua</malay> [kan] silk air <malay>nasi lemak</malay> is like up there ya but you cannot choose [what] so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with <malay>nasi lemak</malay> or not
like people say malaysia <malay>punya nasi lemak sedap</malay> [kan] I think silk air [one] that [one] is <malay>sedap</malay>
so I was telling #taufik# like maldives [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> island [kan] like can you open up one island just for singaporeans <malay>untuk</malay> okay [what]
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay [lah] then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also
ya like that that would benefit both countries hello
I think <malay>ni kena</malay> write in to maldives <malay>nya</malay> government [kan]
(mm) now is hong kong but hong kong got so many riots okay I don't know whether the protest are still ongoing but ya I it's not one of my to go list
I haven't been there before [lah] but if I'm going there is only because just to check off the list but I feel that hong kong will be no different from singapore actually I want to go #nairobi# #nairobi# kenya it looks nice I have been following random people on instagram then they have been instagram #storying# their lives right so it's surprisingly for this particular day was a lot of kenyan people so the location was #nairobi# they have really nice homes you know it's like ya [lah] it's quite nice [ah]
you can do the safari tour there
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [eh]

that time I went seychelles I fly from qatar and then I want to seychelles
ya
I don't have qatar membership I only have a brother
ya [lah] for as long as he stay there I'm going to like <malay>betul-betul tekan</malay>
flying some of his friends have been retrenched like (err) he's flying A three fifty so a three fifty <malay>ada banyak</malay> flights so during the COVID period he has been to canada he was in new york he was in seattle he was in singapore he was in melbourne (err) where again
he was in adelaide brisbane then singapore indonesia it's like [eh] I thought COVID period you still flying around
(err) he's still the initial part he flew a lot to europe france and italy because they will like evacuating their citizens
<malay>abeh</malay> the later later [one] <malay>banyak</malay> like holiday people ya but qatar <malay>dia punya</malay> border control is still strict not like <malay>macam</malay>
they allow a lot of people to come in [ah] like people they can go to they don't have to quarantine even people from india they can so what I read [lah] on facebook like these indians they want to come to singapore and
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to <malay>lepaskan</malay> the requirement of the singapore government [ah] <malay>lepas tu baru</malay> they fly to singapore expert
okay [lah] not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore [ah] like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian <malay>punya banyak</malay> like <malay>jiwang-jiwang</malay>
or <malay>rindu</malay> family <malay>cakap dua minggu</malay> [jer] <malay>sekarang dah lapan bulan</malay> that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore <malay>banyak</malay> [oh] where is the class for this (err) <malay>ataupun</malay> rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through

<malay>tengah tak ada</malay>
you should
(mm)
but actually five year at #ubi# ones are not bad <malay>macam</malay> like my house <malay>kalau dah</malay> five year and a lot of people [kan] <malay>jual</malay> the the house if they take care of their houses actually it's not bad it's if you get the previous owner <malay>yang teruk tu yang</malay> ya ya you have a lot of things to do but I'm sure like if if we sell your house you will buy right
the five year [one] [ah] is one that you can consider <malay>cuma</malay> maybe you have to do the toilet [ah]
our is not cement
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles <malay>yang macam</malay> like a little bit <malay>kasar-kasar</malay>
ya but it it feels nice right
ours is not it looks like cement's grey but it's not
skirting I think is necessary [ah]
ya
(mm) should be okay [lah] ya
that [one] I don't know how they do it but it could be because they customise their wardrobe all that that [one] will take a lot of that [one] quite expensive [lah]
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good <malay>cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi</malay> I don't know where they go
<malay>apanya</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] like competition
ya ours <malay>macam</malay> the my sister <malay>punya</malay> is like newer <malay>tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah</malay> ours <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> the door [kan] <malay>yang dia punya</malay> handle is quite solid but my sister <malay>punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka</malay>
hers was wait [ah] how old is my niece my niece is two years old [kan]
[ah]
two year two years
[ah] she bought it two years ago
[kan] <malay>abeh dia punya tempat masak</malay> the hood <malay>dah jatuh-jatuh</malay>
[ah] the the
ya and the brand is bosch
supposed to be quite #atas# [hor]
and mine is like some cheapo techno brand still going on strong
ya so if you want to buy buy techno <malay>jangan beli</malay> bosch
ya buy cheap or like you have to do your homework [ah] like have to really read up but then again you read up they will say that bosch is good but experience tell me no
[ah] ya ya <malay>kena macam ada</malay> talk forum
ya okay [lah]
then after a few years you <malay>kena tukar</malay> [kan] ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it <malay>masa kita orang pergi</malay> that's why it's like (um) it's
(um) it's a little bit more #atas# than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the <malay>dia punya tu macam</malay> fulfilling <malay>macam</malay> very #atas# kitchen
ya correct
you you can check it out [lah]
okay [lah] I why they didn't choose quartz that time [oh] cause <malay>kita orang pemalas</malay> they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz <malay>jadi sebab kita nanti</malay> take the pot <malay>terus letak</malay> on the kitchen counter
#taufik# and I are the <malay>pemalas</malay> kind
granite the good thing is ya [lah] if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous <malay>pastu</malay> (um) <malay>tak banyak</malay> choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you <malay>kena buat</malay> sealing <malay>dia</malay> [lah] but <malay>kita orang tak pernah buat</malay> <malay>abeh nampak macam</malay> still okay <malay>apa takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>malas</malay> ya
mama know that you are coming here today
<malay>abeh dia tak cakap nak ikut ke apa ke</malay>
ya [lah] sheng siong more important than us

<malay>dorang nak tutup</malay> the temporary interchange to <malay>pindah</malay> to another temporary interchange [kan] did you read

I work [oh] wait before I start working or is still the old [one] <malay>pastu</malay> I work the <malay>pindah</malay> to the temporary interchange and then I <malay>dah</malay> quit work <malay>dah</malay> three years with nparks <malay>baru pindah</malay> to another temporary and then last I read another ten years <malay>baru siap</malay>
at the current temporary [one]
so I <malay>cakap</malay> hillion <malay>dah siap dan</malay> #yishun# <malay>punya dah siap</malay> and then [ah] yes correct I think woodlands <malay>punya pun</malay> will be done before the #jurong# [one] will be done who the [ah]
!oi! #arman# what you doing
really [leh] they say and then the science centre they say what twenty twenty will have the new [one] [kan] what happen now
<malay>ada masa</malay> the fifty was it [ah] fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty (err) <malay>apa</malay> they will move the science centre then science centre <malay>masih kat tempat lama</malay> !aduh!
they wanted to move closer to lakeside so apparently it's supposed to be like the jewel of lakeside you know
ya
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] ya I mean I would prefer at #jurong# [lah] cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be <malay>macam dekat dengan</malay> water feature <malay>entah</malay> [lah] but [oh] they said after that (err) they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground (err) ya
until now I don't see any breaking the ground
<malay>abeh</malay> before COVID <malay>kenapa tak nak</malay> start
<malay>apa</malay> [jer] !aduh! well that's #jurong# for you <malay>tapi</malay> #jurong# <malay>punya rumah mahal</malay>
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news <malay>kata</malay> that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is <malay>ada ke tidak</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>beli rumah nak beli kat mana</malay>
but #clementi# is so ex
they will also want you to be nearby
mahal</malay> [seh] the resale can be like four hundred five hundred
!wah! but three fifty will be like the further further areas [kan]
no it's just too expensive actually [kan] #taufik# and I were like looking to upgrade <malay>ke tidak</malay> [tau] cause like we were thinking [lah] that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over [lah] but we don't have any extra room [what] so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
ya we changed our fan we (um) clean up the aircon call the air con guys so (err)
ya that that's the most
we we were thinking of that but the thing is <malay>tapi sebab entah</malay> (err) like that [lah] slowly [lah] ya then <malay>apanya</malay>
we like the house <malay>punya</malay> location you know <malay>bawah</malay> there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery <malay>tak</malay> you don't see like into neighbour <malay>punya rumah</malay> so <malay>nak cari</malay> like really our criteria <malay>susah</malay>
like our neighbours are also okay <malay>pastu</malay> we have like area <malay>kat rumah</malay> to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>dorang pun dapat menikmati</malay> all the <malay>pemandangan-pemandangan</malay> plants <malay>yang</malay> #taufik# <malay>bawa balik</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok</malay> our area quite nice <malay>jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok</malay> !alah! <malay>tak ada pokok besar</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ</malay>
(mm)
ours is [ah] indonesian the wife is indonesian the husband is singaporean
<malay>ada anak satu</malay>
the (err) primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also (err) too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't [ah] I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay [lah] actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays [lah]
no I want my holidays during off peak period
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to <malay>pun tak</malay> crowded then ya then cheap and the <malay>tak</malay> crowded is the most important criteria
[oh] ya <malay>sekarang</malay> parents <malay>semua ada</malay> whatsapp chat right
(mm)
kindergarten
<malay>nak kena cebok</malay>
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours [one] also
<malay>pecah-pecah</malay> but we don't mind [lah] cause we know that you can always put back [what] but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very <malay>pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam</malay> like <malay>perempuan apa melayu terakhir</malay> [eh]
so that's why <malay>bawa dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> wash hands <malay>semua pastu keluar dia nampak</malay> lego [jer] <malay>terus macam</malay> hundred and eighty degrees turn [ah] like (oo) what's this <malay>pastu ambil</malay> then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see #taufik# <malay>punya dorang tak faham</malay>
because star wars [kan] so all the (err) <malay>apa</malay> all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take [seh] and then one of the transformer cup [ah] you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said [oh] what's inside then she actually open up
and <malay>macam</malay> take out all the mini fixed [ah] !aduh! and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old <malay>pastu dah dah dah</malay> do a lot of things [lah] then start riding a bicycle [oh] <malay>dah</malay> can understand a lot [ah] [oh] she can <malay>baca ayat kursi</malay> also
ya
ya <malay>kalau dekat</malay> schools <malay>nak</malay> deal with the parents <malay>pastu</malay> to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other !wah! <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] (mm) ya [lah] that [one] is also like my last priority
yes last resort (mm)
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment [kan] so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing [lah] but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
what's that ya for the seven years I <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah] at least this [one] it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain <malay>pun tak mendak sangat</malay>
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
yes correct <malay>dah hafal sangat</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> tuition like
[oh] maybe I just don't handle stress well
[ah] like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second [one] so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
[oh] dear actually why they why <malay>madrasah tak ambil</malay> like the (err) trained teachers [ah]
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that [one] I you know [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I'm not too sure
and my sis <malay>nak hantar</malay> my niece <malay>masuk madrasah</malay> [tau]
[ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> so next year my niece three years old then <malay>dia nak hantar pergi</malay> those <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>hafal quran punya</malay> classes all that
they have been trained
(mm) so don't know [lah] cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so <malay>dia kata takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak hantar</malay> the my niece <malay>pergi masuk madrasah</malay> so let's see how it goes anyway <malay>baru</malay> two years old [seh]
ya amazing
ya <malay>asalkan</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really <malay>macam</malay> plan out everything for their children

ya I that's my comfort food
<malay>orang tengah sedih kena makan</malay> comfort food then after that gain weight after that <malay>gemuk</malay> after that (uh) regret
<malay>semalam</malay> ya I went out to go to the hospital <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak dapat jumpa</malay> #haziq# [lah] cause (err) <malay>dia tengah rehat</malay> so I just <malay>duduk kat bawah</malay> [jer] ya what about you
<malay>belajar makan</malay> [eh] <malay>makan apa kat situ</malay>
(mm) true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars #nasi lemak# at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like (err) but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then (err) the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
no I always go to the #choa chu kang# [one] cause I gym <malay>kat</malay> #choa chu kang# ya so sometimes after work I go to #choa chu kang# to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue (err) I will join is an electronic queue [lah] so I will go there scan the code then (err) I will join the queue then after that (err) they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box <malay>punya</malay> queue management system is like that
[oh] ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about (um) just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya #choa chu kang#
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't [oh] okay I remember I went to [oh] cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
but (err) in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym [ah] then cause my gym <malay>dia punya bawah ada</malay> this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food [oh] shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets [oh] damn
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like (um) it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this [one] is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it [lah] so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in #choa chu kang# doesn't have a shower
later like what time
(err) the burger (err) I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what [ah] I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
right because our house area <malay>tak ada</malay> burger king <malay>dah lama</malay> then this is the newest [one]
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella [eh] no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom [eh] the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the <malay>apa tu</malay> the mozzarella cheese burger to other people <malay>tapi kalau</malay> if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead [lah]
ya don't know [ah] it's just like I I like it that way [ah]
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in
[oh]
where
(mm)
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
[oh] okay okay okay
[oh]
[oh] okay wait what is this cafe called again

[oh] !wow! that's interesting (um) so why did you guys want to go there
(mm) [oh] ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
[oh] and that's enough for him
(mm)

then I park at this super far away <malay>punya</malay> car park cause <malay>dia punya</malay> parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price (err) all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price <malay>macam</malay> two dollars sixty cents (uh) sixteen cents [ah] ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before [kan] so
but when I went there I <malay>takut</malay> like because it's quite #ulu#
<malay>dorang cakap ada</malay> shuttle bus [ah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> because I'm gonna go there at night so I <malay>takut</malay> like
(uh) <malay>kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti ada benda</malay>
so I was super scared about that so like (err) when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there [lah] to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe [kan] I just parked right smack in front of the lift
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like <malay>kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut</malay> ya ya then like I think cause it was so #ulu# so when I waited a I parked my car [kan] then after that I waited for the shuttle bus <malay>kat bawah</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> like <malay>dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok</malay> [jer] probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> wearing office clothes #ish# #ish# [lah] I was wearing with jeans [ah] the top <malay>macam</malay> (uh) like office <malay>punya punya baju</malay> [lah]
ya then after that <malay>dorang tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini</malay> #ulu# #ulu# <malay>punya tempat</malay>
ya so I <malay>tapi tak kesah</malay> [lah] so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the <malay>makan</malay> place the <malay>kaki makan tu</malay> ya and I ate my favourite (err) what's that called the #lor mai kai# ya
then I wanted to buy <malay>dia punya</malay> what's the one that we ate that time [oh] <malay>dia punya</malay> honey barbecue #bao# the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time <malay>dorang tak ada semua dah habis</malay> so they only had like #siew mai# and #lor mai kai# and the typical #nasi lemak# so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the #nasi lemak# so I just got the cause the #lor mai kai# itself is already quite big right
#nasi# [ah] sorry I ate the #lor mai kai# then I ate the then I order three #siew mai#
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that #lor mai kai# got the like the wok !hey! taste ya [oh] my god ya so that's why like !wah! I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the #lor mai kai#
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then (err) when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles [kan] so <malay>dorang cakap</malay> (uh) noodles the person who cook the noodles (uh) only available <malay>sampai pukul enam</malay> then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay [lah] (uh) #inshallah# next time <malay>ada rezeki boleh dah makan</malay>
<malay>makan</malay> noodles <malay>dia</malay> there was this (err) it's a bit like #ban mian# ya it's it looks a bit like #ban mian# but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to <malay>makan</malay> ya like you just craving [kan]
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook <malay>dah dah balik rumah</malay> [lah] so I just like okay <malay>tak ada rezeki</malay> then ya then (err) ya then I ate there then (err) the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right <malay>dorang tutup</malay> (uh) <malay>pukul tujuh</malay>
[eh] <malay>pukul tujuh</malay> [eh] <malay>pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan</malay> ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay <malay>sampai kul sembilan</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi</malay> (uh) they allow me to sit <malay>dekat luar dia punya</malay> outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor [lah] it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya <malay>macam</malay> in a way communal area [lah] <malay>tapi ada meja</malay> so okay [lah] so I <malay>makan</malay> there I <malay>duduk</malay> there <malay>sampai pukul sembilan gitu</malay> then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya !wah! ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like (err) cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
I didn't see anything at the #ulu# car park [ah] parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital [kan] ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
ya but #alhamdulillah# ya [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak nampak apa-apa</malay> then I just <malay>balik rumah</malay> [jer] [lah]
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
[eh]
I hope that we can play badminton later [seh]
ya I think so we still have like <malay>macam</malay> forty minutes to go
ya
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the <malay>selimut</malay> then after that you just sleep ya [sia] it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun [lah]
ya too windy I think too much but I think
ya ya <malay>tapi</malay> I saw <malay>kat sebelah dorang ada</malay> roller the want to roll the floor (err) when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> it like last time when I <malay>tengah main</malay> netball [kan] I always use that roller to spread out the rain
so that (err) they all evaporate faster something like that [lah] I have no idea how the science works [ah] ya okay let me see what are the prompts (um)
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know [lah] I like to travel the world [kan] ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home <malay>tidur</malay> one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay [lah] ya okay I need to aim to be like you
damn what who who is that celebrity
[oh]
ya that's true
that is a very is #hyorin# right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
(mm)
[oh] damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how [oh] !chey!
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy [oh]
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor [kan] but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
(mm) !wow! that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay (um) do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
(mm) stereotypes [ah]
ya I get what you mean [ah] ya is a bit (err) a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that [one] it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is [oh] you malay [ah] you in uni [ah] [oh] so you are one of the what [ah] a smart malay [ah] they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before [lah] but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya [lah] I know I know recently also like especially during (um) the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya I I saw a few videos on it [lah] during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker <malay>tak ada apa-apa nak buat</malay> [kan] ya so I just <malay>duduk rumah tengok</malay> video like in a way very sensitive content just <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me [oh] you went from then go to !wah! smart [ah] then in my recent job interview <malay>pun dorang tanya</malay> [oh] I think your academic background is very good
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so (err) !aiya! don't know [lah] I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like [oh] okay okay okay but ya like like quite #sian# [ah] to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that (err) everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say [lah]
he's on what on the ship [oh]
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for (um) youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths [ah]
ya so like those (err) from what I understand is more of like those people <malay>yang dorang nak lari dari rumah</malay> (uh) <malay>dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that <malay>pun</malay> ya <malay>selalu gaduh kat rumah</malay> and all that <malay>gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu</malay> that kind ya so (err) that is what <malay>apa tu</malay> Mendaki is trying to do [lah] ya this was (err) last year
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up [lah] because (err) even though to me [lah] like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe [lah] #inshallah# like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do [lah] so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the !wah! the interview was like what like <malay>dua jam</malay> [siol] ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya (err) I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know <malay>dorang punya</malay> volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of <malay>adab</malay> in terms of your <malay>akhlak semua</malay> (uh) <malay>boleh</malay> pass [lah] ya like <malay>macam</malay> there is no <malay>macam</malay> red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people <malay>yang betul betul</malay> need help [ah] ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then <malay>macam</malay> (err) Mendaki has to answer in a way [lah] so I I understand where they are coming from
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did [ah] I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
very english [lah] like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible [kan] ya but then now I mean I am improving [lah] in a way in my malay (err) language exposure ya so like when I (err) my my question to them was like I am <malay>macam</malay> in a way
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to (err) and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me [lah] like your just be like your problem is different <malay>apa kau</malay> [kan] <malay>anak-anak orang kaya</malay> that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of [lah] my intention was to help them <malay>tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu</malay> (uh) they don't want me to help then
like I I don't know [ah] like I just cannot cannot handle it [lah] ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like [oh] don't worry [lah] I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is [lah] ya cause (err) one of the mentors was telling me that like (err) he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so !wah! I'm like !wah! if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so <malay>macam</malay> to be honest in a way I just lost confidence [ah] like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life <malay>macam</malay> still <malay>huru-hara</malay> so I need to let it get it settled first [lah] don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
[oh] damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
[ah] [ah] okay let's look for one more question (mm)
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free [eh]
that's true but technically also isn't it like
like it can be a controversial opinion <malay>tapi macam</malay>
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing [what] right ya
(mm) ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as <malay>macam</malay> maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then <malay>macam dorang tak boleh</malay> they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard [lah] like you know like how they say equality versus what [ah] equity
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that (um) analogy [lah] ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more [lah] ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that [lah]
ya [oh] my god my throat
!hey! [oh] ya okay then for me what was the question again [ah]
(um) my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free [eh] food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer (um) if something was free [ah] can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya [lah] like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya !wah! it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored [leh] if I were immortal
no [oh] my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy [ah] okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just (um) and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them [lah] basically
aesthetics ya [sia] okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift (hmm) will the werewolf be the shape shifting [one] maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to (um) the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then (um) I don't know would you rather be like

bro <malay>aku</malay> #frus# [ah] bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game <malay>aku punya bingit</malay> which man U game the one with crystal palace [ah]
ya (err)
K K K admittedly <malay>macam macam budak-budak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam main dengan</malay> boy look look at look at #wilfried# freaking #zaha# what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
no thanks to david #moyes# we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back (um) bit our hand back
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about #gareth bale# and #sergio aguero# and and #thiago#
and you associated with all of them
but [oh] look <malay>dia pun</malay> sign the only work
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya [ah] the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about #thiago# he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in #barcelona# central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database <malay>pakai</malay> football manager <malay>semak</malay>
I can't believe [sia]
david #moyes# <malay>kat mana dia baru lawan</malay> #arteta# last week
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham [a'ah]
when did they ever not lost okay [ah] to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean [ah] but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
#arteta#
plus minus [ah] plus minus [ah]
[eh] but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna <malay>angkat</malay> again [ah] the <malay>korang punya</malay> the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular #thiago#
<malay>dia punya</malay>
he knows his a level above everybody else [ah] no but but K you know there's this two theories of
(err) two types of players football theory [eh] two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers [kan]
[ah] the likes of
#guardiola#
and #pochettino# and #martinez# and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis #van gaal# [ah] #ajax# school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis #van gaal# is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but (err) no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective [ah] okay (err)
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent [ah]
he does basically [ah]
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen [ah] in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis #van gaal# school of control
wait then then I have the flip side [ah] the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually #merino# takes everything that is strong about louis #van gaal# and finds the witnesses so like louis #van gaal# takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using #merino# flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing [ah]
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the #barcelona# against #inter milan# <malay>punya</malay> game [ah] #barcelona# [ah] [eh] sorry (um)
bionic #inter milan# game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but #inter milan# won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is (err)
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's #mourinho#
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin [ah]
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick #zambia lonso#
(err) (err) schools that kind of control #zavi iniesta# chaos player
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't #van gaal# doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone <malay>yang terus</malay> shoot the ball [tau]
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so (err) he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why #van gaal# and #cryuff# although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
#cryuff# emphasise more on individual creativity #van gaal# is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what #mourinho# exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
[ah] basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to <malay>kelam kabut</malay> he lose the ball there
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre [ah] #mourinho# he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
ya but #klopp# he he demands the intensity and that <malay>kelam kabut</malay>
opposites outside of the spectrum for one #klopp#
he
#klopp# denies his space
yes
correct for

okay
so you are talking about <malay>macam</malay> child molesting kind of
movies
okay
okay okay talking about children [eh]
okay talking about children <malay>aku baru berbual dengan bini aku</malay> a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all netflix movies or shows for free
[eh] you fall you know it could be a someone sign for me up an account so anyway (err)
okay <malay>bini aku</malay>
!ee! like when my it can be installed in my phone [ah] not just an Android box
it's an [ah]
<malay>aku ada</malay> Android box but also the smart <malay>pun</malay> can install there
[ah] you can install on smart Android box
as long as it's Android it can be installed [ah] in other words whatever the physical shape
it's an [ah]
okay so <malay>bini aku</malay> past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing [tau] about how
(uh) in the last week or last few days <malay>alih-alih macam</malay>
their reporting
(err) people who are un-subscribing from Netflix are at an all time high
[ah] or
yes cause of the cuties it's cause (err) (err)
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and <malay>apa</malay> okay [ah] to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing [ah] and <malay>kau kau tahu</malay> the controversy behind it
okay
alright so on on the surface level [eh] on the surface level is like [ah]
this de-sexualisation of minors [kan] <malay>selalunya</malay> I would say [kan] <malay>syaiton</malay> slowly <malay>syaiton</malay> is slowly inserting his influence on these things [ah]
desensitising us to sexualisation so
but (err) you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> they are just
ten eleven years old [kan]
eleven years old not wearing [ah] so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
it's my niece [ah] ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world [tau] <malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] the fact that
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids [ah] and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences [eh]
and then you have the goal of the director <malay>nama dia macam</malay> sounds a muslim #maimunah# the cold or something <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] one of the subject people from france <malay>punya</malay> territories [ah]
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal <malay>ini</malay> [kan] but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like [oh] it's a coming of
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing [lah] that's the justification [ah] so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world [ah] mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of people
<malay>aku nak tahu ni</malay> who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through <malay>budak-budak sebelas tahun macam</malay>
it's not a sleazy casting call [ah]
(mm) (mm)
kevin spacey serious
he's he plays like nerdy character <malay>macam</malay> he himself looks like
cut off like that [ah] controversial
better for him to keep his mouth shut rather than act moral

he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself [ah] [ah] to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am [kan] (uh) we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong <malay>tapi</malay> is
morally ambiguous [ah] but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging [tau] when you put yourself in and ask yourself
<malay>aku rasa</malay> three [ah] three three to four [ah] then (um)
then you see how brothers three each other and everything [ah] so <malay>kau dah tengok dia punya abang</malay> treat <malay>dia macam mana</malay>

okay <malay>pasal aku aku</malay>
what iPhone is that doesn't look different from previous iPhone
okay
okay
safe entry
camera [ah]
no no no how I do my safe entry basically <malay>kalau</malay> let's say somewhere which I go often [eh] #tampines# mall
I scan one
I keep the browser open
I don't close I don't ever close that browser so the next time I come [ah] use that same old from maybe last week or something <malay>aku malas</malay> [sia] <malay>nak</malay> scan scan <malay>balik</malay> ya ya I breaking protocols here but ya that's how I do it
(mmhmm)
A level O level <malay>semua keluar</malay> [a'ah] okay
(mmhmm)
really
okay
(mmhmm)
which is which yours
okay [ah] so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
but <malay>apa</malay> double tap <malay>terus masuk</malay> camera mode <malay>apa</malay>
code <malay>keluar</malay> the camera app [ah]
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
<malay>aku</malay> press camera app I point it at the code
[a'ah] so why double tap can just <malay>masuk</malay> the app then
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] I was thinking <malay>apa macam</malay> [sial] [ah] <malay>aku tengok</malay> is that a code <malay>jadi</malay> code to your address or
ya
so what's the <malay>ayat</malay>
so the start of the <malay>ayat</malay> start at the bottom
[oh] you go it goes in a clockwise
[ah]
(mm)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so where is
(oo)
ya ya ya ya ya ya
I I see what you did that you got <malay>ayatul kursi</malay> on
as long as
give me a good few suggestions [eh] [ah] my dad told me there's this good place <malay>dekat</malay> somewhere near the mushroom park opposite mushroom park
[a'ah]
[ah] it's not at mushroom park [tau] mushroom park is old #chang kee# <malay>punya</malay> run is it's a cafe run by old #chang kee# but it's apparently across (err)
I know it's across mushroom park <malay>atau</malay> across the stadium
anchorvale <malay>nya</malay>
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
[a'ah] it's cheap but you can't get anymore <malay>melayu</malay> then that [ah] [eh]
why
one corner
wait
wait so it it's not a good name cause there's no place to <malay>lepak</malay> or it's not a good name cause there's no corner for you to <malay>lepak</malay>
it's like the conundrum you how do you confused a <malay>mat</malay> you ask him you know put in a round room and ask me to <malay>lepak</malay> one corner
[oh] hawker centre
[a'ah] [a'ah] correct
(mmhmm)
so it's not the
[a'ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>kat mana</malay>
[oh] the cross across the <malay>simpang ini</malay> [kan] ya correct correct correct

right
can
[oh] okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
(err) this kind of thing you have to <malay>macam mak bapa</malay> [ah] then sometimes they will advise <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam orang tua</malay> they have their preferred (um) preferred <malay>kadi</malay> of choice <malay>macam</malay> they <malay>dorang</malay> have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi</malay> [ah] <malay>lembut cara dia berbual</malay> that kind of thing [lah] so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding (err) you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
your wedding date will be available then (um) you can
choose
[eh] I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically (err) when you
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you (err) <malay>boleh</malay> book [ah] then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of <malay>kadi</malay> available then all the <malay>kadi</malay> then they also show like where the <malay>kadi</malay> lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them [lah] basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>takut kadi</malay> (err) they wanted for morning morning wedding [kan] so <malay>dorangnya</malay> ceremony for the <malay>nikah pagi</malay> so <malay>dorang tak nak macam kadi takut</malay> jam so <malay>kalau katakan</malay> they wanted to have a eight
(um) ceremony [kan] then after that [oh] nine ceremony then <malay>katakan</malay> they scared [oh] if the <malay>kadi tinggal</malay> #pasir ris# then my ceremony is in #jurong# <malay>dorang takut kadi datang</malay> jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred (err) they don't have a preferred (err) <malay>kadi</malay> sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby [ah] so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the <malay>kadi punya tak</malay>
what's that called where he lives is also (err) stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just (um)
look at the <malay>kadi</malay> available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of <malay>kadi</malay> available you just choose [ah] say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the <malay>kadi</malay> who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this [one] you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that <malay>dah</malay> then you can <malay>boleh masuk</malay> and book the once your date is available you can go and book [lah]
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance [lah] ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
[oh] then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is [ah] amendment there is [ah] basically (um) when you choose (err) your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things [ah]
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the <malay>kadi</malay> available
and then after that <malay>macam</malay>
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to #lina# everything [kan] send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire (um) all the details so that (err) being a typical singaporean [ah] we #kiasu# [one] so (err) once (err) once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the <malay>kadi</malay> that I want but eventually on that day itself my <malay>kadi</malay> was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
(err) for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I (err) you can ask #lina# for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit <malay>macam tak sabar</malay> everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it <malay>kadi kadi</malay> I think there's only three or four
then everything else is <malay>naib kadi</malay> ya
ya is it ten is it [oh] okay
<malay>ni wali punya</malay> thing
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller [lah] basically
I don't think anybody does any <malay>kadi</malay> reviews last time of course [lah] ya
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay [ah]
(mmhmm) ya you don't want to you don't want to <malay>macam yang</malay> draggy draggy until <malay>macam kasi</malay> trauma that kind of thing [kan]
(mm) sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> the <malay>orang yang datang tak semua</malay> islam
you know [kan] that's that's one thing that for me also cause <malay>macam</malay> my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended (err) <malay>nikah</malay> ceremony with all the <malay>dua</malay> and everything with all the <malay>ceramah</malay> everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them [lah]
that's one thing also but
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good <malay>kadi</malay> but then sometimes you don't want someone who
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that [lah] but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
I think I think the okay when it comes to <malay>kadi</malay> they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
cause okay
put yourself in their shoes [lah] <malay>macam dorang</malay>
<malay>setiap minggu ada nikah</malay> to do
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like (err) like they're they're very busy [lah] so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
they will message you and then he will they usually the <malay>kadi</malay> will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
so included me and #alina#
why he did that was basically just to <malay>macam ingatkan</malay> (err) remind you to <malay>bawa</malay> your (err) <malay>bawa</malay> then documents that you need to bring [lah] basically and then (um) some time then (err) he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp [lah] he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I (um)
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say [lah] then I say <malay>tak</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>banyak</malay> members <malay>dah kahwin</malay> then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so <malay>macam apa nak cakap</malay> and everything all I got it down [lah]
no need to worry but for some of my friends some <malay>kadi</malay> will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya <malay>ke</malay> but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script [ah] (err) post post <malay>nikah</malay> ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in (err) like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to <malay>baku</malay> ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school <malay>macam kau</malay> primary school your oral have to be <malay>baku</malay> [kan] ya exactly
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different [lah]
okay so the initial the initial <malay>kadi</malay> that we chose (um) on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague [lah] basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before [lah] basically ya ya the <malay>kadi</malay> before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya (um) but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the <malay>kadi</malay> that you want and then set a date with
then <malay>turun</malay> [ah] <malay>turun</malay> (err) on whichever date that (err) you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the <malay>kadi</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] (err) <malay>tunang saya bapa bukan</malay> islam then <malay>dia tanya</malay> like things of like how what is what's (err) (um) [lah] what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit [lah] basically ya
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday [ah] you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you [oh] close the window
ya things like that [lah] but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
I wanted to get the <malay>kadi</malay> that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one <malay>kadi</malay> that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that <malay>macam</malay>
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so <malay>macam</malay> on the day itself if you need to do then [oh] <malay>semua dah siap</malay>
(um)
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot [lah] ya but for me it was I chose the [eh] no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
(um) I would say a lot of people <malay>nikah</malay> on saturday
a lot of people actually <malay>nikah</malay> on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate (err) double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married <malay>nikah</malay> on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
(um) ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different [ah] (mm) different [ah]
!wah! I don't remember whether there's any charges [eh]
<malay>tak ingat</malay>
okay okay
don't need [one] not necessary [ah] they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
<malay>nak kena faham</malay> I mean from their point of view is necessary [lah] for people to for couples to be <malay>macam</malay> (err) ready I mean all these is like (err) basic <malay>rumahtangga punya</malay> knowledge [ah] right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
like what is (um) it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
(um) civics you know like to for you to understand like [oh] if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing [lah] ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of <malay>macam</malay> very open conversations [lah] but I find it a waste of time for me personally
ya so I told them (err) I I've got work [lah] they will they will still will pressure you then [oh] but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
is not with the is not you don't interview with your <malay>kadi</malay> ya you do with with (err) the the head <malay>kadi</malay> who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
ya so then you have
and the <malay>wakil</malay> from the bride
as in not not necessarily <malay>wakil</malay> [lah] as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought <malay>mak</malay> [ah]
you can ask the mother
I mean like it will be better [lah] right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought <malay>mak</malay> so ya
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya (err) then he <malay>banyak soalan juga</malay> they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
ya
you don't really you don't have a conversation with <malay>kadi</malay> until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the <malay>kadi</malay>
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything [kan] submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of (err) the the <malay>ustaz</malay> is there [lah] he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things [lah] I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and <malay>lepas tu</malay>
I think he asked <malay>mak</malay> some questions then ask #lina# some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two <malay>kakak</malay> there will be asking you <malay>macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada</malay> marriage prep <malay>ni</malay> [eh] (err) <malay>apa</malay> for you to go and then you like [oh] and !alamak! <malay>ni saya bila</malay> [lah] then for me right what happened to me was like <malay>dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh</malay> sign up <malay>ni bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> very informative and everything [lah] they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy [ah] so then after that then they will shut up
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say <malay>aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi</malay> [ah] that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all <malay>macam</malay> a propaganda kind of thing like <malay>semua kena pergi</malay> you know like kind of thing <malay>kena pergi</malay> like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word <malay>kena</malay> you know is like <malay>kau kena pergi</malay>
[ah] you know like like cause like typical (err) like <malay>pasar melayu</malay> they will like say [eh] <malay>kau kena pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>ni</malay>
but that word everybody thinks that [oh] it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word <malay>kena</malay> anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of (err) islamic laws [what] for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told #alina# <malay>macam</malay> I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage [lah] I mean to cut down all the cost [lah] basically like I was telling things things like like <malay>dulang</malay> it's not compulsory you know things like that then (um) a lot of the other things [lah] like red wedding cake [lah] the <malay>kompang</malay> [lah] all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end [what] ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch [oh] now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>semua orang duduk</malay> [kan] and <malay>semua orang boleh tengok macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tengah potong</malay> cake (err)
you know but if you have a typical wedding <malay>macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan</malay> buffet [kan] <malay>dorang jalan ambil makan</malay> everything [kan] a lot of the times my friend <malay>potong</malay> cake <malay>orang kat belakang tak tahu</malay> then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple [lah] some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say [oh] I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>aku faham</malay> but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know <malay>macam</malay> if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point [kan]
(mm) dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say (err) like
it it defeat to me [lah] it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it [lah] like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
ya cause they know I I am <malay>degil</malay> usually [lah] when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the <malay>dia punya mak andam suka</malay> control
<malay>mak andam</malay> is the the the the bride's (err) makeup artist [lah] ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different [leh] like #lina# makeup artist makeup <malay>jalan mak andam</malay> is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife (err) one of them <malay>pakai</malay> scarf so the whole day the <malay>mak andam</malay> there <malay>betulkan</malay> scarf <malay>dia</malay> then the other one (err) what's that called makeup then everything <malay>betulkan</malay> makeup <malay>dia</malay> everything [kan] so
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
so then the groom's side don't have <malay>pak andam</malay> (err) I don't know I think it's called <malay>pak andam</malay> ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so (um) the the girl the they they rent the <malay>baju</malay> [kan] they rent the <malay>baju</malay> then they would they <malay>kain samping</malay> they ask <malay>pak andam</malay> it's all part of money making process [lah]
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends [lah] ya so
(err) a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same <malay>mak andam</malay>
cause people you know like [oh] <malay>ni mak andam aku bagus</malay> [tau] you know your makeup <malay>dia baik</malay> then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends [one] then always the same <malay>mak andam</malay> cause they will try to <malay>macam</malay>
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that <malay>macam aku aku</malay> need <malay>satu jam nak tukar</malay> outfit <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar</malay> makeup <malay>dia tukar baju dia</malay> one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so <malay>katakan</malay> all weddings [eh]
all weddings there will be time time time delay
ya whole day so we so basically <malay>katakan lepas nikah</malay> you plan in your itinerary <malay>habis nikah pukul lapan setengah</malay> (err) let's say <malay>sebelas setengah</malay> your <malay>habis nikah sebelas setengah</malay> right but then you think is <malay>sebelas setengah habis</malay> (err) <malay>pukul dua belas tukar baju</malay> for the next half I can bet with you <malay>sebelas setengah nikah belum habis</malay>
ceremony <malay>nikah</malay> might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone <malay>macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar</malay> [eh] <malay>dah pukul dua belas</malay>
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with <malay>orang nak ambil gambar</malay> every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing <malay>macam semua semua tak pernah</malay> I went to any wedding where is <malay>macam</malay> on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you <malay>macam</malay> [oh] eleven O five you come here like no point [lah] you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad [lah] you don't you don't <malay>macam</malay> because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five <malay>kita turun bawah</malay> eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
really
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know <malay>mak andam suka macam</malay> they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to <malay>selit</malay> as much time as possible so for example
for me [ah] I scold my friends <malay>mak andam</malay> a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing [ah] cause basically like say for my friend right
<malay>dia nikah kat masjid</malay> then <malay>lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar</malay>
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did <malay>kat</malay> #simei# <malay>yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang</malay> to move off they want to move off then after that (err) I'm supposed to move off at (err) twelve o'clock so
ceremony there will start at one thirty
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen [eh] no no now is eleven (err) at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty <malay>ke</malay> eleven forty five around there
then she's like I think we should move off now
[kan] then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing [lah] cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding [eh] eleven thirty she said we should move off now
then after that she went (err) she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the <malay>nikah kat masjid</malay> is the groom's side
the <malay>makan</malay> at #simei# is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum <malay>kita nak kena jalan sekarang</malay> [tau] then the groom's mum (err) <malay>tapi pengantin belum makan</malay> [tau]
<malay>belum makan</malay> [eh] <malay>lepas nikah</malay> everything <malay>ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan</malay> then she said (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga</malay> [pe]
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location [what] how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no <malay>kita pengantin makan</malay> then I told my friends to go and <malay>siapkan</malay> the food
she went behind my back again she tell the <malay>mak</malay> the <malay>mak</malay> (err) <malay>pengantin</malay> both sides [eh] (err) <malay>tak payah makan</malay> [eh] <malay>kita makan kat sana</malay> [jer] [eh] she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like (err) (err) <malay>tak tahu awak tanya salam</malay> that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how <malay>degil</malay> and how angry I can get (err) so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the <malay>mak andam</malay> cannot say anything [lah] she cause she want to turn back (err) she know what I'm gonna say already
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully [lah] it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom [ah] right [ah] exactly <malay>kita dah</malay> plan <malay>dorang makan apa</malay> you want to tell them <malay>makan makan ala kadar</malay> okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the <malay>pengantin</malay> table then she sitting down there
<malay>tak payah tak payah tak payah</malay> like I no [lah] <malay>awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan</malay> ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay [lah] okay [lah] you know
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live (err) a #chendol# station [ah] everything like in the mosque everything [lah] quite quite nice [lah] he paid for everything
then ya [lor] then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is (um) itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty <malay>dorang belum</malay> start <malay>makan</malay> [tau] that in her mind by the time <malay>dorang</malay> start <malay>makan</malay> by the time <malay>dah gini gini aku tak ada</malay> time <malay>nak betulkan rambut si dia ni</malay> that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
<malay>jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau</malay> you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
for me [lah] is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible [lah] in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible [lah] you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the <malay>macam</malay> for me [lah] as the as the the brides (err) [eh] as the best best man I have to <malay>macam</malay> keep everything running [lah] ya
yes transportation is is the problem to me [ah] that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
ya so those those are the things that for me <malay>macam</malay> important [lah] <malay>nak kena tahu macam</malay>
how no no no no yes they their [eh] they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way [lah] you know that they want to save your money and
different person different [lor] ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing [ah] they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be (err) end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he <malay>gi makan</malay> #prata# and everything I told him to go eat #prata# [what] [ah] cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like (err) <malay>suka hati dia nak makan</malay> [lah] he was <malay>kat sini ada makan apa</malay> [eh] you are like <malay>kau tanya aku kat</malay> fort canning <malay>mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai</malay> #prata#
(err) I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at #bedok# reservoir
ya
ya
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you have to also <malay>macam</malay> recce how much are they charging you for rental [lah] because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own <malay>baju</malay>
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to #dewi#
like for me I leave it to #alina# like for me I leave it to #alina# on how you want to to but the thing is like #alina# also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research [mah]
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her <malay>mak andam</malay> makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her <malay>macam</malay> that is all on you
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like [eh] I cannot be splitting it right down the middle [ah] right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like [eh] our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like [eh] I want fifty dollar my problem [lah]
I pay myself [what] that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
it's not a <malay>macam</malay> a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that [one] if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you <malay>macam</malay> maybe some makeup artists [oh] this is hundred dollars that [one] is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have (err) chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that [lah] ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
(mm) salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
(um)
(mm)
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are <malay>sekali</malay> they make you look like a #nyonya# you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
(mm) ya but but like I say these kind of thing <malay>suruh</malay> #dewi# <malay>pergi</malay> Instagram go and stalk people [lah]
[ah] you can just search makeup artist or <malay>mak andam</malay> then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check [oh] !wah! her makeup very nice [ah] look very natural and you go see [oh] it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask #dewi# to message her #alina# I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram (err) for for quotations
(mm)
ya not necessary <malay>mak andam</malay> would be worth it if you are planning to rent <malay>baju</malay> I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they <malay>macam</malay> [oh] because it's (err) package <malay>dengan empat baju</malay> cause it's (err) bride and groom <malay>tukar dua kali</malay> you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of <malay>baju</malay>
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the <malay>baju kurung</malay> you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own (err) western <malay>baju</malay> for example [kan] then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this <malay>mak andam</malay> then she will give you discounts [ah] that kind of thing [lah] ya they all have like their full package
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding (err) expo and everything [kan] so it's a bit different [ah]
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why <malay>macam</malay> your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to <malay>tukar baju</malay> from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography [ah] ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing [lah] ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
(mmhmm) can do that also
(err) I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place [lah] if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled [lah] I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
(mm) can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us [lah]
ya it is quite nice also over there (um) on the wedding day itself [lah] ya
as in your wedding day [lah] I want to book the indigo room over there [oh] no need [lah] ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points [oh] no need [lah] no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel (mm) no need no need no need
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and <malay>mak</malay> then that's it [lah] for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves [lah]
(um)
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well [lah] I would say (err) okay so basically
you have to see
(mm) yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and #alina# did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
!wah! she the that that that girl is amazing [ah] ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
just to put at the front so when during <malay>kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah</malay>
<malay>orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk</malay> they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after <malay>orang makan</malay> they can go to the park
but
at the same time you cannot expect people <malay>dah makan jalan</malay> [ah] is okay you also cannot expect <malay>dah makan jalan</malay> [lah] you know that kind of thing [ah] [eh] <malay>kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan</malay> [lah] you cannot do that [what] right
ya it's all it's all my cousins [lor] all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early [kan] ya
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also [oh] might as well <malay>aku dah datang pukul sebelas</malay> might as well <malay>aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah</malay> you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the <malay>nikah</malay> all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like !wah! I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues [lah] basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about (err) the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important [lah]
we didn't walk in
ya <malay>nikah</malay> it started off with <malay>nikah</malay> #alina# seated #alina# seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no <malay>kompang</malay> or nothing [what]
(mm) ya <malay>dah habis ambil gambar kita makan</malay> ya
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
<malay>janji melayu mana ada mana</malay>
ya
the <malay>kalau tak nak</malay> stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible [lah] but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was <malay>nikah</malay>
<malay>makan jalan</malay>
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like <malay>kau nak ambil gambar ni tak</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>sembarang</malay>
<malay>boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang</malay> [ah] like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be <malay>macam</malay> that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you <malay>macam</malay> he eleven [oh] eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten <malay>nak kena ke bawah</malay> eleven fifteen you <malay>kita jalan</malay> then like
I was like
<malay>takkan jadi</malay> during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take <malay>macam</malay> you have to tell the makeup [oh] you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time [lah] from <malay>mak andam</malay> we get I get that and everything but the same time <malay>macam</malay> as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time [mah] you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on [oh] this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know <malay>dua belas tak boleh</malay> [ah] but anything before that you want to change anything <malay>kira</malay> for me is like now you can be flexible
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
and you must also understand <malay>macam lepas dah nikah</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti ada orang ambil gambar</malay>
then <malay>nak salam</malay> that kind of thing [kan] and <malay>nak orang turun</malay>
<malay>dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok</malay> the tea ceremony
things like that [lah]
okay
(mmhmm) I would say you don't need to worry about the activity [ah] people will just take picture with you [lah]
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing [eh] no one no one cares [lah]
my the recent one with my with my (err) sister in law's brother we did at (err) malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
I mean that is considering is still during this period [ah] I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
ya no problem [lah]
<malay>tak</malay> no problem [ah] no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem [lah]
no need [lah] okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know [oh] but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me [ah] especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now [tau] <malay>macam yang datang</malay> members members <malay>kau sendiri</malay> then <malay>macam kalau nak ada bayar</malay> I mean you
no but the two weddings I been to also
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just (err) okay (err) <malay>dia</malay> they just [ah] okay [ah] <malay>keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar</malay> that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come <malay>gitu gitu</malay> just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always <malay>macam</malay> felt that
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's !wah! you got a lot money
to me [lah] personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like [eh] <malay>kau buat apa</malay> I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee [lah] I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me [lah] personally
you know the emcee who likes to takeover <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay <malay>sekarang</malay> groom <malay>awak jumpa dia macam mana</malay> you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements [what]
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
ya I don't find it necessary [lah] I mean unless you what you will have a <malay>macam</malay>
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different [lah] but <malay>tak tak macam buang duit</malay> [ah]
yes
yup we we make our own [lah] (um) cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early [lah] cause it's it's not fast job [mah]
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like !wow!
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
(err) my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
(mm) but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know [one] when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their <malay>mak andam</malay> and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very #kiasu# game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like #alina# throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be [what] then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes [ah] and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks [lah] the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important [lor]
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right (um)
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua orang</malay> pose <malay>macam gini</malay> then <malay>kau</malay> pose <malay>macam gini</malay> that kind of thing you want someone who's like <malay>aku ada</malay> idea <malay>aku</malay> last weekend <malay>aku buat macam gini</malay> [tau] <malay>kau nak buat macam gini</malay> you know that kind of thing then like [eh] <malay>kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang</malay> in thing in thing <malay>orang semua ambil gambar macam gini</malay>
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side [oh] <malay>macam</malay> okay okay okay <malay>ambil gambar</malay> okay okay <malay>kiri kiri sikit</malay> okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff [lah] I would say but I like him because (err) he listens to what I say
ya cause okay like (um) after the <malay>nikah</malay> I told #alina# I don't want to take pictures first <malay>lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu</malay> so parents come up here we <malay>salam</malay> then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties (err) came up first and then (err) they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of #alina# and then after that our photographer <malay>macam</malay> ya is ya we I understand all this [ah] they they get super excited <malay>ambil gambar dulu cepat</malay> before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say <malay>cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan</malay> #lina# <malay>dulu</malay>
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought <malay>jom ambil gambar</malay>
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be <malay>macam</malay> okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me (err) <malay>salam</malay> parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps [lah]
[ah] then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional [lah] he listens to me [lah] ya
<malay>tak ada</malay>
yup ya so I just walk around [ah] I told him to follow me ya no [lah] I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked #lina# to go inside then she like

postpone it
[oh]
talking about it I don't whether can say it here but anyways
I mean I don't know but ya okay but never mind I just say [lah] I think it doesn't go anywhere but what's this
you were from griffiths right
then you should know
#amalina#
she was from griffiths primary
your age
<malay>perempuan ada</malay> #amalina# <malay>perempuan</malay>
[eh] <malay>ada</malay> #amalina# <malay>lelaki</malay>
why would a guy be named #amalina#
I don't know whether you will remember cause ya it's primary school so I'm not so sure
(mm)
ya so you don't remember [lah]
ya
ya so anyways ya the cousin
my cousin got married to this #amalina# [lah] ya
yes
ya
ya but after that she went to (err) #ngee ann# secondary [ah]
and then (uh)
[oh] no no no because that time like [ah] the <malay>minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin</malay> I I just went to their new house [ah]
ya <malay>dia jemput</malay> then just <malay>duduk berbual-bual</malay> then he was saying about (err) I think we're just asking like the school [lah] ya then I said [oh] I'm from #zhong zheng# then say [oh] #zhong zheng# I I wanted I wanted that actually she said [ah] ya but (uh) <malay>akak apa</malay> (err) <malay>macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang</malay> then <malay>mak dia cakap takpe takpe</malay> apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know suddenly it dawned on me just now like [eh] <malay>macam</malay> that I know if I'm not wrong <malay>kau pula</malay> as in <malay>kau apa</malay> your primary school was in griffiths so ya
(mm) ya
[eh] is it still existent <malay>dah tak</malay> right
[oh] #angsana# yes
ya
#zhong zheng# or
why [ah]
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you grade [lah]
no cause last time [kan] I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really <malay>macam</malay> #kanchiong# <malay>macam</malay> want to push the children
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
!huh!
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays [ah]
#kiasu#
(mm)
[oh] no <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>asal dia masuk</malay> #angsana# <malay>pula</malay> [eh]
what is the <malay>tempat baru</malay>
<malay>dua</malay>
<malay>rumah abang kau kat mana</malay>
[orh] [eh] (mm) green ridges #tampines# green <malay>banyak</malay> [ah] #tampines# green <malay>banyak sangat</malay>
[orh]
[orh]
as in <malay>dekat blok kau</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay>
for for one year [ah]
one year
(mm)
how much is school bus [eh]
(hmm)
ya
(mm)
no like <malay>takut apa</malay>
<malay>termati ke apa</malay> <malay>dia macam</malay> wasted all the recording
(hmm)
I think should be fine
I don't know [lah] should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
[ah]
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
[oh] yes I forgot that I got one good news today
(um) ya my <malay>budak nakal dia</malay> withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything [lah] is because like the grandpa <malay>macam</malay> is sick or something like [oh] having surgery and then (um) it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes [ah]
so the kid I mean [ah] over for <malay>macam</malay> child care centre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months [ah] and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
ya he's present he's rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start <malay>macam</malay> you know february
ya he's going to another school he <malay>dia</malay> [kan] very smart [kan] so <malay>dia berbual-bual</malay> [lah] <malay>tadi</malay> [jer] (uh) <malay>apa sebelum</malay> my shi</mandarin> come for work <malay>dia dah bilang ni dah</malay> [oh] [ah] you're going to a new school (um) ya it's called little school house (uh) it's at #tampines# #tampines# station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] like nonstop
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the ya is him
ya not exactly okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe (uh) <malay>macam dah tengok macam gini</malay> [kan] maybe I could just stay for like
one one more year and then ya I'll leave [lah]
ya see how it goes
ya
I told you right my my colleague <malay>apa mengandung</malay> I think <malay>dah tujuh bulan</malay> [eh] <malay>nampak perut besar gila</malay> then <malay>kena</malay> handle <malay>budak kecil</malay> [tau]
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>penat</malay> [ah] <malay>penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni</malay> pregnant <malay>macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> [kan] of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay [ah] but if you handle younger kids <malay>susah</malay> [seh]
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids [lah] also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say (um)
<malay>kalau</malay> younger kids yes definitely <malay>pasal aku cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> bend <malay>asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik</malay> ya it's very <malay>sakit</malay> [ah] <malay>belakang</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>tak kalau macam</malay> (um) <malay>budak kecil</malay> like play group like <malay>kau kena cebokkan</malay> nak <malay>tukar</malay> diaper <malay>semua</malay> ya you're constantly using your back [leh] [ah]
ya <malay>kita orang macam gini</malay> okay [lah] <malay>habis kalau kau</malay> pregnant <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh]
older kids [ah] I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers (err)
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
(mm)
[orh]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
approval [lah]
so who decides
the deployment
okay
actually what do head of departments do last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering <malay>apa</malay> <malay>punya orang buat</malay> [seh] like they like always always in the office like you see
you see the teachers but you don't see the
people like rarely right
[oh] so they do teach
!wah!
consider own free time <malay>lepak minum teh</malay> <malay>minum teh kat</malay> [lah] canteen
busy [ah]
[orh] [eh] then usually consider <malay>gaji besar</malay> [eh] <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
like
[oh] <malay>banyak</malay> five K
<malay>takpe biarkan dorang tahu</malay>
(mm)
trust me I think you told me before ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
it's set auto [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
you say it's (uh)
<malay>tanah besar</malay> [kan] is it
ya
ya
ya
[ah] <malay>tak potong</malay>
[a'ah] [sia] <malay>dorang gaji tak potong</malay>
<malay>apa gaji tak potong</malay> !wah! #shiok# [seh] <malay>bawa balik</malay>
(oo)
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya earn five K because <malay>macam</malay> childcare <malay>punya</malay> principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's (um)
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
(uh)
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing [lah] just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then (err) depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is (err) cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya [lah] I mean basically you can climb [lah]
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
climb <malay>cuma cuma aku</malay> [jer] <malay>yang tak nak panjat</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> stay [jer]
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered <malay>cincai punya</malay> ya <malay>macam kesah tak kesah</malay> [jer]
ya like my
but by right <malay>macam</malay> ya seriously like
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone [ah]
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
<malay>tak nak</malay>
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya
ya I mean I mean <malay>kita orang dah belajar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam macam tak perlu</malay> I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
<malay>tak kejar tak mengejar impian tapi macam</malay>
how to say (um)
I don't know what I'm saying
yes yes yes ya
ya exactly ya
it's not like (um) the <malay>malas</malay> concept or something but it's just the
ya
contented yes that's the right word ya
ya
<malay>bagus sangat bagus</malay>
ya
(mm)
I mean every career <malay>pun mesti ada macam dia punya</malay> progression [ah] ya but
ya I don't know
<malay>daripada</malay> travel <malay>pergi ke sini</malay>

okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>

but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes

!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)

you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies

that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know

<malay>jap</malay> [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>
just <malay>teka</malay> [lah]

study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right

the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary

I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]
yes
[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]
if <malay>ikat</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam kelakar</malay> [eh] <malay>takde</malay> <malay>kat dalam bilik ni</malay> [eh]
[ah] [sia] <malay>besar</malay> [seh]
I mean <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> later
we can go later we can go tomorrow
!wah! [eh] the counter <malay>tak cantik</malay> [ah]
yup
no [lah] <malay>kita kena kena kena letak dulu</malay> [pe] [oh] <malay>takleh</malay> [eh]
okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>
<malay>adalah satay</malay>
<malay>satay lembu</malay>
<malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketupat sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi kuah satay banyak-banyak banyak letak banyak bawang banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>banyak bawang</malay> and <malay>banyak timun</malay>
(uh)
ya <malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
I can eat that I think for every single meal
<malay>pilihan kedua</malay>
<malay>seperti anda</malay>
<malay>adalah nasi sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng adalah hidangan</malay>
<malay>yang lengkap</malay>
<malay>dia manis dia pedas ada masin</malay>
you know
<malay>dia lengkap</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng</malay> is what I would call a perfect meal
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay

!wah!

staycation how
serious are you serious
[ah] seven hundred
that's like
no
but what options like [kan] that time <malay>kita tengok</malay> a few then after that is like
limited pax
[ah] smaller rooms
[ah]
but #karim# is big
at
[ah]
okay (um) I think
still <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>dalam</malay> (err) a hundred plus ya below two hundred should be okay like I think <malay>kita</malay> total <malay>ada empat orang</malay> [jer]
(mm)
should be [lah] anyway <malay>pun</malay> is
[oh] but don't know how strict the hotel is
yup
[oh]
it's <malay>dekat mana</malay>
#tanjong pagar# <malay>boleh buat apa</malay> [sia] #tanjong pagar# <malay>ada apa</malay>
[a'ah] #tanjong pagar#
#tanjong pagar# and #tiong bahru# is
<malay>lain</malay> [kan] I always get them mixed up I always get them mixed up I'm just saying yes
<malay>yang</malay> [ah] [oh] that one is <malay>yang</malay> #tiong bahru# market [kan]
ya [lah] of course [dah]
[dah] I think it's like [dah] eight december coming
yes
yes definitely
ya but I think more or less is confirm [lah] cause <malay>karim punya</malay> date <malay>pun macam</malay>
all set already like he's either looking at twenty or twenty nine I anytime can you also anytime can
!huh!
okay [lah] it's just <malay>satu hari</malay> [jer] <malay>apa</malay> right monday
[orh]
I thought
okay see how [lah] [hor]
anyway can there be a <malay>macam</malay>
theme for the
why not cause like every time <malay>kita selalu buat</malay> like this kind of theme <malay>apa</malay>
yes ya because that one was <malay>dekat yang halia</malay> so
it's more apt
#tanjong pagar# theme <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>orang pakai</malay> good morning towels [lah]
[kan] I thought that time <malay>yang kita pergi makan</malay> then I was asking #karim# to decide on the matter
to choose for the
gift exchange
I don't know I don't know <malay>dia dah</malay> decide <malay>ke belum</malay> but I think that time <malay>dia ada cakap</malay> R
so it's like okay
I think it was R
(err)
prime [ah] prime
<malay>kat</malay> #sembawang# <malay>ada</malay> too bad <malay>kat</malay> #sembawang# <malay>ada</malay>
okay [lah] maybe not prime [lah] okay then
#sheng siong# [lah]
how hard can it be
considerably near
ya we did giant already
[eh] we did giant <malay>ke</malay> [eh]
[ah]
by the way <malay>kipas tu mana</malay>

ya they
<malay>kat</malay> #kopitiam# [jer]
<malay>nak kena</malay> #lohei# [eh]
okay <malay>kita cari</malay> father christmas
okay so
I will plan dinner should there be a budget
like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> carousel
still got buffet or not [ah] anyway
[oh]
that's very <malay>menyemak kalau aku jadi</malay> server <malay>tu aku bingit</malay>
<malay>sibuk aku nak buat kerja sibuk kau nak</malay> order
(hmm)
[ah] ya
okay [lah] I think buffet town quite affordable right
[oh] but
that time #karim# got say something about
he wanted to go there but <malay>dia kena</malay> cancel or something you know no like the location <malay>kena</malay> change or something
no
as in
I think he got some meeting right and then after that and then change location or is that have different buffet town
[ah] okay [lah] so I think assuming that we had never eat there before also [lah] !huh!
have you joined us
sad [leh]
coleslaw
jonas very vegan <malay>makan</malay>
no amos and jonas said okay ya ya
then I think
you all also should be okay [what] [kan] terrence #vilan# edward
[eh] but
but then if
the number of pax per table
!aiya!
I don't know
no
okay I can't comment on that
so means it's still five right
so
I thought we can book but <malay>tak boleh</malay> mingle
[oh]
[oh]
okay
so do what should go for five people
first two first two last one
<malay>tapi yang</malay> last one <malay>makan seorang</malay>
how [ah]
(uh huh)
then I mean like like that one is not like small get together [lah]
<malay>ni kat luar</malay>
it's quite filling
okay
okay unless we just keep it to five [lor] like
ya
ya
okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> homecoming [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
reunion school reunion
when
[ah] what was that one day
ya the
fortune cookie
ya
okay [lah] I think
should be okay with five of us right
I mean <malay>tak payah</malay> jonas <malay>pun susah</malay> [kan] <malay>nak makan</malay>
vegan
okay can
wait when when is the dinner
[oh]
[oh] [oh] ya
(mm)
okay [lor]
then like that
we can dinner on twenty eight or twenty nine
at buffet town
<malay>nanti</malay> edward complain <malay>lagi cakap</malay> should have change [lah] should have change [lah]
hopefully
could be
okay
so means that is settled then it's just the hotel [jer] but date is settled [lah] and I think <malay>makan pun</malay> is
[eh] but you said at west
[oh]
we going two days one night [ah]
[oh]
wait twenty eight is (err)
monday sunday sunday [lah] I think it's sunday [lah] sunday monday cause every setup he got one weekend he needs to clear
ya
no I think it's sunday monday
[eh] maybe monday tuesday
[oh] rates
then he say it's like seven hundred online
the I was only four hundred
but how come it's just that date difference [ah]
[oh]
lame
speaking of travel
of course [lah] I mean it's so nice the weather is cold
<malay>kat sini pun dekat</malay> [kan]
hotel <malay>punya</malay> room [jer] [lah]
no
okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer !hais! that was
global warming
too bad
okay [lah] but at least you went out so still okay
okay [lah]
then like that
(hmm) more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
[oh] ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that (um) what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
(mm)
!huh!
<malay>tak cukup ke</malay>
I thought they are going to prioritise <malay>yang</malay> the elderly or like
[ah]
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay [lah] probably
it's gonna be better
!huh! but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young [lah]
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest [lah] is like
don't know <malay>kalau dekat sana</malay> like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
[ah] I was looking at this youtube (um)
the youtube is from america [lah]
then like it's (err) <malay>pasal</malay> plants
yes
so it's like (um)
she
went to a nursery with
<malay>dia punya mak</malay>
like plant nursery with <malay>dia punya mak</malay>
then (um) the funny thing was <malay>dia seorang</malay> [jer] <malay>yang pakai</malay> mask
<malay>mak dia tak pakai</malay> mask
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear [lah] I don't know [lah] it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
<malay>mak dia tak pakai</malay> mask so it's like !huh!
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
and ya [lah] <malay>dia orang punya rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>selalu</malay> mansion mansion <malay>berapa</malay> storey <malay>semua</malay> [kan] so they can afford the space but it's already like
there's a lot of different plants that (um) she feature [lah]
and then (err) the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
one of it was like a cactus not the tall tall cactus ya <malay>dekat</malay> desert <malay>punya bukan</malay>
no no is not succulent it's like probably <malay>macam</malay> the height
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> the height of the snake plant [ah]
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent [what] no [meh]
no it's like
[ah] it's like a
(um)
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
it's not a fake one it's not a fake one it's not <malay>bukan macam kau punya</malay> this thing
ya it's like (um) apparently when the leaves are young
like
it's quite bendy but then <malay>bila dia dah tua</malay> like it's quite stiff kind
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though [ah]
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
<malay>yang dia beli tu</malay> is quite an old one so it's quite tall
ya it's quite tall
<malay>pokok</malay> mango
yes
(mmhmm)
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
<malay>ada banyak</malay> problem than benefit
cause I think it's like (um) you see
in a
especially like a globalized world right now <malay>macam kalau</malay> you lockdown means there are a lot of things gonna stop
so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of disruptions
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
<malay>bukan</malay> natural way [lah] like like the business way the business way is that <malay>macam kena</malay> halt and and
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think (um)
ya this's why I think that it create a lot of problems because <malay>macam</malay> like
you think about it all the businesses <malay>dia orang punya</malay> momentum is already there like going and stuff like that then when this lockdown issue come then <malay>kena</malay> halt suddenly and you are forced to rethink your own ways of (err) during business [ah] so it's too soon to adapt
(um) and there's no leeway [lah]
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the period but I think
for the personal lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
cause <malay>macam</malay> like if you see about
I mean I don't know about your area [lah] but myself like #ang mo kio# this kind of area my <malay>banyak orang-orang tua</malay> live right then like you see those <malay>apek-apek duduk bawah</malay> block <malay>baca surat khabar</malay> that kind just like just <malay>duduk bawah</malay> block that kind
and you know you're not allowed to go out and you are you're forced to stay at home then is <malay>macam</malay>
it like I think
I don't know but I feel [lah] <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay>
normal way of living <malay>pun kena</malay> change forcefully change so in that sense you especially <malay>bila dia orang dah</malay> like this kind of age
it's not so healthy because
one thing is that <malay>dia orang pun</malay> could probably be living alone and this is their only form of <malay>macam</malay> keeping sane and (err) you know socialise that kind of thing like
in their own way of keeping healthy [lah] so I think in that sense (err) that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
businesses wise I think (um) I think between businesses and societal <malay>macam</malay> thirty seventy
thirty to business ya cause I think <malay>kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you are just #suay# [lah] then you just <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>baru</malay> then <malay>kena</malay> lockdown then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] too bad for you [lah] but businesses wise like you said it can be a
(err) just a method [oh] [oh] a matter of adaptation and how quick you are [lah] but then also <malay>macam</malay> those traditional businesses <malay>pun macam</malay> losing out also because
they are traditional [lah] like <malay>kat kedai kopi ni semua</malay>
<malay>cik limah punya mee rebus</malay>
they actually force them to actually
(mm)
(mm)
okay [lah] I mean on the other hand <malay>pun macam</malay> you need to also see like <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>cik limah punya kedai mee rebus tu</malay>
[ah]
but I think about limitation [leh] <malay>macam</malay> like for example the reason why maybe <malay>cik limah tak pergi</malay> digital is is maybe because <malay>dia punya</malay> (um) expertise is not there then <malay>kalau</malay> she go digital <malay>pun macam siapa nak tolong dia kat kedai</malay> to go digital and the reason why maybe she doesn't want to even be on grabfood is probably because she only have maybe one helper help <malay>dekat</malay> the shop then if if her shop is really booming the business which is good for her but then ya ya [lah] but then like on her side <malay>pun macam</malay> it's difficult for her to handle the volume and then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say she is able to handle the volume then like what about the you know the same card with the riders and stuff like
okay is okay [lah] but I think before
enforcing or like really okay [lah] enforcing <malay>macam</malay> a bit tough [lah] but like (um) pushing people to like this kind of places to go digital
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(err)
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
(mm)
(mm)
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those (um)
underprivileged families where you are staying <malay>macam</malay> like all those rental flats that kind that is a point to also kind of bring up because
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
(um) minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of (err) amenities for them to study which are like the laptop [lah] the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
there was also this <malay>macam</malay> article I think <malay>dekat dekat mana</malay> [eh]
the straits times or something like that <malay>yang</malay> this (um)
girl in
[ah] [ah]
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her [lah] but for like elders other younger kids [leh] then how
ya
(mm)
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
the and all these case [lah] basically <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> wifi <malay>bukannya</malay> strong [kan] like you know you have a lot to handle
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
<malay>aku tengok kat luar tingkap</malay> [jer]
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today [lah] I think there were also reports plus (err) like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
(um)
thought of
like
okay [lah] the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> dorm [kan] ya
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans [what] just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans [what] so it should be
(um)
encompass in all this care [lah]
but I think like
maybe I don't know like <malay>dia orang</malay> should probably lockdown in stages <malay>agaknya</malay> (um)
(mm)
(mm)
I think definitely the biggest loser is like the <malay>orang-orang tua</malay> who are staying in their who are staying on their own that is really the biggest loser because
ya
ya even (um)
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
I mean <malay>orang tua</malay> like they probably don't have
iphone ten
it's probably just a land line <malay>dekat rumah yang</malay> ya ya ya and you can just call to hear your other family members voice but you can't see that
but more physically [lah] so
(err) that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
(mm)
no [lah] I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of [lah] I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
[oh] is it
[oh]
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on [lah]
cause I think <malay>dekat</malay> news <malay>pun ada cakap pasal</malay> the number of domestic abusers
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay [lah] I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
to be honest like I wanted the to kind of go on cause ya it's quite <malay>lepak</malay>
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
!aiyo! but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
!hais!
don't know what's gonna happen and
problem okay what do we talk about <malay>pasal</malay> societal business (err)
(mm)
I think
how can nature be a problem
no ya <malay>bukannya</malay> tracks <malay>semua ada pokok</malay>
that's
but aedes is because of <malay>air bertakung</malay> right
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay [lor] if you say so [lor]
[ah]
unless [lah] got one <malay>pokok pisang dekat</malay> in the middle of the north south line from #yew tee# to #kranji#
then there is a big issue [lah]
but I think like
<malay>ke</malay> wild boar <malay>dekat dekat</malay> #sembawang#
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
<malay>dia orang</malay> enforce the rule people will really follow <malay>apa</malay> it's like you have all those (mm) (mm)
but
ya [lah] but I still think [lah] confirm under black market so it's not that much [lah]
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything [one]
really [what]
(mm)
ya [lah] but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom [what]
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already [what]
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa benda kau bunuh</malay> lion <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that [what] they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no [lah] I think
then animal go home [lor]
take the bus [lor]
no [lah] I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
were these animals obtain [kan] and so <malay>kalau macam</malay> they're like exported from overseas then definitely the home country where is being released
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
<malay>merepek</malay> [ah]
buy one get one free
I think they kill it [leh]
remember there was this report <malay>pasal</malay> mink farm <malay>dekat mana entah</malay>
[ah]
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also [what] and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
that animals roasted already [lah] <malay>pantang</malay> #liao#
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
no it's the it's the monstera with holes but the leaves are smaller and it's not <malay>dia punya</malay>
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
[ah]
you have seen it before [what]
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
wait [lah] <malay>nanti dia dah besar dah</malay> [lah] <malay>letak balik kat dalam</malay>
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
<malay>hari-hari dia berdoa</malay>
should google it up the prayer plant
and (err) it's an indoor plant
(err)
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay [lah]
technically not really [eh] it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
(um)
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
[ah] [ah]
so technically <malay>dia orang punya</malay> care is quite princess [lah] they need the right humidity so it's not that much of an easy easy I mean it's still an easy plant to grow but it's probably not that easy as a fern
<malay>macam gitu kalau kau buat bodoh pun dia macam gitu</malay>
really [meh] I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it (err) refreshes the air [ah] NASA say [one]
really
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
true [lah]
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
!huh!
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
cause like it's not like monstera where you can see that that the leaves <malay>gulung</malay> like that then they will
this thing doesn't <malay>gulung</malay> [what]
shoots [ah] shoots
[oh]
okay [lah] but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
<malay>dia jadi</malay> go
<malay>dia jadi</malay> brown
I didn't know then no I never no [lah] <malay>tak jadi</malay>
<malay>jahat nah aku</malay>
okay wait [ah]
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
ya like it cannot get cold seem like <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>setakat satu malam</malay> [jer]
that is true [hor]
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong (um) so
what sort of plant got [meh]
coconut tree but it's not
<malay>daun</malay>
<malay>kau pergi jemputan mana</malay>
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
<malay>apa</malay> is standard <malay>pokok</malay>
[oh] my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
ya <malay>bodoh</malay>
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
ya so it's a very sturdy plant <malay>dia punya</malay> leaf <malay>macam</malay> like those kind of <malay>pokok pisang punya</malay> leaves but it's (err)
a bit different [lah] the milkshake
of course right cause you are not <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
ya but anyway it's quite (um) it's quite a journey
and I still want to collect more plants hopefully <malay>dia tak mati</malay>
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them (um) water the plant
they never like <malay>pakai</malay> those kind of watering can no like
you know the food container the #dabao# there from container <malay>dia</malay> just scoop <malay>air gitu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay>
like it they pouring into the side [lah] not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like !wow! like that [ah]
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk [what]
<malay>sesungguhnya</malay>
scotch tap [hor] it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
pail of water and pour the plant [mah] <malay>dia pakai</malay> watering can [jer]
so I was quite amazed like [oh] okay you can actually do that
ya I mean they will say [lah] like <malay>macam kalau</malay> the top all the dry then you can water that kind [lah] <malay>bukannya hari-hari dia</malay> water the plant
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care [lah]
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
<malay>jangan beli yang menyemak punya</malay>
no one [lah] not the standard issue plan [lah] and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
(hmm)
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat #jinjja# chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
(err) our christmas gathering [lor] exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill [lah] whatever [lah]
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
!hais!
what's the theme
more than thirty
[oh] I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny [ah] charlotte [lah]
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
(err) ya [ah]
doing comms [ah]
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay [lah] not bad [lah] then sense a different [lor] different vibe here
ya but she's not that far off [lah] if you think about her age and the people there
youngest in amongst us

okay
actually [kan] <malay>aku tak</malay> because (uh) <malay>mak aku</malay> like whenever she cook she will <malay>buka</malay> the YouTube <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> video ya because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> Spotify so she will use the YouTube [ah] while she cook
<malay>tapi macam</malay> a bit <malay>merepek</malay> cause last time can <malay>misteri jam dua belas kat</malay> radio [kan] so you listen to it at night literally before twelve but <malay>ni dia tengok bila tengah macam petang</malay> cause <malay>tengah masak</malay> [kan] you had any stories on your

I never studied music so bila <malay>aku kat</malay> poly [kan]
because in poly I joined
because in poly I joined the percussion <malay>punya</malay> band
and then there was this one part of the test where the instructor <malay>ajar kita orang</malay> how to read music <malay>tapi aku</malay> lost <malay>gila</malay> ya
<malay>aku</malay> lost because like he was teaching us like paradiddle <malay>ke apa entah</malay> how to do the how to keep how to <malay>macam</malay> [ha] stay in beat and listen to the rhythm <malay>ke apa</malay> because our instructor <malay>tu</malay> was from #yuhua# <malay>punya</malay> like some band thing [ah]

(uh) we camp over [kan] but then like before I don't know why but last time
everytime <malay>ada</malay> camp [kan] <malay>mesti ada</malay> that night walk [tau] ya and then before night walk they will always show you <malay>cerita hantu</malay> [tau] <malay>atau cerita seram</malay> before that so for that for that [one] they showed us (uh) movie the orphan I think
really
honestly <malay>aku tak ingat</malay> because
my group was the first group to go off so we couldn't watch the movie (uh)
it was quite scary because the <malay>sekolah</malay> that we had to go was #wak tanjong# ya then #wak tanjong# [kan] it's like

(uh) that road is called (uh) <malay>jalan kubur</malay>
ya basically <malay>sebelah</malay> #aljunied# right so like the entire stretch <malay>semua kubur</malay> [tau] and then it's very like <malay>rapat-rapat</malay>
it's literally next to the <malay>madrasah</malay> it's the I think the the founder of the <malay>sekolah punya</malay> family #aljunied# ya
[oh] because that used to be <malay>dia punya tempat</malay> [ah] like is it like the [ha] the <malay>tanah</malay> or the <malay>kampung</malay> where most of them <malay>tinggal kat situ</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku macam</malay> no because <malay>aku baru perasan</malay> [kan] because that time I I was going home and then <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> bus stop then so I went to the bus stop
literally <malay>belakang</malay> bus stop <malay>tu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sini ada kubur-kubur</malay> then bus stop <malay>kat sini</malay> so <malay>kalau kau nak pergi</malay> bus stop you have to pass by the <malay>kubur</malay> [ah]

the what [oh] they send <malay>benda tu</malay> [ah]
[oh] so they are
!ee! [a'ah]
[oh] so is the person themselves [lah]
actually [kan] <malay>aku ada</malay> question we're because <malay>hantu raya</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> actually <malay>apa</malay>
what is it <malay>asal</malay> why is it called <malay>raya</malay>
ya
ya which reminds me of the incredible tales because <malay>ada</malay> this one episode where
<malay>ada</malay> this group of students <malay>dia pergi</malay> this one area <malay>kat</malay>
I think indonesia and then while they were going up to the <malay>tempat</malay> [kan]
they met (um) some of the some of the people [lah] then they they told them (um) [ah] they went to the shop and then
(uh) they <malay>dia orang</malay>
I don't know if it's a <malay>bomoh</malay> but I think and then she <malay>macam</malay> advice <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia</malay> she advise them about the <malay>macam pantang larang gitu</malay> and then
they violated every single one of them
[a'ah] <malay>yang tu yang tu</malay> [ha] ya
like that [one] is
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] [oh] they they call it
#nananggal# <malay>tak salah</malay>
no [leh]
no no they the it's #nananggal# not <malay>penanggal</malay>
[eh] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] cause [oh]
[oh] so
ya
ya
[oh] <malay>apa</malay> they malay peninsular so <malay>sama hantu</malay> [lah]
so it's not
it's because when I first saw it [kan] [oh] !chey! okay no because I thought at first it's a <malay>pontianak</malay> but then the <malay>cerita tunjukkan</malay> [kan] because the girl was pregnant then she hit the fact from the other friends
so [kan] that thing will
(uh) incredible tales ya that episode no no
ya
[ah] hanging ya
ya
[ah]
okay
[oh] [ah]
ya <malay>kat</malay> singapore
<malay>aku tak pernah nampak</malay> okay okay then
[ah]
that sounds dangerous
[ah]
[ah]
which makes me wonder [tau] because [kan] <malay>dia orang patut</malay> [kan] they can go through
like solid objects <malay>tak boleh</malay> affect them [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> they get stuck
[oh] <malay>amal pengamal</malay> (oo)
(mm)
okay
so he go out and then read
okay
<malay>tu yang aku tak faham</malay> like you would take you would pay lots of money
to <malay>apa tu</malay> get the services of
like <malay>jin dengan bomoh tapi</malay> like <malay>benda</malay> surgery <malay>kau tak nak</malay>
ya <malay>apa yang</malay> natural it's supernatural
okay fine
ya
<malay>seram</malay> [ah] wait then what's the purpose of the <malay>penanggal</malay> like
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I know [oh] the I don't know what's the purpose <malay>tapi aku tahu</malay> like <malay>dekat</malay> episode <malay>tu</malay> they show
(um) that thing was going after the <malay>perempuan yang</malay> pregnant
ya but why I don't know [lah]
what's that
!chey! okay
<malay>apa dia</malay>
I know because like one reasons is because <malay>macam</malay> like they are more vulnerable and then they are <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
like they are more vulnerable because they <malay>ada benda yang orang lain nak tapi tak tak ada tak dapat</malay>
so they try to like steal it from them which is <malay>apa tu</malay> the baby [lah] it's like new life
[a'ah] ya ya <malay>ada ada</malay>
I think
ya ya ya (uh) something right ya [ah]
I mean <malay>kita dah berbual pasal ayat lain semua</malay>
ya <malay>itu</malay> that [one] just
because they they either <malay>makan</malay> the <malay>anak atau</malay> they <malay>curi</malay> the <malay>anak atau</malay> they <malay>ikat</malay> the <malay>rahim</malay> !eww!
ya like finally I know what's the purpose of that [eh] <malay>dia letak garam</malay> [kan] <malay>tak</malay> [eh] <malay>garam</malay>
I'm kind of I don't know this I don't know what's some isn't gonna miss
ya <malay>aku dengar</malay> like if you <malay>letak garam kat luar</malay> your <malay>pintu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> anyone [ha] anyone who <malay>masuk rumah kalau dia ada simpan benda</malay> [kan] that <malay>benda</malay> cannot <malay>masuk rumah</malay>
maybe [ah] it's one of the ways [ah] <malay>yang ada</malay>
<malay>daun</malay>
<malay>sirih</malay> [eh]
<malay>sihir</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>aku tak pernah dengar</malay> is it <malay>melayu punya</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
[oh] <malay>kirakan macam</malay>
they make it they package it [ah] so easy to use [ha]
ya ya ya
they make it into a <malay>sabun</malay> [kan] so <malay>senang</malay>
packaging in marketing
ya
<malay>sambut</malay> what do you mean
[oh] I thought is the doctor [what] or the nurse
hospital legit [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [a'ah] <malay>apa tu yang</malay> the son of a peach <malay>punya cerita</malay> [kan] they were saying <malay>macam</malay> this hospital <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia tengah beranak</malay> [kan] and then she saw a white figure then the nurse <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] that [one] is normal usually when people give birth they always see that figure
ya
[ha]
so <malay>kirakan macam kalau</malay> like you give birth
but then someone <malay>benda lain</malay> might be
what the hell
so is that is that why like hospitals are haunted
deaths
cause thinking <malay>macam sebab</malay> maternity work [kan] like babies <malay>baru keluar</malay>
so it's <malay>seram</malay> [seh] but then <malay>kalau macam</malay> you are if you are in the operating room [kan] and then <malay>kau baru</malay> give birth you know that the doctor is the one that's taking you right
[oh] that's why that [one] <malay>macam</malay> make sure <malay>kalau kau kat dalam</malay> [kan] you have someone like your family there so they can [ha] okay okay
[ah]
[oh] but then <malay>masih baru</malay> [kan] the
sorry [ah] but I have like submissions and an exam coming up
it's like you want to disturb me come back in like two hours let me finish this and submit
yes let me do this until two three five night then you come okay
ya
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>tidur mati</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kau tak baca doa tidur</malay> [eh] <malay>asal</malay> [eh]
[oh] is it
(oo) so if it wakes you up then different story [ah] [ha] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah]
ya
but <malay>apa yang dia</malay> call it <malay>apa</malay> (err) it's not <malay>khayalan</malay> it's like
your imagination [eh]
it's like it's your
imagination [eh] [a'ah] ya [ha]
because very vivid ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
no ya that's what I found out actually actually this [one] the son of a peach also he he posts
the he looked up the stuff [kan] then he saw that actually <malay>jin dengan</malay> you cannot see <malay>jin</malay> and <malay>syaitan</malay> because they are in a different dimension ya so
ya [oh] no no cannot cannot
ya so what happens is that because <malay>kau kena apa tu hasut</malay> [kan]
so whatever that you see is actually just
<malay>macam</malay> is just playing in your head so the <malay>syaitan hasut</malay> you and then <malay>kirakan</malay> they like they are the ones that showing you these images in your head but actually you cannot see them because if you can see if you can see them means you can see the entire dimension [tau] everything that exist in that dimension
ya
true ya
they play with your mind ya ya
(mm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nampak benda tapi orang lain tak nampak</malay> [kan] ya
ya
[seh] okay
ya
also <malay>orang lain yang kena</malay> [ah]
ya
disturb the people around them
ya
<malay>kurang asam</malay>
[oh] no wonder
tap
[oh] tap [ha]
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau pergi jahit malam-malam apa cerita</malay> okay
ya
(mm)
wait so that's one of the ways they <malay>kacau</malay> you [ah]
so <malay>kirakan dia orang</malay> actually <malay>pegang kau</malay> or they just make you think that <malay>ada orang pegang kau</malay>
okay okay okay I don't know
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] poltergeist
[ha] <malay>dia orang selalu buat</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like those supernatural <malay>punya</malay> like
paranormal [eh]
ya
ya I remember I watched the one <malay>yang kat</malay> malaysia [kan] where they the the whole entire team
<malay>kat luar rumah</malay> and then they will send someone into the one of the rooms and then the person will be lying on the ground
and then like <malay>baca-baca</malay> something basically like inviting the <malay>hantu gitu</malay> [ah]
ya but then it's like damn scary because <malay>apa tu</malay>
like the the thing will come to them right and then <malay>apa tu</malay>
the thing will come to the person
and then (err) like they will start like bordering the
<malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] the the <malay>pintu semua gerak</malay> and then they will see like lights and then they will hear sounds and everything
and then and then the person will like try to exit to go back to <malay>dia punya</malay> the team outside right
then like I don't know whether it's true or not because
like usually when they go out they we have like a a <malay>bomoh</malay> on standby <malay>gitu</malay> ya
ya like in case if anything happens [kan]
and then when they go until they will like it it's always like <malay>dia orang macam</malay> trembling or shivering or they say like <malay>dia orang ada rasa benda</malay>
and then like how do you know whether it's true or not
I mean ya but then
(oo) [ah] ya
(mm)
then
singapore
ya why [ah] is it like singapore like <malay>dia orang tak kacau sangat</malay>
!huh!
so you telling me that the <malay>hantu</malay> also like shifted back to the <malay>kampung</malay> then [oh] it became less popular [eh] less demand
ya
(mm)
[oh] I think it's because like is it like people in singapore <malay>tak</malay> practise as much as those
and also because like we don't have much of the resources <malay>juga</malay> [ah] ya really like maybe <malay>ada memang ada</malay> [lah] but like
modernised [eh]
we are religious
ya
[a'ah] [sia]
ya that's true
and like the <malay>pantang larang</malay> for <malay>bomoh</malay> right is more
ya it's so <malay>leceh satu</malay> and then it's like for the rest of your life or for as long as you are using it [kan] but for if you go for plastic surgery it's like
only two three months recovery then can already
ya
no [lah] for boobs it's like you need to change
every like ten years or five years ya
that [one] I don't know [ah] I think maybe it's just the expiry date or what
probably but ya [ha]
it's troublesome
like [kan] <malay>dia cakap tak boleh</malay> you cannot walk under the <malay>galah</malay> but then <malay>kat kampung dulu dia orang pakai galah</malay> #kot#
I I thought they use the clothes line the string <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
and <malay>kenapa galah</malay> like <malay>aku aku tak faham</malay> !huh! what's that
bamboo
[oh] is it they are scared of bamboo
properties [ah] then what if it's made out of metal <malay>atau</malay> plastic
!huh!
there's so many questions that
ya
[oh] [a'ah] [eh] ya
no <malay>bila macam</malay> those extendable <malay>galah</malay> [kan] that [one] made of metal [what] no [meh]
no outside of [oh] ya
no [lah] I mean if you you are drying it [kan] is it's already
like you will <malay>perah</malay> the thing first [what] before you <malay>gantung</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> [tau] <malay>jemur ke apa</malay> ya
so <malay>kirakan</malay> like when you absent-mindedly walked under the <malay>galah</malay> [lah] [ha]
ya
what's [eh] wait but for <malay>susuk kalau terkeluar</malay> you can just <malay>masukkan balik</malay> [kan]
[ha] then
it's <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] it's it's this actual <malay>peniti</malay> [kan] something like that
ya
I know like there used to be this show <malay>dekat</malay> #suria# where
where they show no not <malay>cerita hantu</malay> it's
(err) they ya ya so one of it is <malay>susuk</malay> they show like how the <malay>bomoh</malay> will <malay>masukkan</malay> the <malay>susuk</malay> then they will like [oh] it's <malay>sakit sikit</malay> [tau] so they <malay>masukkan</malay>
ya
and then like if <malay>kalau kau histeria</malay> [kan] you can see the needles in your face
but then <malay>macam</malay> but they say like <malay>kalau</malay> the person who the person who <malay>masukkan</malay>
is the only person who can <malay>keluarkan</malay>
is it so if like ya unless unless if you go under the <malay>galah</malay> and then <malay>dia jatuh sendiri</malay> [ah]
it's either you cannot die or cause <malay>susah nak mati</malay> like the <malay>nazak</malay> right
wait so the person will die [lah] it's just harder
ya
but <malay>tetap</malay> can die [lah] so okay [ah]
because if you cannot die [ah] <malay>habis</malay> suffer like that
so <malay>tak mati</malay> [ah] [oh] take it out
[oh] ya ya ya so it's like a
(oo)
ya
is it like
is it like your senses are still intact [eh] for a few it's like paralysis
ya
you know I I would just feel stuffy because
the <malay>kafan</malay> and everything
ya but it's like you <malay>tangan semua</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>sejuk</malay> [siol]
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tak pakai stokin</malay>
ya ya ya
wait so they don't they don't bury you with <malay>kain batik kain batik</malay> is before [kan]
the funeral right [oh] !chey! ya so <malay>kiranya bila masuk kau keluarkan dari batik</malay> [ah]
<malay>nasi lemak</malay> [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] no no no because [kan]
<malay>kalau kau dah keluarkan</malay> the
<malay>batik</malay> [kan] would you want to still use the <malay>batik</malay>
[kan]
(mm)
no [lah] it's just
[ha]
[oh]
<malay>ular</malay>
<malay>atau</malay> like the the the soil wouldn't stay right ya
ya
[oh] my my mum said like if
(err) she said like <malay>ni orang-orang dulu kata</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if you are at the funeral [kan] <malay>jangan diri depan kaki mayat</malay> because in case <malay>kalau bukan-bukan kalau</malay> like the person <malay>pernah ada simpan barang</malay> [kan] they might pass it to you ya so don't like stand I don't know how true this is [ah] but
ya but I thought like <malay>kalau</malay>
[ah] ya
then do what
or really well what did you say
is it like what if you say [eh] what if you just nod is that considered
[oh] my
so if like they ask you ya that's what I thought [ah] my mum you supposed to pass the thing <malay>bila dia masa hidup</malay> [kan] not <malay>bila dah mati</malay>

that's why should be free
#yishun#
island [eh] !wow!
[oh]
(uh) what's the island what's the island by #punggol# called [ah]
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by #punggol# I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called [lah]
[oh] yes coney island coney island yes yes yes

I think it's more interesting how the cow ended up there
I guess ya
(oo) maybe ya
agaknya agaknya apa lembu tu nak kena sembelih</malay> or something <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>abeh dia punya</malay> family member like one of the family members is like no I love this cow let's brought over to that the island
I guess what happened
[oh] wait but I mean how old can how how old can the <malay>lembu</malay> be [sia]
I think I was thinking that like
in a situation where <malay>kampung</malay> is still
present you know and then like they need so many <malay>lembu</malay>
I mean like nobody care less somebody's <malay>lembu</malay>
#kampong glam#
!wah! serious [ah] [oh] I think I heard of that
[oh] <malay>kau</malay> film <malay>kat sana</malay>

right
[oh] ya I remember that
(mm)
<malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [sia]
ya
but
were they trying to colonize area
<malay>ada ramai orang tinggal sana</malay> [eh]
[orh]
then <malay>dia orang kerja apa</malay> [seh]
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
!wah! that's cool
(mm)
<malay>tempat dia besar</malay>
!wah!
that's really nice [eh] I want I want to move there [sia]
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big [ah]
the place
[orh] [orh]
[orh] so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside [ah]
then <malay>waktu tu dah dah malam</malay> [eh]
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
<malay>nampak apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>nampak muka kau</malay>
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone [ah]
I mean alone with her friends
(um) <malay>yang dia boleh nampak</malay>
singapore <malay>ada tempat apa lagi yang</malay>
all the nature reserves [lor]
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near #mandai# area there it's like a hidden
hidden <malay>bukit</malay> I think
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
<malay>habis sini</malay> #mandai# also so if you're bored you can just go next door [ah] see
<malay>monyet</malay>
yes
actually I don't know [eh]
the animals all wear masks
the features [ah]
[oh] ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
and then and then join the let them join <malay>lembu</malay> in <malay>pulau</malay>
#pulau semakau# the place coney island
ya
[oh] ya [sia] I think I think last time <malay>aku pergi</malay> zoo [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh] maybe like <malay>tiga tahun yang lepas</malay>
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you [lah]
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something [kan]
thing is three years is quite okay [lah] [kan]
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats [lah]
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
[oh] ya
I forgot [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> old age right they said
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
[oh] ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from #yishun#
you never went
!huh!
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four [ah]
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
timing <malay>dia</malay> quite risky
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
[orh]
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what !huh!
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and #changi# airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on #changi# airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
!hais!
<malay>kalau kalau kau ada tiga</malay> wishes <malay>kau nak kau nak</malay> wish <malay>apa</malay>
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be (uh) happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
[oh] shit
genie
you [eh] what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
!huh!
[oh] never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay [lah] I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
[ah]
what would I want
[ah]
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
(uh)
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
[oh] my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long [eh] from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
how different it will be if we <malay>apa</malay> we never had COVID
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
[oh] shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
[oh] ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
[oh] ya and that as well
(uh huh)
[oh] ya
I think you like got scanned use your and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the code is already enough [what]
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay [ah]
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all [lah] but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
[ah]
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
<malay>aku suka</malay> [ah] <malay>kucing</malay>

I think she's like
also like very
(uh) she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now [eh]
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy

it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
<malay>batuk</malay>
then <malay>sekarang dah dah</malay> okay [ah]
[oh] ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya

like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do [lah]
(mm) ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
(uh) human civilizations will be like
(uh)
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example [lah] then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like (uh) like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
(uh) issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
[oh] no [lah] like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff [lah] like taking care
(uh) like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
just <malay>berhenti</malay> in all of the seven hundred languages
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like [ah] I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like (uh) like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
you should just you should just go up there and then you just say <malay>kalau kau orang semua</malay> stop [ah] stop it
<malay>kau orang semua sekarang</malay>
<malay>hentikan ini semua</malay>
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
[oh] yes yes yes
[oh] ya <malay>merepek gila</malay> [sia]
that's so sad
<malay>kalau itu kalau kawan aku yang aku</malay> confirm <malay>macam sedih</malay> [sia]
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
to <malay>bunuh</malay>
if I was the judge I would say that
just
<malay>kau hentikan sekarang pembunuh</malay>
[oh] ya that's like really
[oh] why
okay I think we're gonna be done soon
ya okay [ah] next time [ah]

I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
(mmhmm)
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] [sia] like a blessing in disguise [ah] [eh]
okay [lah]
<malay>kerja aku rabak juga</malay> [ah] like because I don't know whether
you heard
but
(um) <malay>kerja aku</malay> recently <malay>buang orang</malay> like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left <malay>semua nak kena buat</malay> you know pick up the slack <malay>abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat</malay>
I was not as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now [lah] but (um) you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done [ah]
ya actually I am most of the time only like (err) two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
everything can be done via the laptop [lah] but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to <malay>apa tu</malay> collect <malay>dia punya</malay> physical mails
cause there are some like letters from (err) the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
[eh] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> imagine [sia] like I will I cannot even you know
both of us <malay>ada</malay> short attention span and like to have
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
<malay>abeh</malay> like you can't even like focus and
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time [lah]
a few hours at least
in a week
ya [lah] I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
(mm)
!huh! as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
ya I know you always do [lah] you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere [lah]
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
[oh]
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you [ah] like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
<malay>banyak orang juga</malay> like you know stress eat
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age (um)
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one (um) app away or one call away so
(mm)
is it I never heard of that before
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
[oh]
I see I will check that out I think one day <malay>aku</malay> check it out
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's fun speaking of <malay>joget</malay> recently also like literal you know literally yesterday (err) me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through <malay>macam</malay> dance <malay>punya</malay> youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing [kan] <malay>kau</malay> you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to <malay>kau buat</malay> like (um)
HIIT workouts I mean that works better [lah] because you know it's a specific <malay>punya macam</malay> (err) they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then (um) she she we decided to because we have four I mean she we decided to <malay>apa tu</malay> download
this thing (err) this game <malay>apa</malay> just dance [eh] ya so we've had we've yet to try that (err) it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good [ah]
like you feel more refreshed <malay>abeh nanti kau tak</malay> feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time (err) always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
as cliche as it sounds [lah]
I'm not one to preach but it is important [lah] cause now also <malay>zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang</malay> all fast food and things like that you know as compared to <malay>zaman dulu</malay> [kan] they're more much more
(um) healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my (err) to get my workout in [ah] on a daily
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes <malay>pun jadi</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau tahu tak aku</malay>
highly ambitious <malay>niat tu ada</malay> but <malay>selalu tak kesampaian</malay> like I set my alarm on at six in the morning everyday <malay>macam berangan</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam kau nak</malay> [oh] <malay>berangan nak</malay> jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour [ah]
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> start the start my day right you know working and then like <malay>macam</malay> feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said [ah] <malay>tadi</malay> you just have to be consistent [ah]
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] is it
(mmhmm)
<malay>kena</malay> monitor [ah]
what's the average [ah] what's the ideal
that's normal [ah] [ah]
that plays a part [ah]
ya (mm)
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
ya like <malay>macam</malay> if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you <malay>macam tak nampak</malay> so tired or worn out [tau]
(mm)
<malay>asal kau menyesal</malay>
ya [lah] it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more (um) you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad [what] I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face [sial] babe
[oh] no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
<malay>aku memang suka</malay> like dark (err) like because I don't know like
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tak lawa sangat</malay> [ah]
ya I hang it like <malay>macam</malay> fairy lights around <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [ah] my my bedroom <malay>punya</malay> frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> because I prefer to use like <malay>macam</malay> candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that <malay>kalau</malay> fairy lights when you switch it on [kan]
okay [lah]
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on [lah]
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings [ah] different modes that you can choose from like <malay>macam</malay> those like blinking ones or like <malay>macam</malay> !alah! you know <malay>macam lampu lap lip</malay> [lah] basically
it's like that
ya
[oh] yes it's right there
ya I use it is <malay>dia macam</malay> aurora lights
no [lah] I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep [lah] <malay>bila aku nak</malay> you know feeling spa day <malay>nak</malay> relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
<malay>bila aku nyanyi</malay> ya <malay>bila aku nyanyi nak</malay> feeling feeling
you know me too well
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>kita dah kawan</malay>
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no

and then now we are like [oh] my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
<malay>tak tahu</malay> it's like literally after school it's not
even during school we don't really talk to each other [kan]
[ah] [eh] speaking of which <malay>tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun</malay> like literally random [ah] like <malay>aku tak rapat dengan dia pun</malay> like <malay>tu pun aku</malay> that time <malay>kerja</malay> part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then (err) <malay>kita tak</malay> contact <malay>pun</malay> and then after that random after few years <malay>aku jumpa dia dekat</malay> (err) #tioman# island <malay>ke apa</malay> then random <malay>gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to #bali# and then I met her again just now so <malay>macam</malay> random [lah] like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to <malay>macam</malay> like meet them often but
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
(mmhmm)
[oh] [ah] <malay>tu pun</malay> random [seh] <malay>kau pun pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan dia juga</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
anyway speaking of which how's your love life <malay>dah lama aku tak dengar apa</malay> any anything new that you want to talk to me about
(mm)
(mm)
the last time <malay>kau cakap dengan aku dia</malay>
something about his throat [eh] <malay>sakit ke apa</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>rajin</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
(mm)
ya
(mm)
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know <malay>macam</malay> you gave so much (um) care and concern love to others
obviously you don't expect the same in return [lah] <malay>kau ikhlas memang</malay> but
you know (um) from what you're telling me
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like <malay>macam</malay> it's one sided like you
like
the effort
is only at your end
you know then <malay>bila kau sakit tangan ni semua</malay> I mean it's not it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so <malay>macam</malay> he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like <malay>macam</malay> all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times [lah] but
(err) it is all about compromising and <malay>macam</malay> if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
you know like (um) in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
then <malay>entah</malay> [eh] do you really think it's worth it then
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow! that really open up like
a lot of things like <malay>macam</malay>
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay [lah] (um) being in a relationship of friends [ah] like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this (um) saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like (err) people come and go
and especially when the (err) when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men [lah] but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women [eh] I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay (um) you know
(um) you shouldn't get back to your (err) to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly [kan] (err) maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my no not experience [lah] but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense [ah] I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
!aww!
!aww! so cute
a book like a diary
[oh] right okay
[oh] my gosh
[eh] but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
[eh] that is actually a good thing like (um) it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know (um) on paper
(mm)
then it hit you [ah]
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like (um)
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
(um)
!aww! <malay>dia</malay> blue tick <malay>kau</malay> [oh] <malay>dia</malay> seen <malay>kau</malay> [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up [ah] then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
[oh] my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes <malay>dia yang paling</malay> decent
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
(mm)
ya [lah] like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up [eh] not not the cause of your okay [lah] somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay [lah] I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya [lah] but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
!aww!
!wow! you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
[eh] [oh] my gosh
I mean
if you may never know <malay>mana tahu</malay>
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly [eh] when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
(err) it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead [lah] it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on (err) cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay [lah]
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know (um) but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so <malay>kau</malay> just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me I know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head [kan] <malay>bila kau</malay> like you know
late at night <malay>kau tak boleh tidur</malay> thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
you know
but (err) do you know if he's attached now or not
[oh] my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually [ah] you don't like <malay>macam</malay> don't don't make it obligatory for him
<malay>kau tanya</malay> [jer]
[oh] is it
and then <malay>kau</malay> action [ah] treat him for his birthday or what
ya I don't give a shit anymore [sia] I can't even remember
<malay>bila</malay> birthday <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>dekat tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> action <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
<malay>tak</malay>
ya or (um) no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like (err) <malay>jual mahal</malay> but at the same time like !hey! you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
[eh] isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah (um) let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
(err) do you have any plans <malay>macam</malay> a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like <malay>macam</malay> (err) let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to (err) do you have any plans <malay>macam</malay> like secretly hoping him would to say yes
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
<malay>kau</malay> set reminder set reminder
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
<malay>dia sama</malay> age <malay>dengan kita</malay> [eh] [oh]
[eh] you don't don't say that about yourself [lah] you are amazing
(mm) (mm)
[oh] my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
an hour we should like start a podcast or something [lah] it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also [lah] <malay>dah lama kita tak jumpa</malay> [kan] and and it's like so good to to finally you know
[eh] ya [oh] my god I almost forgot about our #makisan#

then (uh) <malay>tu tu</malay> one of the difficulties [lah]
ya I can see

I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience <malay>untuk orang-orang macam dia orang</malay> [ah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> actually my parents <malay>pun dah berumur juga</malay>
so
it's it's good [lah] to bring them
<malay>macam dia orang boleh tengok permandangan</malay>

my parents <malay>pun bukannya pergi</malay>
<malay>jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun</malay> (err) indonesia

indonesia <malay>punya</malay> view <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> new zealand new zealand <malay>macam</malay> [ah] then also <malay>dia punya</malay> climate <malay>pun</malay>
(err) <malay>lain ada sejuk sikit</malay> ya (mm) (mm) (mm)
[ah]
(mm) correct <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>orang melayu</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita punya apa lidah</malay> or something [eh] our taste buds [lah] <malay>macam mesti kena ada pedas</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> or <malay>mesti ada</malay>
<malay>sambal ke apa ke</malay> (err) <malay>kalau macam</malay> bland <malay>ke macam</malay> let's say <malay>pergi</malay> western <malay>punya</malay> country <malay>macam makan</malay> pasta <malay>ke makan macam</malay> cream cream or cheese (mm) <malay>tak semua orang macam melayu suka</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>sambal tumis</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] okay [lah] interesting
ya
(mm) (mm) [ah] ya [lah]
ya [lah] different perception <malay>macam orang pergi dengan</malay> parents <malay>mana pergi dengan</malay>
<malay>kawan pun macam mana</malay> [kan] ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's <malay>sebab sebab</malay> (err)
<malay>sebab apa kita macam</malay> (err) sometimes <malay>kalau</malay> okay [lah] like when we were young
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that [lah] but with friends [ah] you have to consider all of these things [lah] budgeting [lah] <malay>apa</malay> all that
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season [ah] (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
I see actually no I mean
(err) spring is considered (err) winter right or is it after winter sorry [kan] ya but I I mean I personally also like winter [lah]
but (err) winter like it's very fun [lah] cause
like when that time I went to (err) europe [ah] then I experience the snow and all so it was (err) quite fun like you can have snowball fights <malay>semua</malay> ya then like you do all the silly silly things [lah] ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore [kan]
ya so but (err) how to say <malay>macam</malay> the aesthetic
aesthetically I would prefer (err) autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice [lah] ya
(mm) ya correct
(mmhmm) ya ya is like
(uh) I think jackets at least we can still save [lah] for our next few trips <malay>ke apa</malay> ya ya hopefully get to experience again
once the this is all over [kan]
(mm) like you really (mm)
!wow!
(err) [oh] ya okay [dah] <malay>pernah pergi</malay> [lah] ya I went before (uh) once ya
it was it was actually during autumn [lah] that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like !huh! korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>orang dia</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like the the people there are really polite
polite <malay>gila</malay> like they
they are very (err)
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you [one] without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire [lah] about them
then so ya singapore (err) ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya [lah] but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way [lah] right
since young so
that's why
[ah] then [orh]
(mm) you should try the <malay>apa</malay>
there's the bullet train [lah] ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no [lah] I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train [lah] it's just the high speed train which
like normal [lah] I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's (uh) the food
really
(mm) ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places [what] so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan
ya so it's it's good [lah]
I think it'll be a good experience right
ya so
!wah! all this conversation about travelling makes me want to
(err) miss I really miss travelling [lah] like (err) (mm) ya ya ya (mmhmm) (mmhmm) ya

[oh] okay so what like <malay>sekarang</malay> like what line you you at like (uh) what industry
[oh] (um) early childhood
ya but I <malay>pun macam</malay> not really (um) into it yet <malay>macam</malay> how how do I say it <malay>macam dulu</malay> I
<malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>baru</malay> [jer] because
ya I <malay>baru</malay> graduate (uh) last year as in actually this year [lah] the <malay>apa tu</malay> during the period actually suppose to have our (um) ceremony [kan] <malay>tapi tak boleh</malay> ya so I'm the unlucky batch
(uh) singapore poly (um) I (uh) [oh] [oh] sorry you don't know ya
ya (um) ya so (um) I I got into an internship <malay>dia ajar bukan ajar</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's speech and drama so I (um) my course actually applied drama and psychology (uh) so <malay>macam</malay> my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they <malay>macam</malay> post me to (uh) this early childhood not early childhood [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like somewhat <malay>macam budak-budak dia macam</malay> actually interested (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I got confuse I think I more interested in the (uh) in the drama side instead of teaching <malay>budak-budak</malay>
ya
when I was in internship [oh] (uh) so <malay>pagi kita</malay> okay (uh) so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so <malay>pagi</malay> (uh) <malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's just admin job then the admin job <malay>pun macam</malay> like <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] I mean like it was difficult because halfway <malay>kita punya</malay> supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in (uh) the company because of some things happen (uh) then (uh) so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then <malay>baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang</malay> for class [kan] then we are just I'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just (uh) <malay>tolong</malay> the teacher to just hype the class <malay>nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap</malay> something funny then we're just like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stupid <malay>gitu tapi macam</malay>
ya it's like to encourage them to <malay>macam</malay> speak up <malay>macam</malay> do do the drama with them <malay>macam</malay> we will have like (um) dramas (uh) drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
okay okay
ya so like now I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I <malay>nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak</malay> or like I I'm just interested in the dramas side
(um) actually it's not like allow allow not like <malay>dia orang suka-suka nak</malay> allow but it's like (um) it's a bit unethical for me to work there also [lah] because like (err) I've been having <malay>macam</malay> low moods and stuff so <malay>macam kesian the budak-budak</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so <malay>macam</malay> I I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if it's because of my (um) my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how I feel right now that's why I'm (um) but I I came clean to my boss like I <malay>bilang dia</malay> (uh) whatever that's been happening in my life then she say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) I don't think you're you're capable of working now so <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> set my head straight [lah] (uh) maybe I need to seek for help I go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel <malay>macam</malay> hundred percent here [lah] because like right now you're a like everywhere
ya
to to work he he he said you can go back right
ya existed that this he welcomes welcomed back then that's good
(mm) but like (um) ya
(mm)
[oh]
ya
ya
and that's a big decision to make [seh] because like (um) it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then <malay>macam</malay> in the future like <malay>kalau lambat</malay> then you it's hard for you to change but now <malay>macam</malay> is the time (um) for us to <malay>macam</malay> explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow I feel
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]

(mm)
(mm) (mm)

(mm) (mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>berapa lama</malay> the the webinar
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] but like !huh!
ya
(hmm)
that sounds great then I think (err) my sister also took that job [ah] last month but like so like webinar you don't have to go to any venue [kan]
(hmm)
!wow! that's really good because like actually (um) when I joined the company the one that I'm taking a break now I actually suppose to go for a class to <malay>macam</malay> a diploma conversion ya so but then (um) for now obviously cannot (uh) go to the school [lah] the <malay>tapi nanti</malay> if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I I don't know I feel like <malay>macam</malay> its a bit more demanding in a way <malay>macam</malay> and like I don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want I think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit <malay>macam</malay> focused on like just real school
[oh] no (uh) it's not (uh) teaching the kids at home but (err) <malay>apa itu</malay> it's just like normal school <malay>macam</malay> we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning <malay>baru kita</malay> teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two (um) one we teach the kids at school real kids then <malay>balik</malay> then (err) the teacher that lecturer will teach us <malay>pula</malay> on like about kid
(um) honestly I feel like a bit <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because I I didn't go for it yet [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class <malay>tapi</malay> (um) from what I think [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it depends on the company you work with <malay>kalau</malay> the company <malay>macam</malay> give you a lot of (uh) things to do like homework <malay>macam</malay> preparing worksheets for the kids <malay>tu semua</malay> they don't have like a proper system like <malay>tak ada macam mana</malay> [eh] they <malay>tak ada</malay> their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so <malay>macam</malay> it's that already a a lot of workload then <malay>kita pergi sekolah</malay> we have also we also have our assignment and like test <malay>tu semua</malay> ya so it's like it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> scary [kan]
[ah]
ya I feel I felt that way [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> that's why I felt really <malay>macam</malay> (um) I'm scared like I I had I had a meltdown <malay>semua</malay>
(um) I think they because there's only one that just (uh) finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said <malay>macam</malay> is going to be difficult [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> (um) the <malay>tempat kerja</malay> even weekend sometimes the boss I think <malay>macam</malay> she didn't like intentionally do this <malay>tapi macam</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay> she will like text us during the weekends <malay>macam</malay> to tell us need to do this this this so <malay>macam</malay> (um) my colleague <malay>yang</malay> just finish the diploma <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then <malay>macam</malay> we we also have the our stuff to do so <malay>macam</malay> she she felt like it's a bit difficult [lah] to go through
that so <malay>macam</malay> she she was concerned about me [lah] because like she she knew that (uh) it's going to be tough for me and especially now [kan] (um) that's not enough teacher the card the company so so <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of <malay>macam</malay> pressure on on the new teachers <malay>macam kita</malay> not teachers [lah] <malay>macam</malay> supposedly I'm not supposed to teach [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> they try their best not to <malay>macam</malay> expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because I'm just program helper <malay>tapi macam</malay> sometimes <malay>nak tak nak macam takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nak biarkan</malay> the company to drown [kan] like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya <malay>macam</malay> that's why <malay>macam</malay> she say it will be early will be more tough on me [lah] because everything is new then <malay>nak kena belajar nak kena</malay> adapt to the changes then like (uh) <malay>nak kena apa belajar lagi</malay>
(hmm) ya ya
so now you doing (um) a part time and working it's continue working at your industry or like on break too
(hmm)
[oh]
(hmm)
true
ya true
(hmm) (hmm)
[oh] so how is it so far
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) ya
#amin# sure #inshaallah#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya that's why (hmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's good
[ah] [ah]
[oh]
stress free
[oh] man ya that feels like me
!wah!
but then like okay so why why <malay>macam</malay> I'm stressing myself [kan] like I agree with you <malay>macam</malay> since since secondary school I already told myself <malay>macam kalau tak</malay> happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as I'm happy then I will continue then (um) but then now [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I know okay deep down I I didn't tell anyone [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know deep down that I'm not happy with working with children now then but then <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>takut</malay> because I didn't have any other choice as of now like I haven't explore other than theatre <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this <malay>nak buat</malay> theatre <malay>macam mana</malay> [kan] like there's no audience but I know there's some like <malay>macam</malay> virtual and stuff but then <malay>macam</malay> virtual I feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously (err) you it's easier for you to (um)
(uh) to stay there [lah] <malay>macam</malay> to continue from where you are <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> you are not in the theatre company then <malay>macam susah nak dapat nak ada</malay> audition <malay>pun tak ada</malay>
ya
early childhood (um) the thing is like for early childhood [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak ada</malay> (um) much experience other than my internship internship ya so (err) I and I also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so I feel like (um) there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then
ya the conversion is (err) is (err) the company itself <malay>yang</malay> I am in right now is actually <malay>macam</malay> they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that (um) she <malay>tak ini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> expect us to stay very long she just (uh) provide a platform for a like a stepping stone <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> she she encourages people to ya she <malay>macam</malay> looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing <malay>macam</malay> I know deep down that I am interested in theatre [lah] to I want to <malay>macam</malay> act again and stuff <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know in singapore <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so much that's the pressure [lah] ya I want to do theatre <malay>tapi macam</malay> I know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
(uh) for like <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay> early childhood then I don't feel that happy so but then <malay>macam</malay> and early childhood is not bad the the pay [kan] especially in singapore because they need people but then like (um) and like if I don't continue for early childhood I <malay>macam</malay> I just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit [lah] honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like <malay>macam</malay> average [lah] <malay>tapi jap</malay> [eh] my mum my mum is like texting me
ya ya okay later I come back to that
I'm twenty
ya
[oh] okay
that's good
(mm) ya
that's that's sweet because like my mom <malay>dia macam</malay> passive aggressive <malay>tak tahu nak cakap macam mana</malay> it's like ya she <malay>macam</malay> I (um) because <malay>dari kecil</malay> we don't really <malay>macam</malay> (um) not very affectionate we are <malay>macam</malay> okay ya so <malay>macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia</malay> a bit awkward <malay>macam nak</malay> open up <malay>pun</malay> a bit awkward
then <malay>macam</malay> every time <malay>macam dari kecil</malay> I <malay>nangis</malay> about like [oh] my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so <malay>macam</malay> like she taught me to be tough [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like (err) emotions she put away emotions <malay>tu</malay> so <malay>macam sekarang</malay> I <malay>sedih</malay> I <malay>marah</malay> or like anything [lah] then I cannot like go to her to talk about things [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> I try my best <malay>walaupun dia macam</malay> push or try to avoid the emotion [kan] I will just like
try my best to explain to her [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what I'm feeling this way because this this this <malay>tapi</malay> then but I will text her I I cannot talk to her face to face because every time I <malay>cakap</malay> face to face she will <malay>macam</malay> like (um) suddenly become very cold then <malay>macam</malay> don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things <malay>macam</malay> (err) (err) if you cannot do it then I cannot force you <malay>macam</malay> that kind of stuff you know so <malay>macam</malay> I know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not <malay>macam</malay> put any pressure on me but <malay>macam</malay> that itself already made me (err) pressurize ya
(mm)
ya
so so it's like (um) so if I (uh) like I what I wanted to say just now was (um) because if I don't want to continue with this early childhood right my other choice is only the theatre come a theatre industry but then like I know theatre industry won't make much money [lah] as compared to early childhood
!huh! (err) (err) I I have seniors but then <malay>macam</malay> I don't really talk to them <malay>macam</malay> I really never never like try before because like I in the back of my mind I already told myself like I don't want to start if I start then like I scared like I'm stuck there <malay>macam</malay> I don't want to stop ya
ya so <malay>macam</malay> I go for the safest (uh) option first which is the early childhood [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> but the thing is like I know deep down I am not happy with it <malay>tapi macam kalau</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> go out of it I'm like I don't know where to go you know like I don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then <malay>macam</malay>
and also I'm thinking about because I have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off [lah] I would I would say so <malay>macam</malay> if like I don't have any this is just me [lah] (err) if I don't have any <malay>macam</malay> (um) any education or like any specific job in mind I scared <malay>macam</malay> like not good enough you know this is [kan]
(mm)
[ah]
(hmm) (hmm)
ya so (um) ya [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) as of now he keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> don't worry don't worry <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like (um) that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
like like (err) have you have you talk to your your boyfriend if you don't mind sharing
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
so he's okay [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
[oh] that's good
(mm) (mm) ya so like <malay>sekarang</malay> I I don't know if I'm doing the right thing [lah] because (um) it was a hard decision for me to make to like (uh) stop whatever I was doing like I totally like left the company (um) not preparing any anything for them <malay>macam macam</malay> very abruptly [lah] the I didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the one that just went through the conversion she <malay>macam</malay> very quite helpful [lah] she <malay>macam</malay> keep on saying [oh] it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat (err) ya we teaching the we we you <malay>macam</malay> assisting the same class
(mm)
(hmm) (hmm) but I didn't I didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assisting (um) the the same level [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I was (err) more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan]
then like (um) the the thing is they they have this thing in the company <malay>macam kalau</malay> craft teacher <malay>dengan</malay> language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then I think she didn't she didn't get that (err) idea so <malay>macam</malay> most of the time I was doing the craft then <malay>macam balik pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft weekends <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> craft so <malay>macam</malay> like it was really a lot of stress for me [lah] ya then (err) <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> I that point of time <malay>geram dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia</malay> keep on saying <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I'll do it I'll do it <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>tak buat</malay> so I <malay>macam</malay> pressured [lah] because I'm the one who carry out the craft lesson [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the one
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it was really really irritating then <malay>sampai</malay> like (um) the colleagues (uh) [ah] my other colleagues we very small company [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> they they saw me struggling <malay>gitu macam</malay> everyday I supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then (err) I my contract <malay>pula</malay> my timing ends at one thirty [ah] but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty <malay>gitu tapi</malay> my my timing [kan] I'm always there until four until three so <malay>macam</malay>
no no that's that's the thing so the company <malay>macam</malay> we already say in the contract so <malay>macam</malay> it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so <malay>macam</malay> ya that sucks [lah] that's <malay>macam</malay> that's why I feel like <malay>macam kalau</malay> I continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm <malay>rabak</malay>
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so (um) if you have a diploma already but then you want to to <malay>macam</malay> decided to go for early childhood industry [kan] so you can apply at an at and then (err) and will consider [ah] <malay>macam</malay> but most of the time they will they will accept you [ah] because <malay>macam tak banyak</malay> in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya <malay>tak</malay> I don't think is [lah] because like (um) it this is there's a stereotype of like (err) early childhood teachers gets a lot of because (um) there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that <malay>tak banyak</malay> in singapore <malay>nak buat</malay>
ya I don't know what to say about that so (err) so the the the diploma conversion (um) after we apply but then (err) we we find a company first [lah] we find the company we can get sponsorship if we work with the company less than six months
then (um) if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the and then you see then you say [lah] the company wants to sponsor you then (um) they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so <malay>macam</malay> diploma <malay>tu semua macam</malay> (uh) your O level english <malay>tu semua</malay> and then (err) they will contact you [lah] [eh] but there's only like two two openings every year if I'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and (um) october
ya
(uh) I right now I don't know if I want to continue [lah] because like after talking to you then <malay>macam</malay> like really make me realize <malay>macam</malay> ya I should just <malay>macam</malay> do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if I'm not happy like how long will that last
(hmm)
(hmm)
(um) that's that's good but then like (um) that's I used to have savings (um) before before joining the company [kan] and then like but the thing is I I thought I was going for the diploma conversion right so I my laptop <malay>rosak</malay> so I decided to buy a new laptop [lah] so because I was thinking okay with the pay that I'm getting then <malay>macam</malay> the laptop won't be so much [lah] and I also look for a cheap laptop not like <malay>macam</malay> one thousand plus <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then (um) after I got the laptop so <malay>macam</malay> my savings to <malay>terjejas</malay> like affected already then then like (err) when I join the company then I got the pay already right then <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] my first pay so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>belanja</malay> my my family to eat <malay>tu semua</malay> then like my boyfriend leaving so <malay>macam</malay> I help him with (um) (err) not help him <malay>macam</malay> like I give him as a gift to <malay>semua macam barang-barang</malay> for but not everything [lah] within just a few then <malay>macam</malay> I didn't expect this to happen like I didn't expect that myself will like (um) broke <malay>macam</malay> mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like (um) I I didn't expect things to happen then <malay>macam</malay> my savings <malay>pun</malay> now like <malay>terjejas</malay> my laptop like I'm not really using my laptop that much then <malay>macam</malay> I really feel <malay>macam</malay> everything is just
it's just <malay>cubaan</malay> now [lah]
(uh) haven't yet because like I it's just everything just started I just really like (err) I just quit my job last week
ya but it's very pressurizing [lah] because like
(hmm)
ya but like I like mention [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to continue with early childhood or not and also like I feel it's a bit unfair if I go for another early childhood company but I never tell my my (err) my boss that I don't want to work with her anymore
(uh) no I actually still have contract before until next year december ya
(err) she if I terminate the contract supposingly I have to pay like six thousand dollars
(um) so but a bit too <malay>macam</malay> you know so that people don't just terminate contracts <malay>suka hati</malay> ya so but I I brought it up to her [lah] about my situation <malay>tu semua</malay> but she quite understanding she say <malay>macam</malay> the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality [lah] it's not really <malay>macam</malay> to force to force you to pay or what
so <malay>macam</malay> she just <malay>macam</malay> let (err) let me (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> not pay it [eh] not pay her and just <malay>macam</malay> take a break first but like (err) she say if I feel better then I can I can continue working with her [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> as of now I kinda have this feeling that I won't continue with her [lah] because really make
(err) I I don't think so I I ya that's good but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> I feel the guilt [lah] because I told her that I want to continue working but like (um) I for now I cannot continue first I regret for saying that [lah] honestly because like at that point of time I really you <malay>macam</malay> have a lot in mind so <malay>macam</malay> I tell her stuff that I <malay>macam</malay> regret now
(hmm)
I I don't know why I as of now I really <malay>macam</malay> feel like everything is (err) falling apart [lah] because (um) ya [lah] because of the job then until I don't know if I want to continue then about my health also I'm not really stable right now then (um) my my boyfriend I mention him right then he just left for his yesterday I mean he's just it's just <malay>tapi macam</malay> I had a past of like my (err) my father's death so <malay>macam</malay> it kind of like triggered me [lah] just <malay>macam</malay> ya that's what I'm thinking so like (um) he him leaving my changes trigger everything [lah] so (err) I'm feeling like really really <malay>macam</malay> at my lowest right now [lah] ya so <malay>macam</malay> I feel <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya so I don't know what to do right you know that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm supposed to take a break during <malay>tapi macam</malay> my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working <malay>macam</malay> why am I gonna do what am I gonna do but then <malay>macam</malay> I need to <malay>macam</malay> ya so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm really lost right now [lah] so I'm trying my best to <malay>macam</malay> look for freelance work from home kind of thing

ya that's true
no they didn't
(err) ya [lah] doesn't <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> I just feel a lot of guilt (err) towards the company so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> if I want to bring it up or not [ah] because (err) then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then <malay>macam</malay> they cutting from my <malay>gaji</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> I already had in mind okay my <malay>gaji</malay> month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then I can find like part time job and then I (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> when I terminate the contract means I'm not continuing the the diploma they <malay>rupanya</malay> they will like <malay>macam</malay> will not get a refund if I <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>gaji dah kurang</malay> then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means I have to pay [kan] obviously the company won't ask won't <malay>macam</malay> want to pay for no reason so like I think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then <malay>macam</malay> !aduh! <malay>sedih gila</malay> [seh]
ya
so it's like
like like I said [lah] that's why <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life (um) because like money wise then <malay>macam</malay> like (um) my boyfriend left for <malay>rasa macam</malay> got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really [lah] what's the everything is just falling apart
I have <malay>kakak</malay> but then like she she move out already because she <malay>nikah</malay>
(hmm) two actually but (um) my I'm not close to my eldest one because (uh) she we <malay>lain mak</malay>
<malay>sama bapak lain mak</malay>
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya
so
(um)
I think I for now I should just find jobs that's like (um) that won't bring that I won't bring it back home <malay>macam buat kerja kat situ</malay> then <malay>balik tak buat apa-apa</malay>
<malay>macam kalau penat penat kat kerja</malay> [jer]
I mean other than like there's (um) part time like <malay>macam</malay> F&B <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] guess can can do that <malay>tapi macam</malay> I don't know I kind of I'm not (um) I I have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I can (uh) I can stay in can do that kind of part time but <malay>macam</malay> if there's no choice then I don't mind trying also now
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm)
ya
ya maybe I could think of that too
(um) that's true [oh] my god I need to keep you on reminding myself that
(err) actually I just when yesterday (um) ya but then like (um) I I did not go poly though I I went to check organization do you know
organization so they are actually under <malay>macam</malay> they are more they work more with community instead of (err) [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> like you are the patient [kan] ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like you just <malay>macam</malay> go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then (um) <malay>macam</malay> they will tell you [lah] or you you might need <malay>macam</malay> counselling or what then <malay>macam</malay> they will refer you to them [lah] me (err) I think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy [ah] I'm not so sure about that but then <malay>macam</malay> (um) because yesterday when they told me about the the (err) what I can do next then <malay>macam</malay> rate of like (err) what the next thing then we just counselling [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is forty dollars per session so like I think it's quite okay but
(err) I ya I went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at itself because like the doctor really didn't <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] don't really [ah] take you no cannot ya
[oh] okay sure okay

supporting [lah] ya <malay>dayah yang kena</malay> support [lah]
[ah] <malay>habis apasal</malay> taxi driver
okay
<malay>tapi dayah</malay> but [oh] my lord <malay>macam</malay> like
#dayah# is at the stage of her life that she's driven and <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of aspiration
<malay>habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia</malay> educated <malay>ke atau dia kaya ke</malay> at the end he's just going to be having this (err) aura of like <malay>macam</malay> relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
<malay>nanti tahu tahu</malay>
<malay>tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>berbual pasal ini</malay> okay <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>dia yang nanti belakang hari</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband <malay>lagi</malay> worse <malay>kalau dia</malay> have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character <malay>ke apa</malay> if he has it okay that <malay>macam</malay> he might ask #dayah# to stop working and things like that [lah]
<malay>habis</malay> so you just say that [ah]
#dayah's# [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand <malay>pasal</malay>
this whole like family who <malay>yang macam</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu benda orang orang</malay> I don't know family <malay>ke sesiapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang rasa</malay>
[oh] <malay>lebih baik</malay> (err) <malay>halalkan percepatkan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> as if <malay>macam itu ikut sunah nabi</malay> okay they take that part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage but the other part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like <malay>macam</malay> your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody <malay>yang macam</malay> that <malay>macam</malay> is complementary to like your personality
<malay>mana boleh macam</malay> like that [ah] ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack (err) <malay>macam</malay> complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see <malay>macam</malay> that is the thing that <malay>orang</malay> just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part <malay>nak kahwin cepat macam</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>ikut sunah nabi percepatkan</malay> but part part <malay>lain macam</malay>
to get somebody that is competent with you <malay>ini semua tak tak ambil kira</malay> [ah]
so fed up [ah] this type of thing
<malay>habis zina cakap zina macam mana</malay>
(uh) anyway this boy the call you <malay>abang</malay> or what
he should be comfortable with it [lah] <malay>dia ada kakak apa</malay>
I don't think he even thinks like this [lah]
[oh] so that's when he call you <malay>abang</malay> [ah]
[oh]
foresight [a'ah]
so the conversation <malay>dengan zina</malay> (err) <malay>bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar</malay> it's more of like what what did you say to <malay>zina pasal yang</malay> the growing up and then <malay>pasal pasal</malay> making a <malay>apa</malay> plan <malay>habis pasal apa lagi</malay> like what else did you address
did you say that did you say
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this [ah] <malay>kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena</malay> wake up music just just just use this card
<malay>kata nak kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu</malay> <malay>tengok sampai perempuan agaknya</malay> she will just be fed up one day <malay>tapi betul apa macam</malay>
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect <malay>macam</malay> do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
easy go easy (uh) <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> (uh) [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>itu tak ada pendirian</malay> [lah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
no <malay>macam gini</malay> the thing <malay>yang dia nak kena</malay> differentiate is <malay>ada bezanya</malay> easy-going <malay>dan tak ada haluan</malay> this is the thing #zina# you are which one
easy-going <malay>atau</malay> actually you are directionless
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
you said that [ah] <malay>untuk si ashraf ini</malay> [ah] <malay>habis ashraf cakap apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>budak ini pun tahu ke tak</malay> the background of #zina#
are you sure or not #salim# I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
so this easily two years <malay>baru</malay> meet up <malay>tahu</malay>
!haiya!
I mean I !haiya! I don't know what to feel about this
I mean yes <malay>macam</malay> I am thankful and it's nice to know <malay>budak ini budak baik</malay> (err) so like what #izat# say <malay>kau tengok</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia</malay>
ya [lah] ya <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want after this #izat# say !huh! <malay>kau tengok macam aku cakap</malay>
<malay>dia budak baik</malay> I hope #izat# doesn't go like this [lah] ya but anyway
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
ya
send ya
must take this action
<malay>sambil lewa</malay> anyway what I was saying okay
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether (uh) I
I really don't know [lah] this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes <malay>macam</malay> to
push <malay>zina tapi</malay> I don't know if at the end of this product is #zina# will be
pushed or #zina# will be pulled down
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all #zina# loses <malay>dia punya</malay> identity because this she is she is <malay>macam</malay> dissolving into a very
(err) big personality how to say not big [lah] firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
[ah] it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible <malay>lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia</malay> see that I don't know [lah] sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if <malay>macam</malay> she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that <malay>macam</malay> you know like [ah] a woman shall be like <malay>macam</malay> be led by a man that kind of thing and
your life will turn out well
[ah]
at because at some point there will be a point that <malay>macam</malay> she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
no it's not say <malay>tak lepas tangan</malay> it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself [tau] this twentieth (uh) twenty some age
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to #dayah#
<malay>tak pernah tanya dia zina tak pernah tanya</malay>
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with #izat#
!huh! you talk about marriage to #izat# like what
this was before [lah]
seriously
but #dayah# said <malay>yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang</malay> denmark <malay>itu</malay>
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff <malay>orang punya</malay> personal is to us superficial
ya but #zina# can also ask you the same then why and why you and #izat# is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and #izat# are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya [lah]
ya [lah] because also also #dayah# always clamps her down
then you <malay>tak cakap macam dengan zina</malay>
at the end of the day #zina# #dayah# is still your sister <malay>macam</malay> you know she still cares for you [lah] then you know like
maybe she you <malay>tak cakap</malay> [lah] why why didn't you say to <malay>zina tadi</malay> like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you <malay>tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu</malay>
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya [lah]
ya ya
#hidayah# is clamping her down [lah]
ya ya
then <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini</malay> mama and <malay>abah</malay> was there <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> you cannot chat <malay>ini</malay>
!huh!
my why is my recoding still (err) okay you continue <malay>kejap kejap</malay> ya my recording is kind of
[ah] [ah] [ah] where
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>habis</malay> nevermind <malay>lepas itu</malay> then she say what <malay>dia tak cakap apa-apa</malay>
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to #izat# ever since <malay>macam</malay> she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
you said that okay
okay
<malay>habis dia cakap habis dia cakap apa</malay>
and just because #izat# is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue [lah] <malay>cuba kalau</malay> the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies <malay>kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat</malay> will be supportive <malay>pasal apa</malay>
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that <malay>macam</malay> don't say that
you are <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] it's not that she will see all this point
<malay>habis</malay> if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
you said that [ah] then
<malay>habis cakap</malay> you're close to <malay>izat pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>suruh izat tolong</malay> [ah]
<malay>budak ni segan silu</malay> !wow!
ya
but that's because <malay>dia orang</malay> don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to <malay>tolong</malay> them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it [lah]
but it's hard [lah] I mean it's also vary in age age difference <malay>macam</malay> I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
it's very hard and you will often require a certain (mm)
change of life events or certain
[oh] you also cannot engineer it [what] #salim# like <malay>macam</malay> you cannot be bringing the two of them together
<malay>habis</malay> expect <malay>dia orang macam</malay> (uh) to <malay>boleh berbual</malay> like at a very deep level <malay>mana boleh</malay> like it will also feel it's so <malay>janggal macam</malay> it was so it was just feel so weird [lah]

K and K got that
you can put your earpiece back on
!yay! okay (um) [oh] my god can you imagine I <malay>cakap</malay> !yay! <malay>pula nanti dia kena</malay> transcribe <malay>lagi</malay> <malay>takpe takpe</malay> okay
so anyway (um) how has your work been
[oh] how come [ah] how come <malay>boleh</malay>
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay
how long was it [eh] the practicum
!huh! so fast
but still two and a half months pass by quite <malay>cepat</malay> actually [kan]
[oh] cause <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> you start the project [dah] start is it the project that they were doing at the place
(mm)
[oh] [eh] the area <malay>dekat dekat mana</malay> though
[oh] ya okay ya ya ya no no (err) what was I
what was I going to ask [oh] but then <malay>macam</malay> was it <malay>susah</malay> to like
suddenly
you know you you took on like new cases <malay>atau</malay> existing cases that they pass on to you <malay>gitu macam tak</malay> hard to adjust
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> short staff short staff <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] no
[oh]
[oh] I think I remember your office <malay>dekat mana dia tempat</malay> (uh) my office <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>daerah situ</malay>
(mm)
(uh) <malay>apa apa itu nak cakap</malay> (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya that that's why
ya
ya [oh] so
they offered you full time is it
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[oh] <malay>tapi padahal</malay> they
[oh]
(mm)
ya so <malay>macam</malay> your experience is good [lah] from the [oh]
and then <malay>macam</malay> environment besides environment wise <malay>macam</malay> your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] like okay like no issues
that's good that's refreshing
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>pasal dia dah biasa</malay> with what <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia dah buat</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya that's (mm) awkward
<malay>tidak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita apa itu</malay> take turns
(mm)
(mm)
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
(mm)
wait that that that's a good thing [kan] or
(mm)
(mm)
ya
are there <malay>ada</malay> interns <malay>lain</malay> or you just <malay>seorang</malay> intern like or like got other people <malay>macam</malay> doing their practicum there also
I see okay okay wait the interns usually <malay>macam</malay> fresh grads or
all <malay>macam budak</malay> masters or like <malay>budak</malay> degree <malay>macam</malay> you know same level as you
[oh] okay
or people with experience [lah] so they don't have to train so much
independent
(mm)
I see
ya
(mm) LOL
ya
ya that's true
[oh] that's a lot
that's why #siao#
(mm)
ya
[oh] so it's not <malay>macam</malay> it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
<malay>ketawa</malay> but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year <malay>atau</malay>
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
[oh] so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
[oh]
ya
ya ya ya ya I mean I feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of <malay>macam</malay>
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
<malay>macam</malay> organisations [lah]
you know <malay>ada</malay> this issue
so you're not gonna take take up their
<malay>apa itu</malay> offer so called
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] okay
ya
(mm)
it's okay keep your options open then <malay>macam</malay> explore (um) you know <malay>macam lain</malay> opportunities when do they need to hear by
(uh) okay <malay>tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam</malay> deadline for the application
[ah] okay okay
[ah]
ya <malay>faham faham</malay> totally <malay>faham</malay>
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
cause <malay>tadi bila</malay> I <malay>ketawa</malay> [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> line <malay>macam besar</malay>
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like [oh] no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
<malay>apa nak cakap</malay> (mm)
[oh] okay ya I totally understand <malay>macam</malay> the need to take a break I mean
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
(mm) make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
studying [kan] <malay>lagi berapa lama</malay> before you finish the when you finish your masters
<malay>tak</malay> necessary is it
(mm)
(mm) [ah] ya ya understand I feel like I'm there also I'm thinking <malay>macam</malay> you know I really don't mind
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
(mm) dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in (uh) you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
so <malay>macam</malay> who knows maybe if I if a a different place <malay>macam</malay> even a different job a different industry I could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) it's been good I am teaching
okay is <malay>macam</malay> zoom is surprisingly so much harder than <malay>tak</malay> zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like <malay>macam</malay> you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot <malay>macam</malay> how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so I must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like (um) when I
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
(um) switch [lah] so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like [oh] my god
and then <malay>macam</malay> the way you talk to them actually on zoom [kan] you don't command as much like authority or respect I feel so <malay>macam</malay> the tone <malay>macam</malay> they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like I need you to stop
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me [lah] cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you (um) (err) I need I'll be like (err) [oh] sit down okay or like (err)
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want [lah]
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
(mm) be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
ya I mean right now they hardly recognize me also because I'm not their regular teacher and then <malay>macam</malay> I get a bit sub [ah] subconscious a bit conscious <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> camera on so <malay>macam</malay> when my camera <malay>itu</malay> on so I <malay>boleh nampak</malay> my own videos I'm like hate this makes me very <malay>macam</malay> self-conscious <malay>gitu</malay> [lah]
so <malay>tapi bila</malay> I off (um) I am less self-conscious I can be less
(err) I can be more strict <malay>gitu tapi</malay> I tend to not because <malay>kita</malay> have to <malay>senyum</malay> for the entire lesson <malay>senyum</malay> for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau macam</malay> camera off then I will <malay>terlupa</malay> to <malay>senyum</malay> <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] ya so a lot of things to take note <malay>macam</malay>
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
<malay>tapi dia orang macam</malay> type nonsense <malay>tau macam</malay> hi hi hi hi <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> answer <malay>dia</malay> A they be like A A A A then I'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like (ugh) but then okay [lah] they are cute and I'm getting the hang of it I think <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] last week I did not teach because (um) [oh] so on thursday I injured my back
I went to the gym to the gym and then I injured my back and then <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>balik</malay>
no one week ago so ya so one week ago I <malay>tak</malay> warm up [lah] it was really stupid I forgot to warm up and then I just <malay>angkat berat</malay> then I felt like <malay>macam</malay> a sharp pain in my back then I was like [oh] no
so I thought I thought <malay>macam</malay> okay okay is it because I'm sore <malay>asal asal macam susah ini</malay> I feel like everything feels heavier and more I I feel like everything was sore I thought okay maybe
you know my period's coming
[tau] like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
be <malay>sakit</malay> [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> I really messed up like !aiya! something is wrong [lah] this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back <malay>tapi</malay> I continue whatever I can but <malay>lepas</malay> I <malay>balik</malay> I had a class [lah] and then during the class I told them I will be <malay>lambat sikit</malay> because
I am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour <malay>macam</malay> this slow then I I drop my soap and I couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay> so when I joined the class they were very understanding sorry I joined the class usually <malay>kita</malay> will <malay>jumpa</malay> about half an hour before the kids come in so I came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in [lah] so it's still okay
and then <malay>macam</malay> (um) I told them about it and then eventually I think after the class she told my (um) how to say my not my supervisor [lah] she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday <malay>tak payah</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
<malay>jadi</malay> on saturday she told me (uh) <malay>tak payah kerja</malay> because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also I was supposed to go to the gym cause I had a training
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak pergi</malay> cause my back <malay>sakit</malay> so I was like okay [lah] okay [lah]
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came (uh) okay [lah] like out of the six of us only like four people [eh] two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
ya <malay>tapi</malay>
ya then after that I thought okay just rest [lah] <malay>macam</malay> take this opportunity to rest so I rest <malay>tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay> it hurts when I sneeze so I thought !alamak! <malay>ini macam</malay> not <malay>macam bukan tak</malay> normal [kan] ya
ya so I told my coach <malay>semalam yang</malay> it hurts when I sneeze so she said (mm) she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so I started to panic and then she was like [oh] maybe you should go <malay>sebab kalau pergi</malay> the only thing a will do is give painkillers
so she was like I think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an or something so I was like <malay>tak nak</malay> so she was like okay [lah] then <malay>macam tengok</malay> chiro or like (uh) get a sports massage [lah] so I tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like <malay>bekam</malay>
and sports massage cause I read like <malay>bekam</malay> can help with like nerve <malay>macam</malay> you know what if your nerve <malay>macam</malay> (err) nerve pinching I feel like sometimes you <malay>macam</malay> you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so <malay>macam</malay> it's apparently <malay>bekam</malay> can help with that and <malay>macam</malay>
ya <malay>bekam</malay> can help you with that I <malay>takut</malay> <malay>sakit tak</malay> have you tried it before
[oh] did she say if <malay>tak sakit</malay> [eh]
(mm)
(uh) yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
(mm) you free [kan] <malay>dekat</malay> #gambas# that's where my other gym is
there's
(uh) <malay>dekat</malay> #sembawang# there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east I think my the coach that (um) has is qualified to do like the massage and the <malay>bekam</malay> is <malay>dekat</malay> will be at the #gambas# one on monday
(err) she asked me if I can make it at two thirty then after that she <malay>belum</malay> reply I so I <malay>tak tahu belum</malay> confirm [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
I'm hoping that !aiya! I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
<malay>itu pasal</malay> she haven't reply so I said okay how long is the session and how much is it so <malay>macam</malay>
so no reply but I read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then <malay>macam</malay> what she will do depends on your condition so <malay>macam</malay> either I mean you can ask for her to <malay>bekam</malay> [lah] if you that's what you want <malay>macam mana</malay> otherwise she will (uh) base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a <malay>bekam</malay> or like some mobility work [ah]
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> I think she <malay>buat bekam angin</malay> if I'm not wrong cause I think I saw a video of her doing <malay>bekam</malay> on instagram can send you
no it looks like the <malay>angin</malay> one like <malay>ada macam</malay> after she put the cup like she pull something (mm) then the thing <malay>macam</malay> suction
go for the <malay>darah</malay> one
(mm)
[oh] so the <malay>dia macam</malay> slightly different how to say
(err) like <malay>bekam angin</malay> versus <malay>bekam darah macam</malay> target slightly different things [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] okay
[oh]
I see okay good that I
don't then
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>dekat rumah dia</malay> is it
[oh] then hers is how much
[oh] I <malay>ada macam</malay> hundred around there standard right that's like standardish I guess
(mm)
(mm)
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby [kan]
(um) like consultation <malay>dia sahaja dah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> ya she she's a private doctor [lah] so very <malay>mahal</malay> like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation <malay>sahaja</malay> hundred plus then <malay>macam</malay> if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
ya so I'm thinking about I'm thinking massage <malay>atau bekam dulu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>kalau</malay> it's not like
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
no [ah] <malay>abeh sekarang sekarang</malay> my <malay>kaki sakit dah</malay> [lah] <malay>belakang sakit kaki sakit</malay> because I <malay>pergi</malay> gym
for training yesterday [kan] then (uh) certain things #aqilah# [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> you know she
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things I mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know <malay>macam</malay> I feel like my ego I have like <malay>macam</malay> like it's frustrating [lah]
like all the progress I've made gone so <malay>macam</malay> the the weight the weight the group that I was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and I was like thirty kilos
I was struggling because <malay>macam nak angkat sahaja sakit</malay> then the moment I felt like that stabbing pain I'll just like I scared [lah] so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya so she also like told me to just
ya and then <malay>tapi semalam ada sekarang</malay> my <malay>kaki sakit</malay> because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so <malay>macam</malay> like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so <malay>macam</malay>
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
[oh] really [ah] tuesday I still have like (um) today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus I'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more <malay>sakit</malay> then I'll let you know
I mean it it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after <malay>bekam</malay> there's no like rule to not do any physical activity [kan] I mean <malay>kita jalan sahaja</malay>
so <malay>kalau kita</malay> I mean <malay>kita</malay> hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good I think for like you know aches and pains
[oh] my god my laughter is so cringe <malay>nanti orang</malay> transcribe
(mm)
[oh] that is so
[oh] my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
<malay>macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti</malay> all the haha hehes that <malay>kena</malay> transcribe I I cannot transcribe my own voice also [lah] can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
you know
it's just like (ugh) gross
way lower than you thought
[oh]
(mm) and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high (mm)
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something (uh)
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think #inhan# sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now is any super heavily actually near my house
[oh] mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me [lah] I mean like you heard you heard my okay okay
(mm)
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that [lah] it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not [kan] so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans [oh] chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
(err) ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just (ugh) celebrity
I guess
is it (mm) I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
[oh] anyway <malay>apa itu</malay> so
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
have you seen the list (uh) list <malay>pula</malay> have you seen the website <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>hantar</malay>
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
I don't know [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the jinx <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
I mean <malay>mana-mana pun ada</malay> so it's me [lah]
ya but most of them are so far for you I think hillview is like the how to say <malay>dekat situ ada banyak</malay> trails I feel cause that's the nature reserve area
(mm)
your areas <malay>ada ke</malay> other trails macritchie is it wait no #sembawang# area
[oh]
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well I can't cycle and now I just announced it <malay>apa nak cakap</malay> [eh] okay we can look at more sites [lah] think got more options <malay>tapi yang yang</malay> at the the one I sent you to (mm) <malay>kita ada</malay> the lower pierce reservoir park
(mm) #ang mo kio# park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
and then there's the #sungei buloh# wetland reserve need <malay>ini dekat mana</malay> [eh] #kranji# hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
(mm) ya and then there's
dairy farm nature park
[oh] this one got stairs don't want <malay>malas</malay> they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
and this one quite
[oh] eco green
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
like would it be very is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know #afiqah# #afiqah# you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
she is married and I think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time <malay>ingat tak yang kita pergi makan</malay>
[eh] were you staying at our table
<malay>yang kita makan</malay> #mukshidonna# [oh] ya so she was talking about that
(mm)
she got married (uh) I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite (um) because like (err)
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
(um) they only allow like ten people
(mm) and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it [lah] like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
(mm) I don't think so
[oh] is the is the one that her long term the one that always [eh] ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
(mm)
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
(mm)
not officially <malay>tapi</malay> like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home I thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice [lah] he just seems <malay>macam</malay> very shy a bit <malay>macam</malay> shy [lah] I mean like a group of girls then <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>kecoh</malay> so I think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
ya and very <malay>macam</malay> considering he's quite young he's very <malay>macam</malay> independentish <malay>macam</malay> financially independent like ya like matured [lah] matured
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
(um)
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
because (err) I assume her house I mean her house is big [kan] so I think and her room is big so I think <malay>macam</malay> he moved in with her [lah]
(mm) makes more sense
and <malay>padahal</malay> and I think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house <malay>tapi macam</malay> is easier <malay>pakai tudung leceh</malay> you know if you were like
I mean brother then okay [lah] I don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing <malay>tudung</malay>
[oh]
ya ya ya I feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because <malay>macam</malay> how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes [lah] like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then <malay>macam</malay> if the wife is also like a
I don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya I get what you mean <malay>tapi macam</malay> less of an issue <malay>kalau</malay> if the guy moves into the house cause he
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working [ah] then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
(mm)
[oh] like the dad is more chill [lah] usually
(uh) ya that's true I feel like <malay>macam</malay> there's that expectation [lah] double standards a bit ya
and also like it's a culture thing also [lah] like [oh] you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
not working ya because like [oh] <malay>perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja</malay> you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
especially <malay>macam</malay> your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so <malay>macam</malay> if you come back after a few years then you're like (uh) you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care [kan] then it it might fall to the parents that's not fair so <malay>macam</malay> if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where <malay>macam dah besar sikit</malay> then at least school age school going age you know
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time [lah] to like (uh) you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
<malay>siapa</malay> [lah]
[oh] was it with his girlfriend also
serious [oh] is it because of his surprise birthday party (uh)
so what have you decided
[eh] how do you get her number [ah] I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
!wah! your friend is so going to feel betrayed [sia]
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
where there's me then <malay>baru ada</malay>
so [dah] decide
(hmm) [dah] <malay>macam</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay> project
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
(hmm) <malay>tak suka</malay>
[orh]
but you think he okay or not
serious [ah]
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I <malay>suka</malay> especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza [lah]
(mm)
tourist stuff <malay>dekat</malay> #Sentosa#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever [lah]
wait but you [dah] <malay>beli belum dia punya</malay> ticket
<malay>cari</malay> online [ah] I think <malay>ada yang ada</malay> twenty five per cent off [eh]
[oh]
okay
[oh] forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
[oh] that's good deal man
[eh] can you share the link with me
it's not so much the beach [lah] because you all are going to <malay>macam tempat tempat</malay> the attraction right
(mm)
that's at Marina Bay <malay>punya tempat</malay>
you know the one <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> Marina Barrage <malay>itu hari</malay> [oh] because you took #Jihan# <malay>punya</malay> car (um)
before you <malay>sampai</malay> Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
<malay>ada</malay> air-con <malay>tak</malay>
!alah!
!alah! are you going <malay>malam</malay> or <malay>pagi</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
[oh] and fly kite
[oh]
can you please buy a good kite
[oh] ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right <malay>tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> your own is
[oh] <malay>tak de</malay> tentage [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau nak</malay> tentage you can take mine
I don't know
[oh] but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
[orh] ya [lah] I mean is at one corner [lah] if that's what you want <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak orang tak kacau</malay> then okay [lah]
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter [lah] that had shade
ours was quite open <malay>dia</malay> exposed [ah] so
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
(uh) given the circumstances I think that's not bad [lah] but I think I saw some of them <malay>duduk dekat</malay> nearer to the lift area that one <malay>tak kena panas sangat</malay>
what time you intend to go [ah] that's the point
(mm)
actually that day
<malay>kalau bawa</malay>
(mm)
but <malay>pernah tak</malay>
ya <malay>kalau tak pernah</malay> then better don't
#Seah Im# <malay>kat luar</malay> [lah] park <malay>kat luar</malay>
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him <malay>jangan bawa</malay> <malay>motosikal</malay> because if he doesn't bring his bike then <malay>dia rasa macam</malay>
<malay>asal</malay> [eh] normally we ya
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know !fuh!
but <malay>muka</malay> girlfriend <malay>dia muka</malay> poker face <malay>tak</malay> is it she can [ah]
okay actually to me [lah] is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like #Razi# did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places [ah] then what happen [ah]
[oh] he will [ah] okay okay (um) because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
[oh] okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
following each other's plan can but <malay>kalau</malay> the partner like me like that last minute say don't want [ah] I want today I got I got cramp [ah] I decide not to go to #Sentosa# then <malay>habis</malay>
gone
but ya that's very nice [lah] of the girlfriend
(mm)
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
because marina barrage <malay>dia punya</malay> <malay>jauh</malay> [tau]
Marina Bay (uh) Marina Marina Bay [lah] [kan]
Barrage if you got no car you go #Sentosa#
because because #Sentosa# <malay>tak ada kereta senang</malay> that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
[oh] because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay [lah]
[oh] okay then Marina Barrage makes sense [lah]
yes yes yes
(mm)
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have #meriahness# if there is
I mean !aiya! for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
I seriously think that's a good idea too because #Sentosa# <malay>nak keluar pun leceh</malay>
ya ya actually it's true [lah] I I mean no I personally don't like #Sentosa#
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for #Sentosa#
<malay>apa</malay>
earlier [lah]
[oh] it's a weekend [ah]
[ah]
okay
[oh] ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
[orh]
cable car then <malay>yang</malay> Carlsberg <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>yang pusing pusing</malay> the thing that <malay>pusing</malay>
then <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>yang lima</malay>
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before [lah] in Singapore
I went I don't think I've been to the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> Singapore
Hong Kong I went to #Bangkok# <malay>tak salah</malay> [eh] with my husband once
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
[ah] okay
but ya you share with me [ah] I also want to see [eh] since my staycation [dah] <malay>kena</malay> cancel [kan] so
[ah]
ya then you make him <malay>jalan</malay> also
but I'm pretty sure <malay>dia penat</malay> from going for <malay>kelas mengaji</malay> okay that's wrong but
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
<malay>dia kat mana dia dekat</malay> <malay> bukan #Tampines#
the birthday boy is gonna be from
#Tampines#
not the other side of the Singapore right
[ah]
because <malay>kalau daripada</malay> #Tampines# actually it's a bit more difficult [lah] <malay>dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang</malay> [kan]
[ah] okay
I see [oh] it's not like she go and <malay>jumpa</malay> him somewhere and then they
wait where she stay again
near my house
[ah] near my friend's place okay okay okay
yeah <malay>ni macam</malay> papa [lah]

because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
(uh) I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow [lah] !huh!
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because <malay>susah</malay> you really have to <malay>macam tak de</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> secrets out
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people [lah] so I always leave it to other people
[oh] ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like [ah]
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better [ah]
food
<malay>berapa orang</malay> [sia]
for eleven that's <malay>mahal</malay> [leh]
okay all growing boys
ya but to me (mm) okay [lah] for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
[oh] okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
(mm) then what she say
[oh] my god
(uh) then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
(uh) #mee# tom yum (mm) one of them
(um) <malay>nasi goreng</malay> tom yum
<malay>kat mana</malay>
you have to see you know whether you have to make [oh] but because it's a hawker centre <malay>tak yah buat</malay> reservation [ah]
no because now
[ah]
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
<malay>habis</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>kalau</malay>
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
<malay>korang bawa makanan tak gi sana</malay>
potluck [ah] <malay>macam</malay> picnic style [ah]
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason [lah] [eh] let's say
ya if satay by the bay let's say <malay>penuh nak</malay> #mams# [kan] then you find in that area <malay>apa lagi kedai makan [ah]</malay>

[oh]
ya [lah]
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say [ah]
[oh] but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant [lah] but okay [lah] I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
(mm)
but they make you feel included [lah]
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that #Shiqah# #Ad# #Razi# group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean #Aidil# they all but I rarely get to meet him [lah] but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends [sia] [oh] and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
[ah]
ya that one we got no other [eh] unless you want to bring the the <malay>bapa</malay> and the <malay>anak</malay> and the
but I think two person is much more better [leh] I feel [lah]
don't know [lah] I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
!aiya! but they going week weekend [ah]
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
that time [ah] I see my friend <malay>pergi</malay>
like (err) <malay>kosong</malay> the whole you know where the
the one that they always do (uh) free dance <malay>dia macam</malay> dance on the road <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> the road [ah]
that one <malay>dia pergi kosong</malay> [lah]
[oh] ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me <malay>dia orang kena buang kerja</malay>
I don't know how you can recognise such faces [seh]
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
[ah] no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary [ah]
try [ah]
cannot [ah]
don't know I don't know you pay me also <malay>belum tentu</malay> I <malay>naik</malay>
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
like you know the restaurant <malay>yang</malay> no the restaurant <malay>yang ada kereta kereta tu</malay> [lah] the vintage car
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
cannot cannot be I <malay>tak kerja</malay> right I think <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja kot</malay>
I went there share I went with who [ah] I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
was it was it <malay>berapa bulan</malay> [ah]
early part [eh]
[oh] I <malay>belum pakai tudung</malay> so that means yeah ya ya I <malay>belum pakai tudung</malay> so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
[oh] crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
first trimester is supposed to be like (uh) they say what <malay>belum melekat</malay> yet
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay [what]
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared [sia]
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
the flower one [dah] <malay>habis</malay>
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
<malay>rezeki</malay> don't <malay>tolak</malay>
yes
<malay>rezeki</malay> [dah] <malay>ketuk kat pintu</malay> knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
[orh] <malay>dia tak kaku dia tak</malay> awkward [lah]
how
wait <malay>dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah</malay>
what
[oh] my god okay
[oh]
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
[oh] so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
<malay>lurus bendul</malay> [lah] that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
opinion
not <malay>lurus bendul</malay> I think <malay>dia tak</malay> nonsense [ah]
(uh) <malay>lurus</malay>
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
and that's the reason why <malay>dia kena</malay> avoid <malay>orang orang yang macam</malay> hypocrite
because if he doesn't hide
[ah] he will say
a bit [meh]
a bit [meh] <malay>panas baran</malay>
no no this this is what that <malay>darah muda</malay>
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be #Aidil# [lah] up till now
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know [dah] <malay>besar anak mak</malay>
actually actually is true [eh]
once <malay>dia masuk</malay> primary school [ah]
and then his mum will be left
!aww!
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
[oh] I don't tell her so that (uh) she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who [ah]
[ah] I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
you bloom into a <malay>minah</malay> or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
path you wanna take [ah] I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
yeah I took a nerd path come on then <malay>balik lambat</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay <malay>balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan</malay>
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
<malay>bila</malay> [sia] the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I remember
I <malay>jumpa kat</malay> #Tampines# mart
you know the McDonald's <malay>punya</malay> carpark <malay>masuk</malay> right ya ya ya ya
#Kartini# will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come <malay>jalan</malay>
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then [ah] whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already [lah] this one
not like <malay>macam</malay> accident every day also like that that one not accident already
then (uh) I remember [lah] the one in my secondary school is this
(um) very strict indian discipline guy you know
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he <malay>sengaja</malay> he never
we were like
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he <malay>tutup</malay>
then we run to the main gate <malay>masuk</malay>
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
[oh] ya we we I tell you we are nerds [what] we can spend in library from nine [eh] nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
(um) was I like that for secondary school

ya so I was a geek [lah] we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we even have a <malay>apa</malay>
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay (uh)
[oh] in the morning when you come then you ask each other [eh]
[dah] <malay>buat</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> (uh) okay for example there's
geography [lah] geography maths science okay
[dah] <malay>buat</malay> maths [dah] <malay>buat</malay> science [dah] <malay>buat</malay> geography <malay>belum</malay>
art you [dah] okay and then the other person [oh] <malay>aku belum buat ni</malay> okay okay okay okay (uh) it when is your class we copy later then we do rotation [ah]
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
okay finish now <malay>siapa nak</malay> [dah] <malay>habis siapa nak</malay>
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater !huh!
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level [ah]
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
(uh) <malay>apa dorang panggil</malay>
[ah]
[ah] because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
(uh) yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
[oh] sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
(uh) arts (uh) sports and
(uh) I don't know geek [lah] I would categorise (uh) debate as geek [lah] I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood [lah] it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek [lah] okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool [lah] debater [oh] I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I represented
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why [eh] I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game (um) minefield
so basically <malay>kat batu dorang buat macam</malay> it's something like chess [ah] <malay>dorang buat ni</malay> yeah
[eh] that one is I tell you [ah]
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject [lah]
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch [oh]
like how curious a a kid is [oh] why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the [oh] so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I [oh] the only reason why I went for that course was because [ah] [ah] ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
(uh) who (err) so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late (uh) we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up [lah] basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he didn't allow us to go in <malay>tutup</malay>
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
[ah]
[eh] come on [lah] I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
let's go <malay>cabut cabut</malay> come let's
<malay>cabut</malay> I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
the first guy said <malay>naik naik naik naik</malay> we went out
he [hor] we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say [eh] you know [ah]
actually the head prefect saw my face already [ah] just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl [ah]
<malay>maju</malay> [lah] she she's
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class [lah]
[eh] so and so so and so saw my face already know !wah! if he see that I disappear already [ah] sure he will mark me [one]
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school [lah] [sia]
(uh) ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time [lah] since [dah] <malay>kena</malay> marked also right we
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
I think second last day ya then we walk okay [ah] <malay>kena buat</malay> detention first time in my life [ah] <malay>kena</malay> detention know then I was like
!walao! [eh] this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention [lah]
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually (uh) supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself [lah]
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no [lah] of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
[oh]
[a'ah]
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
[oh] my god
[oh] but the discipline master doesn't know you personally [ah]
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so #pai kia# [ah]
all cannot make it [sia]
[ah]
!huh!
[eh] actually primary school classes are the worst to manage [ah]
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths [ah] okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health [lah] <malay>kesian budak ni</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila bila</malay>
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that [one] especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun [lah] they are innocent [ah] so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can [ah] if ya

<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay> camper van <malay>berlubang</malay>
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay [lah] tasmania best [lah] <malay>sebab dapat naik</malay> the ocean liner [kan] travel from melbourne to tasmania <malay>tapi</malay>
(um) sydney <malay>dengan</malay> sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family <malay>yang</malay> follow <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> best [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you enjoy more with them
there are shared memories together [ah]
[oh] berry van [eh]
ya <malay>lepas tu yang kita</malay> you <malay>makan kat</malay> perfect catch
<malay>tu pun</malay> best [ah] fish and chips by the river power [sia]
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to <malay>punya</malay> fish and chips fish and chips
<malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak sedap</malay>
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
ya I went to new zealand <malay>dengan</malay> my aunties [lah] and my cousins
(err) well (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>pergi dengan</malay> (um) <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang punya</malay> level of (err) worry is more because they feel that they are responsible [lah] for you
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
I <malay>tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> you <malay>dah dengan makcik-makcik</malay> I
(err) <malay>dia orang dah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah]
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
<malay>dia dah pergi</malay> counter <malay>dah pergi bayar</malay>
<malay>alih-alih</malay> he was walking on the platform
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
it must be ticked are you fit <malay>ada sakit apa-apa tak</malay> you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera <malay>benda-benda macam gini semua biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> fill
and once you are done ya [lah] I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
so they give you a cert [lah] to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and #nah# <malay>ambil kau punya</malay> cert
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that I went
so <malay>kita dalam kat</malay> new zealand maybe about one or two
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
my cousin and <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub
<malay>tak tak minum</malay> [ah] [eh] [ah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub ordered hot chocolate
<malay>kita pergi</malay> pub <malay>pergi</malay> pub (err) hot chocolate <malay>tengok bola kat luar</malay>
<malay>tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan</malay> it was raining
(um) and then <malay>bila esok pagi</malay>
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> (um) snow fell
<malay>lepas tu bila</malay> when there was snow (err) we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
(um) the advisory was <malay>tak boleh</malay> drive on the road <malay>dulu</malay>
and then (um) apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow <malay>yang</malay> christchurch (um) felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so <malay>macam lama gila</malay> [ah] <malay>lama tak boleh</malay> snow <malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err)
[eh] did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time I felt snow
ya <malay>betul</malay> I think that was the first time I <malay>rasa</malay> snow
(err) unique experience [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> snow [kan] so
ya ya ya we <malay>memang kita tahu</malay> it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves [lah]
(err)
(err) not for snow but I mean just winter <malay>kita tak tahu pun</malay> there was snow that was gonna happen
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch <malay>maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana</malay>
the tour company decided okay nevermind we (err) board the bus and <malay>lepas tu</malay> drove to another hotel
and (um) ya we basically <malay>tidur kat</malay> hotel <malay>baru</malay>
<malay>tapi yang tak</malay> #bestnya# <malay>pasal</malay> new zealand
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine [eh]
(um) winter obvious <malay>sejuk lepas tu</malay>
winter <malay>sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis</malay>
<malay>semua benda semua kedai dah tutup</malay> then so it was quite boring [lah] for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that !wow! at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but <malay>tengok</malay> so it was kind of boring [ah] but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night <malay>ke</malay> two extra night
ya
K [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
so hot chocolate [ah] <malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>tu bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> some pumpkin spice [kan]
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
<malay>dekat</malay> queen victoria market [kan]
[ah] [eh] <malay>tu biasa pasal kita terus makan</malay> donut <malay>dia kat luar</malay>
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
!wah! camper van experience <malay>lain</malay> [eh] I think
<malay>kat mana</malay>
wilsons promontory
<malay>betul</malay>
dapat
(mm) ya [lah] I think by then <malay>kita orang macam dah penat</malay> I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then (uh) by the time nightfall <malay>kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan</malay> until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal [lah] having wildlife a wombat <malay>benda yang</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak kat</malay> singapore <malay>tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk</malay> camper van
<malay>melampau</malay> [jer]
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya <malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah]
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
<malay>kita tak akan dapat</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda macam ini sebab</malay> tours chances are
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
ya and I think (um) partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> your time is yours
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I think <malay>yang</malay> even on that trip [lah] <malay>yang</malay> we <malay>kita turun tengok</malay> the river delta [kan] ya
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak tak sabar tunggu ni</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination [lah] I'm don't even wanna go
I just gonna shoot straight for
ya <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
<malay>jadi kita kasih</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang nak</malay> fly fly <malay>dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi</malay>
<malay>kita pergi apa yang kita mampu</malay> [jer] <malay>iaitu</malay> K
<malay>apa</malay>
wanna drive all the way (um)
ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay so there are two ways to go about doing it <malay>biasa orang</malay> drive
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
<malay>lepas tu tidur</malay> rest one night and then <malay>esok pagi</malay> just <malay>sambung pergi</malay> border of thailand
ya that one more relax [ah] <malay>takde kelam kabut takde macam</malay> rushing for time
<malay>kalau nak lagi rilek</malay>
drive <malay>ke</malay> <malay>tidur semalam</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> #penang#
<malay>nanti</malay> [lah] <malay>belum buka</malay> <malay>tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar</malay>
#selangor# <malay>tengah</malay> highest for COVID numbers
ya so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu lepas dah tidur</malay> <malay>satu malam pergi</malay> #penang# <malay>satu malam baru pergi</malay> thailand <malay>tapi tu dah kira dua hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau nak cepat</malay> then <malay>tidur</malay> #penang# <malay>satu hari esok kita pergi</malay> thailand <malay>ataupun lagi nak cepat terus</malay> to thailand [ah] <malay>tapi penat</malay> [ah] <malay>badan sebab</malay> it will probably be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>empat belas jam</malay> on the road [ah] so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired [ah]
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand <malay>kalau</malay> the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
<malay>sewa kereta kat sana</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> travel around southern thailand
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(err) I don't know [ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay> try <malay>tapi jangan bawa kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>jangan bawa kereta</malay> in
you <malay>sewa kereta dekat</malay> thailand
ya
<malay>kalau bawa kereta sendiri</malay> then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring [lah] so what I want is <malay>kita</malay> save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore [ah]
<malay>naik kapal terbang nak sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>kapal terbang</malay> [ah] <malay>naik</malay> [ah] <malay>kapal terbang</malay>
ya
true but then I felt that okay [lah] I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>memang</malay> best [lah] <malay>tak cakap tak</malay> best <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] bruny boring [lah] <malay>kirakan macam</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> kecil <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>tu juga</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> bunker [lah] cabin [lah]
cabin cabin
ya
okay [lah] <malay>tapi malam</malay> we <malay>kita tak</malay> travel <malay>malam</malay> so you were travelling at
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] I guess when it got
I mean <malay>bila kita baru-baru masuk</malay> when the boat started to sail
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
by the time <malay>kita dah tertidur</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled [lah] [kan] when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and <malay>dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat</malay> [lah]
then <malay>bila pagi dah bangun</malay>
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
<malay>tak</malay>
ya I think supermarkets overseas [ah]
<malay>lain</malay> okay [lah] I mean <malay>dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi</malay> I think because of the space that they have
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
and <malay>harga tak</malay> so <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
ya because they are fresh produced [ah] <malay>benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap</malay>
<malay>lagipun bila kita kat sana</malay>
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
<malay>memang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] since
[oh] <malay>dapat dia orang yang</malay> burger <malay>ni macam</malay> best [ah]
true
even the ice cream is different
okay <malay>sabar</malay> which one do you prefer you <malay>lagi suka</malay> van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>ke</malay> you <malay>lagi suka</malay> gelato #messina#
van diemen's was ya <malay>betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah</malay> farm
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] gelato #messina# <malay>ada macam-macam</malay> flavour
<malay>tapi yang</malay> #amorino# <malay>punya</malay>
#amorino# <malay>punya</malay> I think <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>kejap</malay> I <malay>tak ingat</malay> whether that one were trip <malay>ke</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak salah tu</malay> [ah]
okay
ya I like #messina# better <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
ya <malay>tu yang</malay> best <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> you you compare van diemen's van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> flavours are
much more predictable in that sense
it's not anything out of the ordinary [lah] <malay>macam</malay> K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
[kan] <malay>atau</malay>
K [lah] apple cranberry <malay>pun boleh katakan</malay>
quite common
<malay>ada apa yang dekat tu dekat</malay> tom's palette
<malay>dia tak ada ke</malay>
okay tom's palette <malay>ke</malay> gelato #messina#
ya <malay>ke</malay>
but then tom's palette <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
<malay>tapi</malay> it could also be the fact that
<malay>benda tu kita tak pernah</malay> try [ah] <malay>contoh</malay> [eh] <malay>contoh</malay>
when we went to <malay>borong</malay> market alright K break your head right
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
I I wouldn't say that <malay>sebab dulu</malay> dunkin donut <malay>pernah ada</malay> with their bavarian cream
<malay>tapi</malay> the the ones that dunkin donut <malay>jual tak sesedap</malay> [ah]
and
ya okay so <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine [ah] break your head you <malay>punya</malay> donut the dough is soft
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
<malay>inti dia penuh</malay> [kan]
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
which I am inclined to agree <malay>sebab</malay> about I haven't tasted
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
<malay>tak pada</malay> I <malay>macam lebih pada</malay> okay like
I felt that it was a cross between <malay>lemak cili padi dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> thai green curry
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>iras-iras dia</malay>
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
I think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that I thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) I wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
<malay>beutl betul betul</malay>
<malay>dah dah lepas tu</malay> I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den [ah] dragon's den dragon's den is this (uh) british show
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
investors <malay>yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak</malay> shark tank [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shark tank [ah]
so dragon's den <malay>dengan</malay> shark tank <malay>lebih kurang</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay> [ah]
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not [ah] but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted <malay>kirakan</malay> you <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but I really good are really really good
ya okay think about it [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> you miss the food overseas
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
no [lah] just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay [lah] when travel <malay>kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak</malay> most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam makan kat</malay> noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
right like like <malay>mi dengan</malay>
ya so if you were to think about it again <malay>macam</malay> is it really that fantastic
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>faham tak</malay>
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
ya it's the spices <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> okay imagine nandos
K imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
so nandos [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam</malay> up <malay>sikit</malay>
[kan] <malay>ada sudu garfu</malay>
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because I think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
that thick milkshake <malay>sedap gila</malay>
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
<malay>tak boleh</malay> replicate [ah] [eh] so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop <malay>kita masuk</malay>
K [ah] <malay>penat saje nak duduk</malay>
and baam <malay>sedap gila apa tempat ni</malay>
ya
that's true
<malay>betul juga</malay> okay [lah] maybe I think [oh] what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] factory outlets
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> bicester village elite [ah] up [ah]
bicester <malay>ke</malay> #bister#
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester [eh]
B I C E S T E R bicester
ya but I think the york <malay>punya</malay> outlets (err) better [ah]
york <malay>yang kita punya kita punya</malay> camper van (um) battery <malay>mati</malay>
yes
<malay>tak yang</malay> job <malay>dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay>
somewhere near the south
so <malay>kita</malay> travel all the way up <malay>untuk pergi</malay> york
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
that's true [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> travel <malay>untuk</malay> two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
<malay>kau orang biar betul</malay>
okay [lah]

malaysia nature
okay [lah] I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia

so <malay>walaupun masuk hutan</malay> (err) I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
<malay>tapi bila kat dalam panas juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab takde angin</malay> [ah]

four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have (err)
two thousand let me recall [ah] when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven

specifically we went to madrid [lah]
(err) at that time two thousand eight <malay>tak salah tengah</malay> euro euro two thousand eight ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah] euro two thousand eight [lah]
so (err) I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
(mm) ya
ya <malay>kalau kalau</malay> travel as a student
(um) I think you really have to plan
how much you are going to spend so <malay>macam</malay> for us while <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> we either just took the
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
<malay>atau kita ambil</malay> (um) <malay>kita ambil apa</malay> the the budget flight [ah]
so I remember there was one (um)
so we were from netherlands <malay>kita</malay> travel to belgium via bus
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
<malay>kita dah terlepas</malay> the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
<malay>jauh</malay> I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium [lah] <malay>mana</malay> belgium is germany
so <malay>kita terlepas</malay> so <malay>konon-konon nak naik</malay> taxi [ah] the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks [ah] ya
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
<malay>tak juga</malay> [ah] we were winging it [lah]
ya
[ah] ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kita cakap dengan pakcik ni</malay> [ah] driver we need to get to this airport so <malay>dia kata</malay> that sixty kilometres away
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
at least <malay>macam</malay>
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
so you <malay>macam dah</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] but the worst part is that we will we had no money [ah] there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
this was the start [lah] almost the start I think ya
no <malay>bukan takde duit</malay> [lah] but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means <malay>untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita</malay> hundred and this one [ah] more than hundred twenty euro <malay>habis kita dah duit dah sikit</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and <malay>nanti</malay> I will show you all
<malay>dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [lah]
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
ya [lah] I I think <malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam benda ini juga</malay> so <malay>dia</malay> on
<malay>dia</malay> on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter <malay>dah naik</malay> two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he said
ya and then <malay>dia kata</malay> okay you look [ah] at the meter
<malay>sekarang dah</malay> hundred three hundred and twenty euro <malay>aku</malay> off K <malay>aku</malay> off
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
<malay>lepak hidup</malay>
ya starting <malay>tu dah</malay> adventure [ah]
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
no but I think <malay>kalau</malay> spain <malay>kalah</malay> confirm <malay>raih</malay> [ah]
[ah] but because spain won (err) I think I think through penalties [eh] spain <malay>menang</malay> italy and then [ah] because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the (um) there was a big screen <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) live telecast
so <malay>kita ramai-ramai</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana sama tengok</malay> live telecast [lah]
ya and (uh) I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
the trains <malay>tutup</malay> [sia]
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
<malay>jalan</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>jalan</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid [ah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid so madrid <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> portugal so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
so it was netherlands <malay>lepas tu ambil</malay> bus <malay>pergi</malay> belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal <malay>pergi</malay> (um) flight to madrid
ya that was that was an
all the way <malay>makan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dengan</malay> tuna [ah]
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] everyday but basically living frugally [ah]
[oh] I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
<malay>kita</malay>
(um) my friend and I [lah] <malay>kita dah dah dah lapar</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita turun kat kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni kita kebetulan</malay> found a muslim shop which was nearby
no
you go through your hostel dot com <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah]
ya
so (um) <malay>jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>semua</malay> muslim brother <malay>dah masuk kedai dia</malay> apparently <malay>kita ternampak ada</malay> #prata# [ah]
#prata# [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so I don't know whether it was [ah] an instant #prata# or #prata# that they made [ah] <malay>tapi nampak macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so my friend and I [eh] <malay>baik</malay> [ah] this <malay>harapan</malay> #prata# <malay>puas hati</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tu kita dah tengah lapar</malay> so <malay>kita minta dia enam</malay> [ah] <malay>enam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tiga aku tiga</malay> [lah] <malay>enam</malay>
<malay>itu tak perasan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] and <malay>harga dia harga tak mahal sangat</malay> [lah]
true <malay>dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita dah</malay> okay [ah] <malay>enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar</malay> and he couldn't speak english
so
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu</malay>
then <malay>macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar</malay>
no
apparently <malay>dia orang makan</malay> order #prata# <malay>dengan macam sirap ke gula</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali manis nak mampus</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> I think they <malay>tuang</malay> the sugar on top [ah]
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so <malay>kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik</malay>
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ni dia ni kira macam</malay> muslim brother <malay>boleh pakai punya</malay> [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
and then (uh) you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita <malay>keluar</malay> (um) maybe like after one or after the two
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four <malay>ke</malay> two to five [ah]
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
so it's okay [lah] as in <malay>dia orang tutup sekejap</malay> for them to rest <malay>lepas tu dia orang buka sampai</malay> maybe <malay>sepuluh sebelas</malay>
ya
[ah] yup
true
[oh] (err) in madrid <malay>juga</malay> I where where when we were walking [ah] <malay>masih masih masih</malay>
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> there was this bangladeshi guy
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
<malay>kita dah kat</malay> madrid [eh] <malay>dia orang bual bual melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>muka</malay> bangladesh <malay>berbual melayu lepak</malay>
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
<malay>ada pernah kerja kat</malay> malaysia
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
I mean if the opportunity presents itself <malay>nak</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>kalau ada kerja yang bagus</malay> okay [ah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that I felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when I were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
[ah] <malay>lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana</malay> I mean
<malay>kalau kita kat</malay> singapore <malay>kalau bulan puasa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>

to like (err) online exams no no I'm I'm like not a huge fan of all this online stuff at all I hate it I really really hate it
really I cannot I feel like (um) like like very unproductive it's like (err) no no is is (err) don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really <malay>malas</malay>
<malay>malas abeh</malay> [ah] tiring <malay>lagi</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
I was like
[ah] really cannot I really cannot cause I'm type of person [ah] who like (um) prefers everything like to be there in the traditional way [ah] right like physically seeing your lecturer lecturer and then like taking down notes physically
like like I can't can't do I can't do it I can't do the virtual thingy I really I really don't find it like (um)
productive at all for me throughout the whole semester
what about you what about you
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) it's
still not the same right
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>abeh</malay> like (um) <malay>macam mana</malay> [ah] your exam <malay>punya</malay> like (err) format like how how was it like it's it's online right so <malay>macam</malay> like how how did it go
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
[eh] but serious [ah] forty eight hours
[oh] my god
(uh) (uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) !wow!
<malay>leceh</malay> [ah] <malay>leceh</malay>
(mm) okay I see I see [eh] (uh) but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long [eh]
(uh)
[oh] for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that I had was like [ah] twenty four hours [ah] so I cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like !huh! forty eight hours <malay>lama gila</malay>
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
like the questions <malay>banyak ke</malay> like were there like a lot of questions
!wow! five sections
(mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>lama</malay>
(mm) not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
no difference <malay>tak ada tak ada</malay> difference
like why you using serious <malay>tak dengar</malay>
try [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> something
ya is it what you using
(mm) cause it sounds like (uh) (err) <malay>dia macam tak</malay> clear <malay>sangat</malay> so like try it's ya like I cannot really understand what you're saying ya
(mm)
(mm) that's why
okay never mind
can [lah] but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
<malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>sangat</malay> what you trying to say ya
like there's like a bit like
blur blur <malay>sikit</malay>
anyway right (um)
[oh] for me [kan] [ah] yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was [ah] twenty four hours <malay>tapi</malay> like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction [tau] like the instruction were like very specific so
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
eleven questions and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) the eleven questions <malay>tu</malay> like [ah] the marks were different [lah] for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks [ah] so like (um)
[ah] for like for each question (err) (um) my lecturer specified [ah] like (um) <malay>berapa banyak</malay> words
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then (um) [ah] she also specified [lah] like (um) the (uh)
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions I feel like (um) <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> make <malay>tak</malay> make sense [ah] cause like (err) questions two marks [jer] <malay>atau</malay> three marks but like (uh) <malay>dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> (um) the words like limit <malay>dia</malay> like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard [ah] I I don't know it's like (um) it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that (um)
we had to like really (um) arrange like how do I how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like (um) time consuming [lah] [ah] which explains why maybe she like <malay>kasi</malay> us twenty four hours <malay>untuk buat</malay>
ya
eleven essays
ya twenty four hours eleven essays I didn't like <malay>tak tidur</malay> cause like ya I mean it's not that I didn't take breaks in between [ah] but then I did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way way ahead of (um) the the the the submission period
[lah] cause I cause I honestly feel that (um) the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
ya and then then <malay>nanti</malay> last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like (err) everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for I like what (um) like for for me that the twenty four hours (uh) <malay>punya</malay> exam it was like <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it was <malay>penat</malay> [ah] but then like
but then like (uh) how do I say this <malay>dia macam</malay>
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say [kan] it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like (uh) my back was like crying for help
my back crying for help and then ya and (um) like <malay>mata sakit</malay> and everything so <malay>macam</malay> (err) no it's not very like ya it's the worst [ah] I would say the whole the whole
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your (um) attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like (err) I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse [eh] and then like (um) like like like (uh)
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I like I like same as you [ah] I expected like worse cause I feel like (um) some of the modules they were like quite (uh) heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very (um) drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like (mm) like I was quite satisfied with (um) my results [lah] cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being (uh) quite lenient [lah]
like if they weren't lenient maybe I would don't think <malay>boleh lepas</malay>
ya ya
ya
cause like you know you know there are times like (um) (uh) like I I attended like online lectures but then like <malay>macam</malay> like I was there but I was asleep
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[eh] you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
ya ya ya serious <malay>tak bedek</malay>
all okay cause I had this like (um) [ah] I <malay>ada kelas ni</malay> eight thirty [tau] eight thirty in the morning so like
I mean being at home obviously your <malay>macam</malay> sleeping schedule <malay>semua</malay> all over the place [kan] like you just like you will sleep at like three like two like very late <malay>lepastu</malay> like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like (uh) (um) the what <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
ya so I didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty I will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link [ah] I would join <malay>lepastu</malay> the minute I join and then like right [ah] <malay>terus</malay> I I would just go to sleep
and then every time when I wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and I'm still there I mean I I honestly think (uh) I <malay>bukan sorang</malay> cause [ah] when I woke up then I will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and I'm like okay I think we are all in the same boat ya cause no I I really feel like <malay>macam</malay>
cannot [ah]
I really cannot I mean physically physical classes eighty thirty I really feel like it's already (um) not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] online like <malay>tak boleh</malay> !oi!
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> lecturers you <malay>semua</malay> like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some <malay>macam</malay> trouble <malay>juga</malay> with certain lecturers
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(uh huh) (uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) <malay>faham</malay>
[ah] cause
for me like [ah] for me right (um)
most of my lecturers okay [lah] I I guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them I mean it's it's two-way [kan] <malay>macam</malay> if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best I guess and cause it's <malay>semua benda macam</malay> very <malay>baru untuk semua orang</malay>
I think everyone <malay>macam masih nak</malay> adapting to the whole new situations so it's like (uh) I I appreciate that (uh) lecturers I <malay>macam</malay> they were they were okay [lah] but then I did have <malay>macam</malay> trouble <malay>dengan</malay> some
lecturers [ah] cause like I don't know why [ah] <malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like I <malay>ada satu</malay> lecturer <malay>ni</malay> she was like (um)
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
I mean ya I don't know I don't know why [ah] cause I've I I I don't (err) I don't <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> I don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole (um) the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
(um) cause it's online [kan] <malay>abeh macam</malay> she doesn't
she expects us to (err) <malay>macam</malay>
gone through everything I mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything I mean <malay>faham</malay> [lah] we have to do that obviously but then it was like I would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so <malay>macam</malay> it wasn't helpful [lah] she was expecting us to only come to her only <malay>bila kita ada</malay> questions so it was like very hard for me like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> cause especially I don't have my books with me so like
I I left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the so we didn't I didn't have time to pack up whatever I need so it was just like take whatever I whatever I needed and then just <malay>balik</malay> singapore but then like you know so I had I had to leave my books and I really I really I use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya I mean cause I I don't like I don't like online I really cannot like absorb things online so I prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like <malay>macam apa tu</malay> the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
she was like as like for like every week
[ah] <malay>dia akan cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia akan cakap</malay> okay this is the topic we're going to [ah] this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
on our own so <malay>macam</malay> I was like [ah] it wasn't like helpful at all I was like I didn't understand like a lot of things and then like I was like having trouble then I tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is [lah] to to understand to <malay>faham</malay> [kan]
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy (um) course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students [ah] I I honestly feel that way I mean
I I understand that she she wants like <malay>kita nya</malay> level to be like of really university students <malay>tapi macam</malay>
[ah] in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful [lah]
I mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very <malay>leceh</malay> like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were <malay>macam banyak gila benda nak kena</malay> like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very <malay>leceh</malay> and then like
it was very <malay>leceh</malay> and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is which was worse cause (uh) (uh) I had to handle <malay>dengan</malay> all those (um) group members who are just useless
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
working team members which was hard [lah] cause I mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like <malay>macam</malay> equally divided [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
so I was like [ah] it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
like I feel that I don't know I I'm just like (um) <malay>malas</malay> [ah] want to <malay>layan</malay> like
like you know all these drama so I will just be like I do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress [ah] of it but you know some did some did not so it was like [ah] whatever like really I don't care cause for me I care about my grades like you did <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> then <malay>dorang punya pasal</malay> [ah]
but then like for me like I really I really care about my grades so it's like for me I don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like [ah] whatever [ah] <malay>suka hati</malay> [ah] <malay>nak buat pape pun boleh</malay> [lah] ya like ya it's like
like <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay> like you know like <malay>bila</malay> physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
especially when like
(um) like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating [kan]
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
(um) and then (uh) like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours [ah] similar to yours like <malay>dorang kasi kita</malay> choose (um) <malay>nak apa tu nak</malay> individual <malay>atau</malay> group work so it was like okay [lah] I I honestly prefer individual assignments so I don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya

[kan] [kan] [kan] [kan]
ya
ya ya ya
[ah]

<malay>macam apa tu</malay>
like you see when like people really like speak up on like (uh) like current issues like I I really really want to like I really wish I could <malay>macam kadang-kadang macam</malay> [eh] like !ee! I really like like at the back of my head [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there were like a lot of things [tau] I really want to say a lot of things but then like I <malay>macam</malay> [oh] like (uh)
it's like ya I mean I know what to say
okay [what]
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya cause for me right (um) I I I sometimes that I really I know what to say I know what to say it's just that I don't know if I will be able to word it in a way that people understand where I'm coming from you know
[ah] (uh) ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right I really wish <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I I feel that (um) my knowledge or like current issues it's not like I'm not fully equipped on that like I'm still like I still it's not I'm not I don't like (um) follow up on what what's happening [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> like I feel like
no matter like how much I'm updated with what's going on I feel like I'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really <malay>macam</malay> go out there and speak up about things like this [ah]
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like (um) people reply and they have like (err) like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like [oh] no I would I will never do that I mean even though like
ya ya ya I mean like for me <malay>macam kadang-kadang</malay> like I feel I <malay>takut kat walaupun</malay>
my my twitter is like private like private account <malay>tapi</malay>
!huh! <malay>tapi</malay> I I I feel like <malay>macam</malay> like even if I were to tweet it out like I I I will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people I I'm I'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
[kan]
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly [oh] really I mean then
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah] yes yes yes
ya I mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words [kan] like you don't want to <malay>macam</malay> you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like (um) discussion like a healthy one [lah] like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever I don't know it's just really cool I find it like <malay>macam</malay> very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya I mean they are very receptive receptive they are very receptive [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what I find very interesting about twitter [ah]
ya ya I mean
I mean I I find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to I would say <malay>macam</malay> go to newspaper [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(um) sometimes sometimes
sometimes <malay>memang</malay> (mm) (mm) sometimes <malay>memang</malay> tired [ah] actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) cause you feel that sometimes as much as you enjoy reading like people's opinions right you feel that sometimes people are just like the the opinions that you read or whatever tweets that people tweet right it's sometimes if you feel like they screaming at you I don't know sometimes I feel like everyone is being too expressive about everything
sometimes for me ya like it's like [ah] sometimes I feel like [ah] I get I get tired sometimes I get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like (uh) just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like [oh] okay can can already [ah] then you know activate back and then like okay already
ya cause I feel that sometimes like as much as there are a lot of like healthy discussions online there's still like those people who like to force the opinions on other people which is of course not healthy like you know and these are people like you find like
(uh)
<malay>penat</malay> [ah] <malay>baca dorang nya</malay> tweets
it's like (uh) like I mean
ya I mean like sometimes you like I mean I get what you want to say but then sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that people won't like have that same opinion as you you know
you know
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya ya ya
ya ya
I think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like <malay>semua orang</malay> to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one

ya cause
I
[ah] I <malay>lebih</malay> prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
I mean I mean I know [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which <malay>macam</malay> I am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm so like to answer your question I <malay>tak</malay> sure [ah] whether I can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like [ah] similar [lah] to your parents my parents <malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] so ya
<malay>dorang macam [ah] <malay>cari sendiri</malay> they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
I mean I would say my non-existent love life [lah] as of right now
so ya
maybe maybe maybe if I'm like desperate enough then maybe [lah]
maybe like really like reach a certain age then I think I should get married and I don't have anyone then maybe [ah] I will resort to that but like
(um) I <malay>nak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know I feel like I've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing I would want to think about [ah]
like I think I have other things to like think about like right now like like I need I need to figure out what I want to do with my degree
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first [lah] then I can think of like things cause like I don't know like to have like <malay>sekarang</malay> to have love life like right now
it's like (mm) not much ideal for me [ah] cause I feel that I don't even have time for myself like I'm just so busy with school so like to to have like someone in my life right now it's like (um)
ya it's not that it's going to distract me [ah] it's just that I don't I don't know if I can actually fully commit to it you know
ya it's more of that cause like you know obviously school would come first I just so busy with school I'll just be so caught up with school I don't think I would have time for my significant other if I were to ever have one like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so (um) <malay>malas</malay> [lah] also like

people over there were quite (err) <malay>rilek</malay> they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
(err) maybe it won't be as such a big issue [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> after that when I came back (um)
I was given a couple of mask <malay>tapi</malay> I thought like okay [lah] not really necessary but (err) eventually it turns out that
(um) the the the hype so called or the whole issue (err) it it went up and then
so that time <malay>bila</malay> we saw it on the news (err) my my girlfriend's (uh) auntie [lah] so <malay>dia kasi</malay>
(uh) because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only <malay>macam</malay> ten masks or so something like this
<malay>habis</malay> (um) ask us to use it (err) when we are at the airport <malay>sebab</malay> (err) who knows [kan] especially Indonesia <malay>agaknya</malay> maybe
not so safe [lah] and then (err) so I flew back I still wear the mask (uh) at first I thought <malay>macam</malay> too much [ah] actually <malay>macam</malay> maybe
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore (um) and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then (um) the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and (uh) at first I was going to work and slowly (um) you see more and more people
<malay>kat</malay> station <malay>pakai</malay> mask <malay>habis</malay> (um) some of them (err) they there was no form of social distancing [ah] back then so there was no such advice but
mask <malay>ada</malay> quite a number of people they were wearing it [lah] and then (um) they decided to
eventually (err) make an announcement on and said that <malay>dia punya</malay> mask <malay>ini semua</malay> actually not mandatory [lah] at first then <malay>cakap</malay> only <malay>kalau macam</malay> you sick (err) you stay at home
(err) just <malay>jaga</malay> yourself [lah] there's no need to go out (um) and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
(um) slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt <malay>banyak orang orang macam</malay> didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe (err) eventually (um) it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic [lah] <malay>habis</malay> Malaysia <malay>orang</malay> Malaysia affected <malay>orang</malay> Indonesia affected
at first Singapore was the first I remember we were actually the first ranked to <malay>macam</malay> got on the list [lah]
[ah] so at first we were the first <malay>habis</malay>
(um) we were eventually taken over by (um) okay [eh] at first it was China [lah] and then second it was Singapore
at first [ah] this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries (uh) in Italy
(err) in Euro and then slowly got to America and now <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita</malay> in a state where (um)
is the highest [lah] so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
(err) but that's how I remembered my experience (um) when it first started (err) and how at that point of time I was
employed <malay>habis sekarang macam</malay> like looking for job because (uh)
let's put it like (um) I wasn't employed anymore (err) after this whole situation so now looking for job [lah]
how about your experience <malay>macam mana</malay> you were coping with it
okay to be fair I don't think <malay>siapa siapa</malay> anyone [lah] was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and I think a lot of businesses were impacted <malay>banyak</malay> (um) even home based business at some point was (err) affected [kan]
(uh) that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less <malay>macam</malay> slammed her
some authority figure [ah]
ya but (err) because of what she said a lot of people <malay>macam tak</malay> satisfied [lah] <malay>diorang macam</malay>
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
(um) <malay>kena pulau rabak rabak</malay> [lah] basically because of her statement she even
ya and
I think
I think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or <malay>niat dia</malay> the <malay>niat</malay> is there [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good <malay>macam nak tolong</malay> all these regulation issue [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay [lah] I mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
<malay>tapi</malay> because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this COVID situation is (um) what she should have done was
after she did it and of course <malay>nak</malay> return <malay>balik dia punya</malay> statement <malay>susah</malay> [kan] but at least <malay>macam</malay> just go out there and just apologize properly
and say that (uh) you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen (err)
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say (err) I understand
<malay>tapi</malay> she chose to <malay>macam</malay> go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that (err) gone viral for no reason
(um)
and (err) some of them are funny <malay>macam</malay> the recent one where the Foodpanda rider just waving around
and I thought it was our good friend #Hadi# because okay to be fair <malay>sebab</malay>
#Hadi# dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see #Hadi# [kan]
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
<malay>habis</malay> he will <malay>macam</malay> [ah] be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants <malay>cuma</malay> bike is slightly different [lah]
like the first time I saw it <malay>macam</malay> this could be #Hadi#
it could really have been #Hadi# the way they dress <malay>dia punya seluar dengan dia punya</malay> helmet <malay>dia punya</malay> visor
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny [ah] but I saw the article [lah] I think Mothership covered this article about him
(uh) unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but (uh) I think a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> does really
(um) <malay>macam</malay> it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite (uh) positive feedback [ah] about the guy <malay>dia</malay> super extra [ah]
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes [kan]
because if you think about it (um) just the fact that during this whole (uh) circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
and (um) while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large <malay>tapi macam</malay> it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say <malay>macam</malay> this guy this #mat# just <malay>naik</malay> motor <malay>habis</malay> just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that <malay>dia macam</malay> very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
(err) actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
(err) the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
(mm) (mm)
(mm) well I have this opinion about (uh) all these food delivery [ah] so to my understanding [ah]
(err) the first <malay>tak salah</malay> Deliveroo was to start all this <malay>tapi</malay> in Singapore I don't know whether is Uber X or Grab or something [lah]
but what I really feel about food delivery is <malay>dia macam</malay> quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second [ah] about Grab drivers (err) not Grab drivers
but (err) food delivery [eh] so I feel that (um) it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all (um)
people who are do food delivery all this <malay>kalau</malay> they really <malay>macam</malay> really work hard macam #chiong# all the way [ah] <malay>macam</malay> maybe eight hours #chiong# all the way <malay>macam</malay> #Hadi# for example [kan]
(um) they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay> incentive or <malay>macam mana</malay> they hit <malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) hours or <malay>dia punya</malay> right timing [ah] because all these riders [kan] <malay>macam dorang</malay> [dah] experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right <malay>kedai mana</malay> (um)
prepare food quickly <malay>kedai mana</malay> prepare food very slow they know how to play the game [lah] basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and they are blue (err) blue collar workers [kan] so think about this for a second [eh] to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an interview
you don't need to (um) like basically if you apply [kan] most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize <malay>macam</malay> your delivery [ah]
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for (uh) the lower income group to catch up
to the upper income group because <malay>macam</malay> especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars (uh) or something [ah] per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay> beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it [kan] so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar (err) job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about (err) food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
no much prerequisite [lah] maybe if you <malay>macam nak</malay> deliver <malay>naik motor</malay> [kan] then
[ah] <malay>kena pakai lesen</malay> you have to prove your <malay>lesen</malay> [lah] but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so I saw an interview (err) <malay>macam</malay> documentary [lah] don't know on Grab and how (err) some of the handicap people
(um) they managed to get jobs in Grab <malay>macam dulu</malay> (um) when they before Grab [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say <malay>macam</malay> if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes <malay>tapi ada orang macam</malay> down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know <malay>macam</malay> is like a big <malay>macam beban</malay>
<malay>duduk kat rumah jadi beban</malay> [jer] <malay>puas hati macam</malay> you go out earn whatever little money you can and I saw this (uh) girl this Malay girl in a wheelchair [lah]
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day [lah] for example on her electric (err) wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver [lah] maybe <malay>satu hari</malay> deliver four or five items [lah] for example
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is [ah] okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is (um) you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet [lah]
so <malay>macam berdikari</malay> [lah] so instead of
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
the interface <malay>macam</malay> the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
(err) it it simplifies the task basically <malay>pergi sendiri</malay> pick up <malay>pergi sana</malay> drop off so it it it gives this
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to (err)
admin position or something <malay>macam kena</malay> interview <malay>tak tahu</malay> pass <malay>ke tak</malay> (err) your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless <malay>macam kalau</malay> too saturated or something [lah] there's too much driver around so I thought that was quite interesting as well
(um) the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how (uh) blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers <malay>punya</malay> salary
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway (um) with regards to that (uh) there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an indiscrimination kind of
(err) (err) employment
(err) I don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate <malay>macam</malay>
you you don't get (err) you don't get denied (err) okay <malay>selalunya</malay> the idea is when you do the employment [kan] (err) you cannot be judged based on your I don't know (err) race or
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis [lah] in singapore so whether you are (uh) as mentioned before whether you are
(err) low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide [kan]
so <malay>macam</malay> for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver [kan]
so (err) <malay>nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah</malay> so when you're tired you get home
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab (err) you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your (err) (err) picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
so that so called keep them motivated [lah] whereas <malay>macam</malay> delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really (err) let's say you already have a bicycle [lah] let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
and you don't have that burden of [oh] <malay>hari ini kena buat sepuluh</malay> delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
so it it simplifies a little bit
[ah] yes okay definitely [lah] so basically <malay>macam</malay> you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars (err) what you get
is (um) basically is through the app <malay>punya</malay> interface [ah] so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours [lah]
it's it's already a net amount <malay>dorang</malay> already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off (err) because sometimes
for example (um) whatever the food is <malay>dorang</malay> [dah] minus the food amount so (err) this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
<malay>terus</malay> (err) whatever is shown in your phone <malay>macam</malay> you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example [ah] that's yours [lah] basically
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
you are okay let's say you are riding <malay>habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan</malay>
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> !ee! I still got to go on I need to hit (um) ten deliveries today or (uh) I cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
it has that sort of it extended flexibility [ah] and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way [lah] it's just something I just thought about recently
and how it is a good way for people <malay>macam</malay> let's say they have spare time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say they work nine to five
<malay>habis malam macam</malay> they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then (err) just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
maybe (err) do a three hour trip (err) three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home [lah] so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
(uh) as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that (um) a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such (uh) active (um) kind of employment especially for the lower income (uh) people to help a bridge to the higher income people
(err) ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [dah] starting so much on delivery
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
(err) it does
(um) so during the circuit breaker period of [pe] was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing (um) did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery (err) did you meet anyone or
okay question online exam what is stopping people from I mean to <malay>buku letak kat tepi
[oh] okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
what sort of (err) security feature or identification <malay>yang dorang</malay> implement
[kan] <malay>risau</malay>
no [lah] if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say [eh] I'm doing this (err) exam (err) next week
(err) I pay you two hundred dollars [lah] just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay [pe]
man I don't think I can I don't think I can go back to school already <malay>macam</malay> <malay>kirim salam</malay> [ah]
seriously
I mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle [lah] but you think that you are <malay>macam</malay> everything [dah] okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project <malay>kerja</malay> just to survive on the salary from that job
(um) but I kudos to you [lah] <malay>memang</malay> is not easy to go back to school when I if you ask me to do it now I would probably won't don't it
right well characters is something inevitable
or Facebook <malay>ada</malay> politics [pe] <malay>sekolah pun ada</malay> politics [pe] but one thing I okay so just to do a very very
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
in school <malay>walaupun</malay> you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever <malay>belajar</malay> but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that <malay>macam</malay> there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying <malay>macam nak</malay> enjoy <malay>susah</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> okay it it depends on people right so (um)
I think also it depends on school as well [ah] because when I was in uni (uh) (um) a lot of people who went to like me [kan] they (err)
two major popular universities that they went to is either or [eh] so <malay>macam sekolah</malay> so basically you study throughout the whole year
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
whereas for the one that I went to basically (err) <malay>buat</malay> project
(err) it it it becomes like what (uh) eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent <malay>kat belakang</malay> exam
so in a way you can balance [oh] out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have <malay>macam ada</malay> solid group you can work with
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but (err)
I don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but I am sure yours <malay>ada</malay> project [kan]
sometimes (err) if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
(err) for a couple of years you actually (um) understand and appreciate what (err) higher academia can bring compared
to your peers (err) in school at the moment [kan] even for myself [kan] if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and (um) if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or (uh) it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to <malay>macam</malay> all these <malay>budak budak</malay> they still have not have a taste of full life <malay>macam</malay> full working employment yet
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
(um) you know it's the uncertainty of (err) okay [lah]
you know if I don't do well then don't do well [lah] you know but (uh) once you are in a position where you are out
that's why I think a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay> (um) went to you uni SIM basically (err) university
night university [lah] so <malay>dia orang</malay> juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life [ah] there's no more social life basically
(err) <malay>pagi pagi</malay> daytime you go to work and then (err) malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time <malay>nak buat</malay> (err) <malay>nak buat</malay> group assignment <malay>nak</malay> study <malay>untuk</malay> exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
is very exhausting and (um) some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful (err) well kudos them
ya there's a lot of compromise (err) and you have to be willing to <malay>macam</malay> at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social [lah] because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
no [lah] at first to be honest [ah] at first <malay>bila</malay> all this thing happen [kan] <malay>macam</malay> (um) it's interesting (err) because is something novel
<malay>macam</malay> is not common <malay>apa dulu</malay> to to (um) communicate through okay maybe for you [lah] but for me it's I it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family <malay>tapi</malay> when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
(err) at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime (uh) <malay>kerja</malay> (err) in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward <malay>macam</malay> I think it depends on people also [lah] because <malay>ada orang ada orang boleh</malay> focus when they're at home
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks [lah] toilet [lah]
or the bed sleep [lah] take a nap during lunch time <malay>tu semua</malay> for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas <malay>kalau macam kat tempat kerja</malay> you've got to drag your ass and then
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people (um)
they switch into mode you know <malay>macam</malay> home mode (err) <malay>duduk kat rumah macam</malay>
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when I'm at home I'm always feel like I'm in relaxing <malay>punya</malay> mode
and when I'm out I feel like I'm in out mode you know when your hair is <malay>macam</malay> all wax style and then
[ah] you know you're wearing clothes (um) and then you go out and [eh] you you just have that vibe <malay>macam</malay> I'm I'm ready to take on the work
you know <malay>macam</malay> when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video Netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
(err) I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
(um) if doubly is even a word for studying
so !aiya! I mean so
no don't get me wrong I enjoy I enjoy the break I enjoy the break in (um) I enjoy the break in the regimen I enjoy the break in <malay>dia punya</malay> scheduling and stuff like that <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know [eh] ultimately it is a state of mind [lah] so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
<malay>macam dekat rumah</malay> you can just eat <malay>macam</malay> you can snack and all that shit (err) but <malay>kalau kat luar</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> you need to walk for it and (uh) I don't know
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you (err) do delivery (uh) I think the so called delivery fee is about <malay>macam</malay> four dollars something like this [kan]
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type (err) Foodpanda pro
and you can actually see they have <malay>macam</malay> those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package <malay>tak salah</malay> is (err)
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
no it's like a pass [lah] it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's <malay>apa macam</malay> limited edition [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's actually has been around for awhile
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but (err) if you go now it's definitely available
[oh] well people still deliver food a lot of people still <malay>macam</malay> still work from home [pe] <malay>banyak orang</malay> work from home [pe] <malay>sekarang</malay> [lah]
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well #Nurul# didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker [lah] so it's a different story but for those people who
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while <malay>sampai sekarang</malay>
suspect until the end of the year [ah]
fishy [ah] the Russian <malay>punya</malay> vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three [what]
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]

<malay>empat</malay> it was (ugh) didn't like it is too late I forever young what you talking about man I'm you're only as old

what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
(hmm)
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
thirty more seconds <malay>kita kena</malay> clap [eh] <malay>lepas ini</malay> or
<malay>habis</malay> just stop [jer]
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour
okay <malay>tak apa tak apa tak apa</malay> (uh) it just crossed one hour for me so I am gonna turn it off right now

okay <malay>boleh dengar</malay>
all right
ya
<malay>kalau tidak nanti</malay> it becomes distorted
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit [ah]
is it
okay okay then <malay>aku</malay> adjust
the boundary [ah] okay <malay>aku baru pasang</malay>
shit
I don't know what went wrong [ah] honestly [ah] honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic [ah] I was like
okay [lah] <malay>aku tak buat salah</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't see
even if I was the instructor
I wouldn't penalize myself (uh) just now [ah] maybe yesterday okay [lah] because yesterday <malay>aku macam kaku sikit</malay> because I didn't ride for very long right
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
to me I didn't want to say I experience I didn't want to [lah] but <malay>aku dah datang lambat semalam</malay>
<malay>semalam aku tak lambat</malay> so
then he started the face like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tahu macam oren penyet punya</malay> [kan] looking not happy like that so I was like okay [lah] I tell him I said okay I got experience like that (uh) (uh) <malay>kau</malay> experience <malay>kat mana aku cakap dulu</malay> I [oh] okay somebody go ask <malay>sampai</malay> back <malay>berapa</malay> then like (uh)
<malay>empat ke lima</malay> [ah] after second assessment
[oh] okay okay this one not for you go that one <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay>
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit [ah]
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike [ah]
and obviously I I kept stalling like I (um) not midway but I kept stalling at that place <malay>yang</malay> you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or what I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so <malay>dia macam</malay> when I'm moving then <malay>dia</malay> stall stall stall <malay>gitu</malay>
but apart from that
I think
I don't see anything wrong with it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> they ask you to play from gear one to gear two right that's what I did
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know [ah] cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
I think maybe it was probably twenty or twenty five or something like that <malay>aku bawa</malay> maybe thirty five [ah] thirty or thirty five [ah] it break <malay>dia punya</malay> speed [ah]
so the the problem was (uh) okay that that was yesterday so <malay>aku faham</malay>
and I accepted it [lah] ya but today
(um) I started out with the mini circuit
I made less than less than ten rounds [ah] it was very fast I make less than ten rounds and then what happened was (um) <malay>dia cakap</malay> okay (uh) he put two people out
like it was me and it was that that that that girl [lah] so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance [ah] maybe today I might pass [ah] that kind of thing
but no
<malay>tak nak</malay> [lah]
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
fact ni <malay>cakap</malay> I didn't even stall today <malay>macam</malay> because I remembered doing this and I remembered I remembered riding like this the same way before and I pass
this time I failed he just said he just said you need more practice <malay>kepala otak dia</malay> [lah] need more practice at least you come and tell me <malay>macam</malay> maybe I did something wrong maybe <malay>aku terlalu laju</malay> or <malay>aku macam</malay> maybe I don't know maybe I didn't break before I change gear or something like that you know at least it's it's it's
I would learn from it and you know <malay>ini macam</malay> guessing game you know or not like [oh] I asked him I asked me just now I said [oh] actually what what went wrong like
!wah! <malay>tadi kau</malay> okay (uh) everything okay breaking okay <malay>tak macam semalam</malay> cause it it was the same fella ya the same instructor
then I said [oh] then
then why I cannot the same ride again [ah]
[oh] <malay>takde apa-apa kau</malay> just need a a bit a bit a bit a of practice only just familiarise a bit more with the bike
no then inside my head I'm thinking <malay>kepala otak kau kau pun</malay> every prac <malay>kau pegang motor ke sama juga</malay> [kan] it's the same it's the same model [what] it's the same bike [what] what what is it that's so different
then I I I I got a bit irritated [lah] at that point of time then I just [ah] ya you know <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
so
[oh] so that was me and then about that girl
she was (um) she was okay she she also failed
but <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> failure <malay>aku faham</malay> because I saw I saw what happened the first time she fell I didn't see the fall but she really <malay>tergolek</malay> you know <malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
because she okay you you try to visualise what where where I'm talking about [ah] okay basically when you ride on top they are four corners right she fell at the one you know where or not <malay>yang belakang yang</malay> that that wall
the sledge of wall no no E break is <malay>hujung sana ini yang dekat dengan</malay> admin <malay>punya</malay> side
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back [ha] so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
time <malay>belok</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> turning [ah] <malay>ada</malay> cornering [ah] so
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
I was in front of her so <malay>aku bawa</malay> okay everything <malay>semua</malay> okay so I already made one round already
and then
and then the instructor <malay>pun satu bodoh punya mangkuk</malay> she fell at the place where I really couldn't see
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there [lah]
but I don't I also forgot about the mirror I didn't look at the mirror [lah] but I won't speeding I won't because that part <malay>memang</malay> you have to go down to get to that turn [what]
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place [eh] I already down to gear two already even before that [ah]
then <malay>aku belok sekali ada</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku ingat dia tengah baring</malay>
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there [ha] my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that [lah] that's why he stood there
because the other places where you turn <malay>ada orang</malay> it's quite open but that particular corner is is is [ha] <malay>memang</malay> seclude you cannot see anything there [ah]
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
[ha] then the instructor was like (uh) <malay>apa kau buat lagi</malay> !alamak! <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay> [kan] then after that I I just I just don't I I don't get don't get don't get I just stop [ah] stop and wait
then after that (uh) she was trying to pick up the mood
then she obviously her technique failed she gotta pick up the bike because because the bike was lying on the on the right and she was trying to pull to the left <malay>memang tak boleh</malay> [lah] of course cannot
so the instructor was like what what happened to you [ah] I told you how to do this and told you how to do that then why are you still making the same mistake again or whatever this and that [ah] so I guess <malay>takpe saya boleh tolong pasal dia jambu ke</malay>
no I was still on my bike
[ha] instructor instructor was there all the while [ha] so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
and then ask her whether the she okay or not then she turned back and smile at she say [eh] sorry [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> in your way I say nevermind it's okay [lah] you just
just do your thing [ah] then the instructor go and tell her some more you know [ha] <malay>masa dah buang ni lagi</malay>
[ha] you concentrate or your bike [ha] you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall [ah] because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver [lah] maneuver the the turn but she
she likes to <malay>macam himpit</malay> to the left side
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
[ha] cause it's it's a bend [what]
so no she probably got so close and after that she <malay>gabra</malay> because she was in the wrong lane after that so she skid and then she fall down but the funny thing was the bike was on my on the bike was on my lane
[ha] <malay>badan dia pula</malay> was on the other lane
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
but like I said that spot where she fell you cannot see from from before you literally need to reach that bend then you <malay>kau boleh kau boleh nampak dia</malay>
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no [lah] I'm okay [lah] okay
and then after that (uh) she was trying to start the bike [ah] <malay>kelakar</malay> cause when she fell [kan] I think the instructor went to kill switch so she didn't know
then she sat on the bike she tried to start but cannot start and then <malay>apa</malay> she said [eh] (uh) I think my motorbike spoiled <malay>dia cakap macam tu</malay> and then the instructor said your bike is not spoiled <malay>dia ingat</malay> spoiled <malay>dia</malay> try try try nothing and then she just got the clicking sound click clik clik [one] you cannot hear the engine starting [ah]
then after that like
!alamak! how <malay>ni</malay> [eh] <malay>gini gini gini</malay> then he go there he said this one your switch your switch [ha] check your switch okay
then <malay>dia</malay> begin
after that (uh) when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
(uh) the instructor tell me he said (uh)
<malay>takpe</malay> (uh) number one you go first I said but I thought you cannot overtake <malay>takpe takpe takpe</malay> I was number one she was number seven or nine I got number one [ah] so after that <malay>sampai habis</malay>
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her [kan] he say you just go ahead first [ah]
so I was just riding and riding and riding <malay>macam</malay> no problem [lah] to me literally like no problem I didn't even but there was one instructor was damn bloody annoying
because he the one <malay>yang pakai</malay> bandana I don't know you know or not to me he's damn bloody fucking annoying [ah] tall guy malay
<malay>muka dia macam mat</malay> [sial] <malay>sikit dia dia</malay> was on the he was on the he was at the bend <malay>yang depan lagi</malay> before you turn back into the the the admin area <malay>dia jatuh</malay> part <malay>sini kira</malay> square
<malay>macam ni</malay> [kan] admin area <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] <malay>dia ada tempat sini si</malay> instructor <malay>lagi satu dia lepak sini</malay> the other side but when I was there and I wasn't speeding I wasn't because it
makes sense or not if you're not speeding or if you you already drop your speed <malay>kau nak</malay> brake <malay>buat apa</malay> you're already breaking already [what] I put on on on gear two and I I don't need to break and I don't need to clutch in nothing so I was just the bend and it wasn't
<malay>macam</malay> you can hear the engine sounds vroom it's just nice [ah] turn and like <malay>salah salah kau kena</malay> brake <malay>lagi kau kena</malay> brake <malay>lagi</malay> brake brake <malay>sebelum kau</malay> down gear brake <malay>kau nak</malay> brake <malay>apa</malay> [lah] [siol] so
at that point of time the more he talk the more <malay>aku</malay> #peng# [ah] but I guess no he wasn't he was he like he was the one with three <malay>tudung</malay> girls in his class
[ha] prac one
<malay>tapi dia orang baru nak keluar</malay> [ah] so
<malay>aku rasa dia nak malukan aku ke apa</malay> [ah] just want to start one again ya I guess normal [leh] you know whatever [lah] [eh]
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
for me [lah] as far as I'm concerned nothing went wrong <malay>dia suruh aku main</malay> one two one two one two three <malay>aku</malay> one two three one two four and back round to one okay no problem
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
<malay>jadi</malay>
when I got the results I was like
the fuck [sial]
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
[ha] plank plank quite <malay>senang</malay> [what]
no to me
really [meh] you use your foot brake [what]
really
!huh!
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
[oh] class two ten seconds slower [ah]

(mm)
confirm [ah]
[ah]
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred [ah]

ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening [ha]
sell out your bike first
(mm)
(mm)
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think that you should consider that
you don't upgrade now [lah] #dol# you you get your two A bike whatever super four ke three ten <malay>ke</malay> something like that okay you ride that bike for as long as you can and then once <malay>kau dah</malay>
confident once <malay>kau rasa macam</malay> you know your your your balls are big you dare to take a bigger bike [ha] that is five six years later you you change [ah] you don't have to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] I get class two <malay>sekarang juga aku nak tukar</malay> [ha]
there are many people who have class two bikes [ah]
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is [ah] on the roads [ah] that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred (hmm) (mm)
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but ya (um) then then then they are super fours in exactly the same look at the bike the body the <malay>lampu</malay>
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
<malay>sama aja</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[ah]
is it
ya
!huh!
per two weeks
[oh] engine oil to [oh] you change [ah] ya that's about two weeks [lah]
sixty
[oh] ya ya ya (mmhmm)
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four bottles <malay>mampus mampus</malay>
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
(mm)
ya [lah] because you got to change it frequently <malay>apa</malay>
forty eight ya
for every
[ah]
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer [ah] get the touring bike
get a short touring bike
(uh)
have [what] [ah] three ten is is <malay>pendek</malay> [what]
but you can lower the expansion you the zontes three ten can lower down the expansion yes but zontes three ten <malay>cantik</malay> [sia]
it's nice
it looks like bro
[eh] but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
the <malay>yang</malay> one ninety
it looks like the zontes right
but ya ya the zontes is bigger (uh)
the the the the <malay>apa</malay> the capacity capacity I think is
one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five [oh] but
<malay>dia punya</malay> tank [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> tank is I think fifteen or sixteen litres
fifteen I think sixteen litres [ah]
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty
ya but the thing is a zontes <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>misal kata</malay> if I were to use the bike in another country if I go to another country and if that bike <malay>mampus ke apa ke kat sana</malay> bro I'm dead [sia]

the the chances of people sending their their their their slots like very high like everyday be lazy [what]
so
even when I was
even when I continued doing (uh) when in woodlands when I was staying at chinatown
<malay>pun ada juga</malay> I remembered my prac two and prac three was on the same day
(mm) <malay>kalau</malay> I book prac two (uh) in the afternoon I think it was one plus I finished my prac I pass I went to I went to different one
and that was about four plus so by the time <malay>ayah aku ambil aku</malay> was I remember was about seven plus
<malay>mati balik rumah ni</malay> [tau]
it's possible [lah]
but on that day there also three point two <malay>yang</malay> fail
I remember three point two E brake [ah]
brake <malay>aku laju sangat</malay>
fail
brake <malay>aku</malay> brake [ah] <malay>pakai dua-dua</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau tak</malay> jammed <malay>apa</malay>
no I think (uh) exceeded the line got exceeded the line
because <malay>aku</malay> was on gear one got less than two seconds <malay>lepas tu</malay> ram <malay>aku tukar jalan</malay> so basically that that gear two itself was was up to me me everybody
so by the time <malay>aku</malay> [ah]
so by the time <malay>aku dah nak sampai</malay> yellow light all I have to do is I just have to stop locating and then steer back down my my rear and and and front brake
the back also
but the the pullback you will feel [lah] because your engine breaking is active [what] [ah] then you really feel the thing on the the whole bike were you'll feel the jerk [ah]
no my last was (uh) circuit division
<malay>aku punya</malay> assessment <malay>aku ambil dua kali</malay>

so I went to throttle but I think what happened was the the there was skid mark on the floor
so I throttle the whole bike went this way [sia]
I cannot turn
too fast already [ha] so just one thing slip so instead of the bike flying
the bike actually just drop <malay>aku pula yang</malay> slide cause it was <malay>licin</malay>

and then she said because she's been driving for many years already
then after that (uh) she was telling me [ah] no then
she ask me whether I was in contact with anybody from the deliveroo
then I said I said not really only sophie [ah] and then I don't know about you I say were you still there then she said no [lah] for some time already I'm not there I think she left
in october or something like that last year [ah] last year last year october

but #dayah# ruby all went before her
first round of of of retrenchment #dayah# was the head of customer service [ah]
my head [lah] if she head of customer service [sial] [lah] no professionalism [sial] <malay>si bengap tu</malay>
[ah]
we used to order [lah] we used to order for dinner
after nine plus
eleven you are entitled to <malay>makan</malay> fifty dollars
per person ya
okay
normal [lah]
(mm) (mm)
now
is
clear cut dishonesty [sia]
terrible [ah]
of course [ah]
[ah]
you told me this one you told me
this one you told me but when was this this year
#dayah# smoke or no
I never seen her smoke ruby smokes #dayah# I don't know
I never see but #dayah# always try to act like the <malay>kakak-kakak</malay> in the office I cannot I cannot <malay>tahan</malay>
I really cannot <malay>tahan lagi dengan dia punya muka dengan dia punya</malay>
maybe [ah] <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> makeup <malay>dengan dia punya bontot gitu</malay> [kan] [eh] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [sia]
I mean you know honestly what [lah] just she's just
[kan] I told I told #shida# and her off before [what] #shida# and ruby off before at the office I think that from there already they won't come in I say you all you all treat the office like a playground
you know I never saw them in the corporate world
(mm)
but long time ago you still there [lah]
but I think on the day you were not working I I I didn't like #shida# from day one [one]
to me #shida# is just
a nuisance
I don't know how she was in youtrip [ah] but in deliveroo she was terrible
character wise
but ya [lah] that's the that's the that's the whole
and then rational why I I kind of didn't really like
I mean
I took that job because
and I came back from europe I had no job like literally nothing
ya no actually I ask you for it because you actually told me about the job before I went to europe and I said I don't want [ah] I said I didn't want cause you join them a few months (uh) two months before me nevermind <malay>aku cakap dengan kau aku tak nak</malay> [kan] I said don't want [lah] okay [lah] to me if that customer is <malay>dayah kau</malay> stay away from me [lah]
but when I came back to singapore I was like what to do <malay>aku takde duit</malay> [sia] then I was like work or not to work work on to work <malay>nak duit</malay> [ah]
then I message sophia <malay>tanya dia ada lubang ke tak</malay> but <malay>apa</malay> [tau] they were teasing you also like you said you forward it to keith and then I was asking you I say that this will get back to you and he say no whatever
then after that and then you give me keith's number then when I call keith ask me to come down come down <malay>bukan</malay> interview [sia] <malay>aku datang terus kerja</malay>
and then I'm like [ah] then I had to sign the the the stupid !huh! no last time attendance [kan] sign that that paper right what the the one in the hut the hut the hut
whatever [lah]
then I <malay>siap macam kena</malay> interview but he never interviewed until like one month later
(mm)
that's why ruby tried to start <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> with me but I was I wasn't really interested [ah] like ruby <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] when I came into the office already and someone was it was I remember someone when I came in like eleven o'clock shift or something like that <malay>kau dapat dalam</malay>
and then (um) I was sitting beside
(um) sophia B
then
sophia at that point of time I saw okay [lah] not bad [lah] at that point of time [ah] the woman <malay>dia buka dia punya mulut aku dah</malay> [ah] fuck man [ah] so <malay>aku macam</malay> [siol] [ah]
I don't know [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> pitching <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> the way she talks quite irritating <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
so <malay>aku</malay> just
the the random on that very first day of work [eh] <malay>lepas tu dia cakap jom hisap rokok aku tak nak</malay> sophie I say after lunch [lah] it's like [eh] <malay>jom hisap rokok turun</malay> the first she say
<malay>kau nak mati</malay>
ya I don't have I'm like
<malay>aku rasa aku ada</malay> [ah] during that time <malay>aku dengan erin dah dah dah</malay> on the rock <malay>aku rasa aku ada rasa</malay> [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] I say no [lah] no [lah] I have I have
I just don't think my relationship will last [ah] then she was like [oh] take it slow take slow everybody got their hard place <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at that point <malay>dia punya laki masih kat dalam</malay>
<malay>sekarang aku tak tahu</malay>
where is she you also don't know where [ah]
<malay>sebab dia gila pangkat</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia gila pangkat</malay> but she's very she's very [ah] subtle [leh] cannot really predict what she's going to do <malay>dia</malay> very quiet <malay>tapi dia punya orang</malay> she knows want she wants and then she'll slowly #shida# told you [oh] and then she go and ya she told me she told me
then you telling me [one] <malay>kau tak boleh</malay> trust how the ya you told me I remember you had some issues before <malay>rabak</malay> [kan] <malay>aku pernah cakap dengan kau</malay> never ever trust anybody

then
ya [lor]
then <malay>semua orang macam tak nak</malay> join <malay>dorang punya</malay> group so thirteen me cause I was unhappy with #mumtaz# then I asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then I kept [eh] you all want to join me <malay>kita</malay> book <malay>kita sewa</malay> bus then <malay>macam</malay> okay okay [ah] okay [lor]

my job is to just collect money
I'm the estate manager so why
[oh]

poly year one
ya
before [eh] mine year one don't stay back I just take my O level

why
ya cause K
I don't want to take private okay <malay>aku tak nak</malay> stereotype [ah] but you look at the people who take private O level
[ha]
I I got that mindset [lah] last time
and cause you know you don't know anyone there then you want to ask the teacher also you are not familiar with
then might as well I just fully focus as a full-time student just retake
<malay>tebalkan muka</malay> [ah]
and apparently I I was the only one <malay>yang</malay> retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take O level but then now I don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back <malay>malu</malay> I guess so ya [lah] <malay>tapi ustazah siapa</malay> #masniah# <malay>tak salah</malay>

previous seniors [ah] like they retake <malay>tapi</malay> they are exempted from
unnecessary modules [ah]

okay so the you know the (um) with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically (um) it's a K pop song by shinee
(um) ya so (um) so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny (uh) K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
too and and and then they <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>buat</malay> videos <malay>yang</malay> can make you pause for a while and like [oh] I'll double tap that
it's I never heard I never heard
[oh] okay okay (uh) maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
<malay>entah aku tak tahu</malay> but we'll find out soon
I recently learn this term it's called (um) (um)
kissing my teeth but if you've seen it on twitter stands for kissing my teeth
so like (um) like you're not you know that that meme <malay>yang</malay> the person is like (um) like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see <malay>maknanya</malay> kiss kiss my teeth
so like for example (uh)
what what's the [oh] ya ya ya ya I know it's so true [oh] my god
like once you respond <malay>habis</malay> that's it (mm)
I do it you know I've got come my <malay>adik</malay> I do it at #nasha# when I ask her to like get me something
[eh] #nasha#
I am a <malay>minah</malay> at heart
[ah] I mean like that number [ah] the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so (um) like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
it's six o'clock that's it I <malay>tutup</malay> my laptop I roll over to my bed and I <malay>buka</malay> tiktok
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
and she was like you <malay>tak nak makan</malay> [eh] and I was like [oh] right dinner I totally forgot
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
(um) because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily (uh) loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main (um)
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like (err) an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on (uh) any
(uh) any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
today I learn so <malay>macam</malay> like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say [oh] that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I I thought it was like the musically <malay>yang bodoh punya</malay>
ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
yes yes and we know that musically <malay>dengan</malay> vine <malay>tu semua budak kecil</malay>
yes like the <malay>budak mana</malay> from #clementi# <malay>tengah buat</malay> dancing
[ah] tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your page cause it's well curated [oh] I see it is on your page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize [eh] you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once (uh) once it realizes that [eh] this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin> to see you

hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff #anime# you probably won't go the other way
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching #anime#
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got #saiki#
the disastrous life of #saiki#
[oh] that's good
(um) it's more slice of life I guess (um) so I guess I prefer that kind rather than <malay>macam</malay> like actually the things I remember watching
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like (um) slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called #saiki# (um)
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so <malay>macam</malay> for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers <malay>kalau dia tak pakai</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti dia bangun pagi</malay> [kan] <malay>terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah</malay>
like exploded
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like <malay>urut</malay> me like he would <malay>urut</malay> and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
strength [ah] yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also (uh) teleport (um)
he he can he has pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole #anime#
ya it's just him
the whole #anime# revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep (uh) people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole #anime# he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
(um) you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
it's so <malay>merepek</malay> but it's so good it's so <malay>kelakar gila</malay> like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
okay yes yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch [ah] #saiki# it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I <malay>rasa belum habis</malay>
like I've started two three weeks ago I <malay>rasa belum habis</malay>
(um) I don't know it's about twenty three plus
I watch I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time <malay>tak habis-habis</malay> [tau] I'm like <malay>bila ni</malay>
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like !wow!
right right I should have finished like one season
<malay>aku tak tahu ada berapa</malay> season <malay>berapa banyak</malay> episode I'm still with season two [tau] season freaking two
ya ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> total <malay>aku tak tahu aku belum</malay> I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
I'm starting there
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that [lah] cause I guess I can relate to it more <malay>macam</malay> #shonen# is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
ya you really have to get into it
even this one <malay>tak masuk akal pun</malay> at least I I can relate
[oh]
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a #gundam# series on kids central
[oh]
ya
(mm) (mm)
yes yes
yes
(mmhmm)
ya
okay okay
(mm)
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact #gundam# I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
(hmm)
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into #gundam# and you're like no
#gundam#
I I actually (um) because I brought home #najhah's# <malay>punya</malay> (um) #haikyu# jacket and
[ah] it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now (um)
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite <malay>berisi juga</malay> like she's not stick thin
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet [lah] correct
(um) so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
plus it's like her favourite show so I <malay>tak nak hampakan</malay> [lah]
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
[ah] no I think it's still with #aisyah# okay nevermind that's fine
ya so (um)
I I told her like [eh] sorry [ah] I really cannot bring you because sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would (um)
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch (um)
but some countries
she knows but some countries its thirteen I saw [ah] I saw on reddit she's on fucking reddit
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like [oh] my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask <malay>kak zan</malay> and <malay>kak najhah</malay> you <malay>jangan macam gini</malay> [eh]
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya (um) it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze (um) there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends [lah] or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is (err) five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really (um) topics that you don't understand like (uh) explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because (um)
I like to read like I like tea you know to (um)
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
some how are some people are just really ridiculous [tau] <malay>merepek gila</malay> [tau] <malay>dia punya perangai</malay> and then after awhile I realized that for
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their (um) comments is always [oh] this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad [lah] I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
[oh] ya so back to [ah] so (um) so I asked her like (uh) can you give like (uh)
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere [lah] and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
#izz# can easily catch up [eh]
[ah] okay [lah] not bad [lah]
[oh] yes
not bad
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like [eh] sixteen where you want to find online <malay>macam mana</malay> cannot because it's sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the thirteen one
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
[oh] okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
[oh] my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
(um) this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with #sha# it was after A levels
(um) I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about (uh) this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
(um) came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian (um)
okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this (um) spies
jesse mccartney no [lah] that's a singer <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] <malay>sampai</malay> [jer] <malay>kutuk aku</malay> <malay>bukan</malay>
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>tak boleh haram</malay>
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
!wow! really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was (um) a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and (uh) so he was videotaped right and then the spies executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like [oh] I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you (um)
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
(uh huh) like nudity or sexual references (uh) ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending [oh] it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
(mm)
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like [oh] okay !wow!
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it [oh] my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
[ah] <malay>biasa</malay> okay [lah] <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>apa apa</malay> [lah] #shah#
ya !alah!
[ah] right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
(um) this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya #wey# or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with #haikyu# she was really into #haikyu# her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that (um) but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance (uh) series
when I was younger [lah] when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] [oh] my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
[a'ah]
it really impacted the way (um) I saw how relationships or is
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like <malay>tunduk</malay> to the husband
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
you should just have said <malay>tiga</malay> so
<malay>kau datang dari</malay> drama <malay>mana ni</malay>
ya
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched <malay>nur</malay>
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this (um) new <malay>ustaz baru</malay> graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a a celebrity preacher
who has his own (um) <malay>tahfiz</malay> school and his own <malay>masjid</malay>
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so (uh) so he's a very popular
preacher on on and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
and then one day while he was giving the <malay>ceramah subuh</malay> thank god he he
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
<malay>kat masjid dia orang</malay> and then he received like some questions of people (um) and it's really weird because
[ha] <malay>dia orang</malay> Q&A <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> Q&A session (uh) the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version <malay>masjid</malay> version
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like (uh) thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out (um) it was from this girl
<malay>bila keluar masjid then dia nampak</malay> this <malay>kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis</malay> on a white piece of paper
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial (um) like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like respectful the person like
he was <malay>macam</malay> ya like !wow!
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like [oh] my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have (uh) this kind of like
(uh) ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
(uh) fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like (um)
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
so but like more in depth [lah] so like for him like want to provoking <malay>macam hati dia macam</malay> #dup# #dup#
(uh) <malay>kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni</malay>
yes it is idiot
so okay so #tup# #tup# they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so (uh) he was looking for her
everywhere like <malay>dia punya dekat jalan</malay> and they met and they dated
[a'ah]
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she <malay>tergesa-gesa</malay> but the she just
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like (um) like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like [oh] my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay [lah] when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything (um)
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> the level of patients and the
[ha] it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean (um) the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was <malay>cinta si</malay> wedding planner
with (uh) starting #mira filzah# and if you know #adi putra#
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first #mira filzah# was twenty four seven
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then <malay>kat rumah</malay> and she's about to sleep and she's wearing <malay>tudung</malay>

disrupt other people's family or [what] then you know their plans
but you cannot <malay>lawan</malay> them [what]
so you <malay>jampi</malay> them and get back
I will only <malay>jampi</malay>

requirement is like <malay>kena</malay> male female male female I don't know they have weird

of course these are all <malay>syirik</malay> but
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places [what]
all the haunted places
then that time I I tell I thought I told you before
then I when (um) they say always go in even numbers right went in odd
then I was the only girl and I was having my menses
then <malay>semua kena kacau</malay>
except for me
ya like <malay>kena tarik kaki</malay> then like
<malay>mak kau terkejut aku</malay> I also don't know [sia]
then they ask me [eh] <malay>kau pakai barang</malay> [eh] then I was like
<malay>pakai barang apa</malay> [sia]
then after that
<malay>antara kita semua</malay>
high likely <malay>kau yang patut kena kacau asal kita orang pula yang kena</malay>
<malay>kau tak kena langsung</malay> and the thing is while while we were there there's like (um)
a veranda
out on level two or level three then we were just there sitting to smoke first [ah] before going down back because the place was like super horrible with a lot of broken glasses and such
then while sitting there a black figure was
like
you know I can feel all these right
and and the black figure
all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung (uh)
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
then the rest was just standing around then <malay>dia dekat atas</malay> like
over over me and my friend so I was like they said <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tu benda kau punya</malay> then I was like

people beside me and
out of out of like
we went <malay>satu dua tiga empat</malay> (uh) five of us right
three of them can see things
then then they saw [ah] they saw <malay>kakak</malay> they saw <malay>itu</malay> they saw <malay>ini</malay>
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
that his mum [lah] [kan] <malay>nenek bising cakap apa</malay>
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
(mm) what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
keep on <malay>suruh-suruh</malay>
[ah]
then like [eh]
<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> like [eh] if I got a husband
like keep on asking me to <malay>buat tu buat ni buat tu buat ni</malay> and he's just sitting there and smoking like I will fucking slap his face with a broom [sia] and I ask for a divorce
I don't know
should we go to <malay>ustaz</malay> and ask
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
<malay>kita memang kena patut pun</malay>
<malay>ustaz kena bayar ke</malay>
not really <malay>salah bawa</malay> [lah]
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not

<malay>apa benda</malay>
I <malay>lupa nak</malay> reply her
like I totally forgot about it I was like
okay I'm going to reply her after I <malay>makan</malay>
then like after I <malay>makan</malay> I was like
resting
then I totally forgot that she texted
then I felt bad then I told my mum about it [lah] I was like
[oh] the is still trying to convince me to like (um) for her
<malay>tapi</malay> like I don't want then I felt like
I was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and I'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
so <malay>semalam</malay> like
I told my mum and my <malay>kakak</malay> was like
we're going out at one
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go
but then
at
okay I woke up at eight
to like clean like cause <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (err) yesterday I spent the whole day shifting
my <malay>almari</malay> from my room to my guest room
then I was doing it myself I had to take out all the <malay>buku-buku</malay>
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>berat gila</malay>
and then like I was too tired so
I continued today
ya so I woke up at eight when I slept at two
and then I shifted all the I I I <malay>simpan</malay> the book <malay>balik</malay>
then I fell asleep
and then what happened to the one <malay>keluar</malay> you know what time we <malay>keluar</malay> or not we went out like
freaking six ya
so we only went into spotlight and I told you about the patterns that I wanted to <malay>beli</malay> right
busy you know cause okay
I went to spotlight <malay>sebab</malay> I want to find
<malay>kain</malay>
for the inside layer for my mask cause I want to <malay>jahit</malay> for my
family members [kan]
which <malay>tak habis-habis</malay>
ya so I was trying to find a breathable <malay>kain</malay>
then
(err)
but my another
main thing that I wanted to <malay>cari</malay> was the
dress patterns [lah] the one that I told you about that I wanted to
make
[kan]
so
the first thing I did was
like find the <malay>kain</malay>
and then I was like flabbergasted I don't know why
but I was like super
anxious and then and then I walk you know like the entire spotlight
and I forgot to take the the pattern
and (err) and then like (uh) I tried to find the pattern then like I I I went around like the entire
spotlight but I couldn't find it
turns out it was like <malay>dekat dalam</malay>
an <malay>almari</malay>
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then I was like am I allowed to like just pull this out
I didn't know cause no one was
no one was attending to me [ah] so I just like
so I just like did it myself
ya that's about it I will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it [lah]
ya
ya
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> while while bathing I was
hello
that's call cheat
<malay>cik saya nak</malay> order
<malay>nak</malay> order <malay>suji boleh</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> usually like people sell <malay>suji</malay> that
small [kan]
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
as I was saying <malay>tadi</malay>
like while I was
bathing
I was trying to think <malay>macam</malay> like
(err) when is a good time for us to record [lah] cause <malay>macam</malay>
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that [kan]
at five <malay>masih</malay> very very very <malay>memekak</malay>
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that !huh! like the the motor and the and the cars are like
<malay>memekak gila</malay>
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
crowded here and because that time <malay>masa masa</malay> we shot at kim <malay>punya</malay> place
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tempat jin bertandang</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
<malay>yang</malay> we went to jewel [eh] I think
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
(mmhmm)
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with #irfan# #zahidah#
like all my close friends I only like <malay>keluar</malay> with the for like
once every
twice a month or something
like <malay>satu bulan</malay> [eh] no <malay>dua bulan sekali</malay> kind of thing you know
or like <malay>tiga bulan sekali</malay>
!huh!
[oh] [ah]
like two to three months
ya
by who
blanks
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>apa</malay>
give it a listen <malay>nanti lepas ni</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
yes
I think the korean industry is kind of like <malay>macam</malay>
like it's quite
<malay>apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh]
like hats off to them [lah]
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay [kan]
like
there's a castle in the
series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
and it's damn big it's like <malay>besar gila</malay> and
it looks very
real [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you know some some sets you know that it's a set [kan]
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
(err)
it's really
[oh] my god (uh) I cannot (uh) my brain is like fried it's really impressive [lah]
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big [lah] in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts [lah] [hor]
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
[eh] buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
(mmhmm)
ya ya
makes sense food
[ah] !aiya! okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
<malay>pakai yang</malay> the one that I told you about <malay>hari tu</malay> that it <malay>karat</malay>
so the reason why it's
four hundred okay so it's four hundred plus for two specs [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> it's like one for one
and then
(um) when I was buying it I was like thinking <malay>kenapa dia punya</malay>
<malay>kenapa orang nak kena ada</malay> promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
one for one specs [lah] like at at that point of time I was like thinking
[oh] it's a good deal cause like <malay>macam</malay>
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free [lah] for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so (um)
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
(err)
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was a heated argument [eh] discussion between me and my
mum and my <malay>kakak</malay> [ah]
like we were like
<malay>patutlah dia jual</malay> one for one
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> specs <malay>tak guna</malay>
like
then I was like <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [eh] cause like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that [lah] but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
your degree <malay>naik</malay> or something right
I don't know
is it just <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> to me
and
it all
like
ya
<malay>macam</malay>
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures [pe] ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
(err)
if you see [ah] the people who who buy glasses from owndays [kan] they also keep on changing their glasses
then my <malay>kakak</malay> cause my <malay>kakak</malay> was telling me [ah] that (um) celebrities who
share that <malay>dia orang beli</malay> their glasses from owndays like they keep on <malay>macam</malay> promoting owndays that means like
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and I guess that's why <malay>macam</malay> a lot of
glasses (um) spectacle shops are following following it [lah]
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that [kan] usually [ah] specs
specs shop is <malay>dekat dalam</malay> the display then you have to like engage the
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
is on display everything at <malay>macam</malay> the racks then you just take and <malay>tak payah</malay>
<malay>tak payah apa nama dia</malay>
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
like the the shop that I went to <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia dia dia dia</malay> I sound like I'm singing [oh] my god
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try [lah] so that they can sanitise [kan]
and then
while waiting for them to fix my <malay>kakak punya</malay> glasses
I was looking at like other customers [ah] and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know [ah]
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
like <malay>berani gila</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also [ah] the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because <malay>macam</malay>
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
they have to let the migrant workers work <malay>sebab</malay> of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also [lor] I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
(mm)
ya
[oh] my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
[oh] ya talking about it
ya
talking about <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (um)
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you [sia] I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like [oh] my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then I <malay>masuk</malay> then I was like what is all these two faced people
like writing
I feel like writing and radio is very two faced <malay>macam</malay>
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it [lah] ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
<malay>macam</malay> that
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype [kan]
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing [lah] like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
but then you only do a little like <malay>sikit</malay>
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like !huh! why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
but like playing with stocks are like <malay>macam</malay> gambling [ah]
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
<malay>naik</malay> or <malay>turun</malay>
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
my <malay>nenek</malay> sheryl was sharing with me [ah] that like
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
(mm)
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual [lah]
and their self control I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
!huh!
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised [lah] cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into [lah] to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
so my mind is literally <malay>macam</malay> peanut
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
<malay>macam</malay> there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some <malay>merepek</malay> content
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting [lah] cause like
they keep on
giving you
different (um)
different tiktoks everyday [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like it like within
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
<malay>nanti</malay> it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
and stuff like that and and like to reach out (err) to a bigger audience but <malay>macam</malay>
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
like I <malay>masuk</malay> also to <malay>tengok</malay> what people
no I <malay>masuk</malay> to <malay>tengok</malay> like people send me
stuff and then I'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like I I can only like I used to be able to <malay>macam</malay>
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing [lah]
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(uh huh)
maybe that's why you've been seeing #jufri#
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like
I have no idea
(mmhmm)
ya
also cause I go post
followed all your friends
ya
it's like if he if he cannot like get you he will try for your friends kind of thing you know
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
it's so weird
and when guys do that is like <malay>tak ada perempuan lain ke</malay>
like as in <malay>macam</malay>
like to me right it's like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like you already like cling onto like someone
like a family member and like people know you
and then you start to like
try everyone else <malay>macam</malay>
dude
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[oh] my god
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
I guess it's his kink or something
like indonesian girls
<malay>macam</malay> like common ya
ya
maybe they have like
an idea of like what
they are <malay>macam</malay>
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
!ee! I hate guys like that
(uh huh) like
[ah]
(mmhmm)
!ee!
<malay>suruh dia kahwin</malay> chef [ah]
and and the thing is
each like
<malay>apa nama dia</malay>
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan</malay>
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
[ah]
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
(mmhmm)
like even if they don't have
even if they don't have like long term <malay>macam</malay> five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them I feel <malay>macam</malay>
they should have at least like a one year plan <malay>kalau tak macam</malay>
what you <malay>menganggur</malay>
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like
[oh] I don't know what to do with my life I will think about it [oh] <malay>serahkan pada</malay> like #allah# and that kind of things then I'm like
where's your <malay>usaha</malay> man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
<malay>habis nanti</malay> like if if you say that
if you <malay>tegur</malay> them about it right <malay>nanti dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like [oh] you're too ya I don't deserve you you don't
I don't deserve you kind of thing then I'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
I shouldn't be like responsible for that [lah] ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
about himself
no [lah] I'm pretty sure you will find someone [lah]
maybe maybe not a #muzmatch# cause like I get it it's so hard to find
it's so hard to find guys who are like who are decent on the app like ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
ya
but that's that's so shallow though
okay I say I say that that's shallow right but I'm guilty of that also
like but but mine is in terms of height
like
did I tell you
did I tell you
the first time <malay>apa</malay> [ah]
when I when I moved to telegram [kan]
[ah] he asked me [lah] [oh] what's your height
then I was like one six three you
and then
he was like I'm one six one
then me
who was like cause like his his profile he put there <malay>macam</malay>
his height in feet I forgot how much is it [ah]
then I then I calculated
I was like [oh] he is one eight one that's tall then I was like (oo) I'm going to talk to him <malay>sebab dia tinggi</malay> and then like I can finally wear heels if I date him
and then when he said he was one six one right I was like [oh]
okay smiley face and then
and then he was like I'm joking
then I was like [ah]

I mean I will still talk to you but then like I will feel betrayed because you you lied about your height
ya it's so funny
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya I know how it feels
legit
ya
maybe like
other girls
ya other girls did it
ya
[oh] my god it's it's a technique I use to like make myself look smaller
but mine isn't bottom up because bottom up will make me look like super tall
so it's just like
like <malay>atas sikit</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> like a higher angle you know
<malay>habis macam ternaik sikit</malay>

our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay [lah] but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
(err) the jokes are more for singapore centric [lah] not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that [eh] maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
[ah] but they don't have that that that talent because #suhaimi# also can speak a bit of <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and then they no [lah] they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya [lah] but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months [what]
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it

ya [lah] I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again [ah] where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again

but now COVID don't have already [lah]
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already [lah]
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no [lah] most of them are retired already
the malay teacher [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay>
<malay>cikgu ahmad suki</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
[ah] so <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
I think somebody which
I think later I show you I think I have a picture no no not really <malay>botak botak</malay>
he's a bit a bit bald
but now as age catch up you don't really recognize him until somebody pointed out then [eh] isn't that (err) <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay> then [eh]
[eh] ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression [lah] I mean
they they have to retire [what] once they they hit their sixties
have the energy [lah]
professorship
ya [lah] I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
<malay>sayang</malay> we are the millennials <malay>sayang</malay>
yes
<malay>sayang</malay> millennials starts
yes I'm millennial [ah]
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch [lah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
even my brother is millennial
my brother #naz#
so #naz# is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation [lah]
no she she got (uh) she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot [lah] but
but if she can if she can you know (err) ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya [lah] but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation [lah] I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made (err)
make a profit [lah] but the thing is if she
ya [lah] about one point one million [lah] but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
(mm)
how much she bought it
but her one is at #simei# right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand (uh)
thirteen years ago
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand [lah]
!huh!
so just just
(uh) amber road
[ah]
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal [lah] because (err)
[oh] so new [lah]
well that's a risk
development
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
but her place second floor
what one point
[oh]
her main bedroom
[oh] cause so it's quite big [lah]
ya okay but
(uh huh)
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
#dasha# when she can save more money right
(mmhmm)
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person [what]
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more [what] if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored [lah] then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means (err) in the embassy one is paying for her living space [eh] if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I mean [kan] <malay>ini duit</malay> I mean <malay>kalau</malay>
I mean now okay [lah] maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya [lah] but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury (uh) apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense [what]
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people [lah]
say about thousand plus [ah] ya maybe [ah]
okay
if six person ya [lah] if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya [lah] make sense [lah]
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy [lah] one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy (err) is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya [lah] I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo [lah] so that
they are being sheltered [lah]
fixed condo
[ah]
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they (uh) being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but (err) when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference [ah] cause
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes (err) what drives what drives people
(mm)
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
(err) flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
(mmhmm)
how much
ya that's quite a lot
[oh] [eh] so he's the degree [lah]
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh huh)
#eton# what's a #eton#
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore [lah]
[oh]
depend on the area [lah] depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese [leh]
the vietnamese might like my friend the <malay>tuan</malay> the guy
he's (err) he knows (err) he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese (err) they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area [lah] maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence [ah]
(mm)
!huh! russia
I know a few I know a few malaysian but they they study in scotland [ah] <malay>yang irfan punya kawan</malay> scotland scotland
but is it recognized or not in singapore
(uh huh)
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
the recognition you know like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] malaysian malaysia hospital [lah]
[oh] okay and then then okay [lah]
because if not wasted [kan] <malay>kalau tak</malay> recognize and then after all the effort
[ah]
[oh] why [ah]
wasted [kan]
medicine also medicine [what]
[oh]
[oh] okay
[eh] [oh] (err) #rundy# #rundy#
#rundy# #rundy#
(uh) ireland or scotland [ah]
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand [ah]
four hundred thousand
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya most I suggest
most of them they they love like all my army friends army friends (uh) <malay>nama dia</malay> #kartik#
#kartik# <malay>dia</malay> just I just saw from facebook he
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait [ah] can remain thirteen fourteen
after fourteen years <malay>dah bukan jadi</malay> principal
most of my friends
in singapore
(mm)
I think the highest I heard is [jer] [lah]
so not not easy
but in in in
<malay>macam</malay> australian <malay>ni semua</malay> I think it's I wouldn't say it's it's easier
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback [ah]
(uh)
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge [ah]
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
I think ya [lah] because the the guys are not
are not <malay>madrasah</malay> train so they have more
no no the the
#adi# is secular #adi# is <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that he went to secular but for no #ahmad# is (err) all the way is
(err) secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
so <malay>macam</malay> like for
for the girls they
they're they're
[ah] because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which [ah] no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences [ah]
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan

we only focus more on like chemistry
ya
but not like the physics the engineering not so much [ah]
processing manufacturing so it's like more on the engineering side [ah]
like factory stuff like machines equipment like how you make how you (um)
produce the
the the food item ya ya ya ya
so basically you want to upscale it [lah]
ya so you must make sure that your process is efficient and all ya
basically <malay>macam</malay> engineering [lah]
(mm) (mmhmm)
can also or like I'm working in that company and I have to optimise the process [ah]
ya okay

fun is fun [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> (ugh)
can [lah]
[oh] [oh] I can be a food process technician R&D chemist microbiologist
but we focus more on food [lah] so if we if you compare food technologies [eh] if you compare (uh) having a food technology degree and a chemistry degree then you gonna be a chemist obviously <malay>dia orang akan</malay> choose chemist graduate right ya so it's like narrowed down [lah] ya
[ah] yes that's right ya

[a'ah] I tried my best to stay composed [lah] then after that (err) <malay>aku pun dah macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>aku tak boleh kalau orang tua dah</malay> start <malay>nangis</malay> then they started to cry <malay>aku dah tak boleh aku dah macam</malay> no no no no this this cannot <malay>dia</malay> they they the both the husband and wife started to cry while talking to my friend then
I almost I am <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> I cannot embed in this kind of situation because if I'm in this kind of situation I would end up <malay>macam tersentuh</malay> [ah] and then automatically my <malay>air mata</malay> will <malay>mengalir</malay> you know so I was like then I was like quickly (err) (err) <malay>apa tu kasih suap</malay> then after that I just say (uh)
<malay>cik takpe cik saya nak kena keluar sekejap</malay> [lah] so I went out of the room [lah] then when I went out the room
I then I just sat down outside and then I let them have their moment [lah] so they were talking and then the the the father of my friend and the mother came into the room and then they were taking picture and then there were more there was more crying and everything
and then <malay>kau tahu apa</malay> you know my mum's friend (um)
she cannot enter the room you know of my friend ya <malay>kiranya</malay> my my friend <malay>punya</malay> mum
mother [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> you know inside the room because you see [ah]
because <malay>yang sakit tu anak dia</malay> [tau] so <malay>bila</malay> so she is and then she's also <malay>sakit</malay> so when she will feel <malay>sedih</malay> you know she told me personally you know like
she she try not to enter into the room because when she see her son in that condition <malay>dia akan nangis</malay>
ya ya ya
[ah] yes yes yes that like she feel like <malay>macam anak dia akan pergi dulu</malay> you know so there are moments where when I come over to the place
and then <malay>aku dekat dapur</malay> and then the mum would would like tell me [lah] like like you know (err) the mum will cry you know in front of me and then the mum will say (err)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>takde orang</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia kesian</malay> you know <malay>aku punya kawan macam dia</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang pun yang jaga dia</malay> it's like the father and the maid <malay>apa</malay> the maid is actually supposed to be doing the house chore and on top of that help out mum you know
but but she has an additional job of taking care of my friend [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> so sometimes <malay>bila dia tak mampu</malay> to help out my friends she has to help out the mother first <malay>apa</malay> because the mother is the priority first <malay>apa</malay>
so you know at times <malay>kau orang kunyit dia mulut dia pun aku kenal pun macam minta minta minta nyawa</malay> (err) <malay>dia pun</malay> sometimes will say you know like (err)
<malay>puas hati masukkan</malay> (err) dalam <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah orang-orang tua atau rumah orang sakit</malay>
can you imagine saying that to your to your you know your mother when your mother listens to that you know how how broken she is when when you you talk like that but but <malay>dia yang sakit dia tak fikir perasaan mak dia</malay> so that's why the mother there are a couple of times already [ah] and then the mother the mother say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) she try to not enter the room [ah] because she will feel extra sensitive because (err) her her parents (err) no my friend's mum is around like seventy plus
and then like the dad also around seventy plus also so they are like <malay>macam golongan</malay> really <malay>yang orang tua</malay> [lah]
so sometimes <malay>bila mak dia nangis aku pun tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> react with <malay>aku dah macam</malay> !huh! <malay>macam mana nak</malay> what am I going to do am I gonna do I need to bring a tissue paper or what and then I just like <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>cik sabar</malay> [lah] <malay>cik cik tahan</malay> [jer] [lah]
but even the the mum also say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the mum somehow I can feel like the mum <malay>macam</malay> somehow appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [lah] <malay>macam akan cakap apa</malay> like what you tell me like (err)
an outsider wouldn't do this to to this extend to help a person but the mum <malay>macam</malay>
the mum really appreciate <malay>aku</malay> [ah] the mum <malay>macam</malay> sometimes I think the mum <malay>dia tersentuh</malay> [lah] and always look look look
look out on whenever I come come over and everything <malay>sampai dia pun nak masakkan nasi rawon</malay> [ah] <malay>tak silap</malay>
because they <malay>dia dia orang orang boyan</malay> I think <malay>boyan ke jawa</malay> I think (err) <malay>jawa jawa</malay> sorry <malay>dia orang orang jawa</malay>
the parents are <malay>orang jawa</malay> so so so <malay>nasi rawon</malay> is like a big thing [lah] so I didn't come on the day she <malay>masak</malay> cause I was just too tired then I told my my my friend [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku tak dapat datang</malay> [ah] <malay>tolong kau hari ini sebab aku penat</malay>
so the then the mum said [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cik masak</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu tapi tu</malay> [lah] (err) <malay>anak tak nas nas tak tak dapat datang</malay> I'm like sorry [lah] <malay>cik</malay> K I mean
honestly <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>nak balik</malay> [kan] in in september and october you know whenever I tell that to my friend
(uh) <malay>dia</malay> automatically <malay>dia akan sedih</malay> so <malay>aku dah macam tak tahu macam mana aku nak</malay> react then he he say to me [lah] like !hey! can you do <malay>macam</malay> online from here then I'm like !huh! how am I supposed to do online and then I mean half half of me <malay>macam kalau boleh nak tolong dia</malay>
but half of me I tell myself no I cannot I need to do something from us I mean I need to push through my studies ultimately that is my goal you know
I mean after so many years of just <malay>macam</malay> you know you know that what I mean the situation of of what you are right now <malay>macam</malay> you know feeling very lost I mean I was there last time <malay>macam kita</malay> have that conversation with beberly [kan]

ya it's true you know actually when you think about it [lah] like you you you
you you you are always constantly searching for for your soul you know something like searching (err) consider searching for something you want in your life
so so that's why I was like telling myself (err) when when comes to to my friend [lah] ya <malay>aku tak boleh tolong dia</malay> all the way but I can help him out to this extent because I tell him personally like
you know with this COVID situation it will be very hard for me to <malay>ulang balik</malay> come back because of the whole swab test (err) quarantine and everything I mean at the end of the day <malay>dia dia pun nak kena redha</malay> and I <malay>aku pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(um) you don't worry because you you ask somebody
you know the fact that you are somebody there are a lot of people who come to your aid when you when you need help because you think about it is just <malay>macam</malay>
he always <malay>dia dia selalu ingat yang</malay>
<malay>yang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>seorang yang boleh tolong dia padahal orang lain pun boleh tolong dia</malay>
then <malay>aku sudah cakap aku aku aku cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam kenapa tak nak panggil aku punya</malay> cousin <malay>setakat</malay> cousin <malay>aku dengan kau lama apa enam tahun apa</malay>
<malay>tapi dia dia macam tak</malay> [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> (err) then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> cousin <malay>aku tak</malay> take initiative and everything

<malay>kau tahu macam</malay> you are tied down to something that's why <malay>aku kalau boleh tak nak macam</malay>
I don't want to accept the money [lah] you know honestly in all honesty I don't want to accept the money but because (um) <malay>dia dah ada ni</malay> [ah] you know sometimes <malay>orang sakit bila dia niat kau nak kena tunaikan dah niat</malay> [kan]

<malay>betul betul</malay>

understood
yup you don't apply in real life situation
that's true actually it's actually quite what I mean the whole thing is quite true you know when it comes to our education system
but <malay>untuk</malay> I <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
nothing has changed [eh] over the past how many years we've been living in singapore it is still the same concept of education and everything
it's like you know like the survival of the fittest [lah]
(err) the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> study hard apostrophe
will progress <malay>kuat juga</malay> then the ones <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak</malay> progress are the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> mediocre
will just fought out in society <malay>aku masih ingat</malay> (err) I remember you know the A three teacher that geography teacher (err) he
ya ya he say (err) work hard or work in mcdonald's
[ah] now when I think about him [ah] when I think about that statement [ah] about what he made at last time [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> [eh] you mean people who are working in mcdonald's is that bad [ah] you you are that [ah] that
<malay>macam</malay> his statement [ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> sense of <malay>macam</malay> elitism you know <malay>macam macam macam</malay> how our (err) government [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> that kind of it's like the vibe right there the <malay>dia kasih</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> very similar to how the government <malay>macam</malay> how the government is like [lah] so <malay>aku fikir</malay> [eh] you mean <malay>apa yang</malay> people who don't do well or people who are just average in society I mean they they they they are not successful <malay>padahal aku rasa orang-orang macam ini</malay> they are more like happy
I mean of course they want more but they are (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> content with what they have so
<malay>betul betul betul</malay>
understood understood understood
[ah]
this is a very interesting topic to talk about okay (err) honestly before I enter with
ya ya it's [ah] we're left with like twenty minutes okay so honestly (um)
K initially (err) this is like my third (err) application to you know [ah] sorry should I should not mention the name [lah]
to but I just mention the name but never mind it's it's a it's a acronym okay so (um) so before I went there in my head I always thought <malay>macam</malay> able to [kan] <malay>aku nak belajar kat sana</malay> then I'm like I I'm like how am I supposed to cope with the system over there and everything
so it was quite apprehensive [lah] in the beginning [lah] or when I went there but after I went there I realize that the system there is very different you know from singapore cause singapore [kan] <malay>pakai</malay> cambridge [kan] and <malay>sana</malay> they have their own system [tau] [ah] for <malay>apa tu macam</malay> for how to grade and grading and everything
and then <malay>kat sana aku perasan</malay> !wah! the they're very smart you know like the malaysian is super smart [eh] we're not talking about the one in you know we're talking about every other parts of the the country you know <malay>macam</malay> ones from #sabah# with the ones from #johor#
the ones from #perak# like <malay>aku dah aku</malay> I was quite shocked you know like my classmates are damn super smart
but <malay>aku</malay> realize about them is what they lack is
(um)
they are they are very (err) examination based <malay>kau faham</malay> [kan] exam yes book smart exam examination centered
so it's like they can they are they are hardcore memorizer you know their mark their marking style is <malay>macam</malay> hardcore memorizer
and of course the system over there is <malay>macam</malay> (err) the examination is (err) it's it's it's it's very straightforward [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you the question is there you just vomit out back that's how you score but then like if you wanna talk about like (err) those <malay>yang macam</malay> (err) critical thinker
is <malay>tak banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>kat sana</malay>
the ones <malay>yang</malay> critical thinker is surprisingly is the ones <malay>yang</malay> from singapore people like me and my class and my other class and my other classmates so we would tend to ask question <malay>yang macam</malay> critic <malay>yang macam</malay> higher thinking [ah]
but because our our education system is <malay>dah macam</malay> nurture us like this [kan] but <malay>bila</malay> when we go there <malay>dia orang</malay> think <malay>yang kita ni</malay> super on [tau]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> !huh! super on [eh] not really [leh] it's just that (uh) our just that our culture <malay>macam</malay> singapore culture has trained us to be like this <malay>macam</malay> and then some more you have to understand <malay>aku kat sana aku</malay> pay <malay>enam ribu</malay> [eh]
almost to like a nine K [eh] (err) nine K of (err) school fees they are only paying one K of school fees
so every hour and every minute <malay>tu bagi aku</malay> is <malay>duit</malay> so if I don't ask the question am I not wasting my money and my dad's money
ya so so that's why that's why I feel like <malay>macam</malay> when [ah] so sometimes they they the malaysian <malay>kat sana pun bila dia orang tengok aku pun dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> they are quite intimidated [lah] even my classmate also told me [ah] <malay>yang</malay> the very first time they met me they she feels that I am <malay>aku sombong aku</malay> arrogant <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] serious [ah]
she say [ah] <malay>engkau macam poyo</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah</malay> serious [ah] <malay>poyo</malay>
[ah] <malay>poyo</malay> then I'm like but but because the way I bring myself with <malay>aku</malay> I'm not the way I bring myself is my my my my like my my <malay>kepala</malay> would be like very up and then I will look at you like bitch I'm judging you that kind but I it's not like it's not like that it's just that I have to
put up a very hard exterior [lah] because you are overseas [mah] you're like you need to hustle <malay>apa</malay> and then then
when it comes to studies wise (err)
#alhamdulillah# I would say that I am coping very well [lah] I mean during the first semester I got three point seven for my but it's during my second semester that <malay>aku</malay> drop really really bad because first I was very complacent second (um)
I the the one thing that I didn't do quite smart what I mean at the one thing that is stupid of me was I shared my own answer script
to my classmate
and then it got shared with other people you know
so can you imagine I was the one who did everything from scratch and then it got shared so I told myself (err) then I was not really focused [ah] like I still remember like the day before the exam <malay>baru aku nak belajar</malay> can you imagine

when you pay fifty dollars for the same amount of eight dollars you you have the balance is still a lot [kan] then it's like worth it [kan] <malay>padahal</malay> it's the same current it's the same rate but just different currency so honestly if you ask me whether

<malay>kalau kau fikir benda-benda ni bukankah kau buat diri kau lagi sakit</malay>
<malay>siap aku cakap dengan kau</malay> [ah] <malay>aku pun</malay> sometimes <malay>pun macam bila dia nak macam</malay> (err) intimate <malay>dengan aku aku</malay> sometimes <malay>pun</malay> I tried to <malay>elak</malay> you know because
<malay>berdosa</malay> [kan] <malay>kau orang tu tengah sakit lepas tu engkau kau engkau macam</malay> add onto <malay>ke</malay> fill onto his desire <malay>dia memang ada</malay> desire <malay>tu kita tak menafikan</malay> everyone has desire desire
but
but <malay>kena</malay> control [lah] <malay>aku pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [eh] you control [lah] you <malay>tak boleh terlalu</malay> on <malay>sangat</malay> [leh] because you never know [ah] in any <malay>bila kau orang cakap dia tengah kita tengah buat</malay> or <malay>kita tengah</malay> intimate <malay>sekali</malay> (err) <malay>tuhan tarik nyawa dia ke gila</malay>

but I always tell him [lah] like [eh] you cannot you know so back to my (err) double life so ya [lah] I mean at the (err)
I'm trying my best to just keep up with my studies <malay>kita pun lagi tiga</malay> minute correct <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>berapa minit</malay> babe <malay>kat situ</malay>
okay so <malay>aku pun tengah</malay> trying to keep up [lah] with my studies I mean I'm left with just (err) semester five six and seven so semester seven I'll be in here in singapore doing my internship
and then
I am planning to do my internship in singapore because at the end of the day I'm going to come back and and work here
I I as of now I have no intention to work in malaysia [lah] unless there is a good opportunity for me but even so (err) I did ask <malay>macam</malay> consulted over there [lah] like they say like they if you're a foreigner you are given like <malay>macam</malay> temporary contract [eh]
so <malay>aku tak nak ambil</malay> contract I <malay>aku rasa</malay> it is very risky to be doing contract work and then on top of that <malay>kau kena cari</malay> (err) <malay>rumah</malay> then on top of that <malay>kau kena</malay> settle your visa and all those shenanigans so <malay>aku cakap</malay> no no no I think I rather work in singapore so it depends on which industry I'm going to
yup
<malay>betul</malay>
understood
yup yup
but you see [ah] the thing is I <malay>aku</malay> because I'm here [mah] so I am not able to network as fast
as I'm over there so <malay>kalau kalau</malay> if you were there is is is it's easy for me to network and everything but I'm trying my best to like network [lah] and the end of the day <malay>aku pun tak</malay> sure [lah] what kind of (err) prospects I want to do
(err) whether I want to go into teaching whether I want to go into academics or whether I want to go into (err) media I still haven't decide [lah] I mean
I I see myself writing for a article in a journal you know I mean it's it's an academic journal so and the (um) I mean that's that's the thing that <malay>aku aku</malay> don't mind doing [lah] but for me to do that is like I need to go into the academic
<malay>punya</malay> sector like to become I'm not necessarily become a lecturer but maybe (err)
(err) take my master and maybe I don't know take my in language and because at the end of the day (err) in language <malay>pun tak banyak orang yang ambil apa</malay> unless you are really passionate and interested in it [lah]
so I will say [lah] in the next (err) one and a half years start starting from october
[ah] what and tails and and and then you just hope for the best [lah] but I'm just glad that my study <malay>punya</malay> period is going to be be done and over with very very soon

wish [eh]
so <malay>kalau tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself [tau] <malay>tak dia tak</malay> (err) like I don't need to put <malay>duit</malay> inside [lah] <malay>biar dia biar pakai</malay> [jer] refresh to the original amount so <malay>kalau macam gitu</malay> (err) I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good <malay>jadi</malay> like <malay>tak sombong gitu</malay> [ah]
top up [ah] top up <malay>tapi bukan kita yang</malay> top up [ah]

[oh] like how is it
<malay>tapi korang ada pernah macam</malay> (uh) fight <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
so far <malay>belum</malay> [ah] (mm) okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [kan]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan] so cannot really meet each other that much <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] but how frequently <malay>tu</malay>
twice a week
[ah] not bad [lah]
but like for me I remember <malay>bila</malay> I was dating [kan] (uh) we meet everyday <malay>sebab sama sekolah apa</malay> so <malay>kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama</malay> in the weekends so <malay>hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka</malay> so <malay>bila kahwin</malay> I also know that <malay>takkan jelak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak serik</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] <malay>dah dah</malay> come on [ah] <malay>dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu</malay> should be fine [lah] [kan]
[oh] you met the the mum
okay
[eh] <malay>panggil dia apa makcik cik</malay>
ya [lah]
<malay>lepas tu makcik tu cakap apa</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] <malay>jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tapi dah</malay> it's like coincidence <malay>ke atau memang nak jumpa dia</malay>
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau</malay> like <malay>atau tak kasi dia jumpa</malay> you
[eh]
[oh] ya ya ya [oh] <malay>dia tak tahu</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> [jer] <malay>tahu</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>asal dia tak bilang</malay>
right
ya <malay>macam</malay> why he why he like want to like keep it secret [seh]
[oh] okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you [ah]
okay so do you guys like <malay>macam</malay>
but you guys haven't fought right okay [lah]
cause they say like you know
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then <malay>kalau</malay> like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know [ah] middle chair honestly I don't know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
problem with that so far <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
[oh] [eh] <malay>apa bara api tu</malay> scary <malay>juga tu nanti kalau</malay> like if one of you all like <malay>marah habis</malay> [sia] <malay>dua-dua</malay> volcano [seh]
[oh]
so like your chinese [one] your you you're what [ah] tiger right ya tiger <malay>memang</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] <malay>bara api gitu</malay> tiger fierce
<malay>tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa</malay> so <malay>baru tiga bulan</malay> so you don't know [lah] like
I think it will take a while [lah]
one year
K [lah]
(um) I think one year okay maybe six months [ah]
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
cause for me and my husband <malay>kalau kita kita dah jumpa</malay> everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months <malay>kita macam dah tahu</malay> each other <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
like
fight that okay I did something wrong then <malay>kita orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>kita mesti cakap</malay> [ah] like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys <malay>dia sekarang sekolah</malay> right so he <malay>berapa tahun lagi</malay> [eh]
right ya so he is
[oh] he's just a normal [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> honours [lah]
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) four years so <malay>dia macam</malay>
okay <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>dia belajar apa</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [ah]
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
(mm)
[oh] first year already <malay>tak</malay> surviving [oh] <malay>rabak hancur</malay> [seh]
exam exam [ah] okay so <malay>dia sekarang</malay> end of the first year
(mm) so
if he <malay>pergi</malay> counselling the course counselling he might have to restart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
three four more years with something you don't like [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> exams means you have to study for it
(mm)
[oh]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] and he's still so young he's like what twenty five [kan] so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter [ah] ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then <malay>lagi rabak</malay> then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
I think <malay>macam dia kena fikir betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dia kalau dia nak</malay> continue <malay>ke atau dia nak</malay>
like <malay>tukar ke</malay> because like one year is still okay <malay>tapi bila dah</malay> two years <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] then I think that's when it's (err) there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay [lah] <malay>kalau nak tukar</malay> right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like <malay>kalau</malay> in in so actually <malay>kalau</malay> some people right they will (uh) come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first <malay>sebab lagi senang</malay> but you waste one year [lah] but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
(uh) (uh) so like <malay>macam gitu pun boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if you want because a lot of people <malay>kat</malay> poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like (err) some course that they don't like like engineering <malay>gitu</malay> then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma <malay>yang dorang nak</malay> and then after <malay>dorang masuk</malay> then they get to go [ah] so it for them is like (um) ya you you sacrifice one year [ah] to do what you want then so you can think of it like that <malay>gitu</malay>
but does he know what he want to do
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay so <malay>dia dah tapi dia</malay> electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff <malay>asal dia tak pergi</malay> digipen
(mm)
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
(mm)
ya I mean take a risk [ah] if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
[kan] I mean that's what I would do [lah]
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best [lah]
then (um) okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of [ah]
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly [lah] what kind of course he wants cause like
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for <malay>ada</malay> [tau] art design on media that [one] at least [ah] there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
(mm)
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
[oh] okay okay
there's a master's in (uh) lasalle
(uh) (err) east asian studies
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that [one] that time <malay>[kan]</malay> she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want [lah] so [eh] I mean I feel like
(um) I'm okay <malay>tapi</malay> I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so <malay>macam</malay> I felt like I needed to work or at least do something [ah] like not school for once <malay>gitu</malay>
ya pretty much even though like <malay>kat</malay> uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff <malay>tapi</malay> then I went back so ya then I think
I think that it's okay [lah] like
cause if you just study [jer] [kan]
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right (um) what I heard from my classmates [ah] <malay>yang dah dorang bekerja</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun</malay> [ah] at the most <malay>sepuluh tahun gitu</malay> then <malay>dorang</malay> come back to like get just get a degree <malay>dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis</malay> like an essay like how to write essay all that <malay>dorang dah lupa</malay>
ya so (um) that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it <malay>gitu</malay>
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words <malay>apa</malay>
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy [ah]
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
<malay>berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>berapa tahun</malay>
(mm)
[oh] <malay>satu</malay> [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay two years [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
when
ya
<malay>lepas kahwin</malay> <malay>betul-betul nak kahwin dulu</malay> [eh]
[oh] is there a reason why you want to like <malay>kahwin</malay> first
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
(um) in terms of stress [kan] <malay>lepas kahwin</malay> [eh] you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I <malay>kahwin</malay> and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like I felt very
(um) stressed out <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>nak</malay> our our mum she [ah] she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and <malay>ayah</malay> decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking <malay>gitu</malay> so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that [lah] I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
<malay>tapi takde apa-apa</malay> [ah] because [ah] <malay>kalau orang tanya pun</malay> I will just say [oh] my husband he's okay with <malay>apa</malay> so in the end religiously (uh) culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think [ah] so
<malay>kau siapa</malay> [seh]
so my <malay>suami</malay> is super like easy going <malay>dia faham</malay> everything I'm very honest to him
<malay>kalau</malay> I'm going to this place <malay>ke apa</malay> I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him [lah] I'm going to overnight <malay>kat tempat ni</malay> with my friends we just wanna chill <malay>kalau nak ikut ikut</malay> [ah] like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so <malay>kalau dia nak keluar ke apa</malay> with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding [lah] so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your (um)
<malay>kahwin</malay> ya
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet [ah]
but for you
(mm)
(uh)
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive [kan] then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare [ah]
<malay>macam dorang punya gitu macam majlis dorang gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
<malay>malangnya</malay> I think you want like my kind of wedding
<malay>kampung</malay>
<malay>ulam</malay> [seh] <malay>kampung kat mana ni kampung apa</malay> malaysia
[oh]
#pulau ubin# <malay>dorang nak tutup apa</malay>
#semakau# <malay>pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi</malay>
<malay>kalau nak pergi kat</malay> malaysia <malay>kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak rapat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ada tu ada</malay> [lah]
filter <malay>kau</malay> block yourself you block yourself you know
<malay>kau</malay> block <malay>sendiri</malay> but then the rental will be insane
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] (uh) then (mm) #pulau ubin# is actually quite interesting for a wedding
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
#tuas# #tuas#
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
like like are they chinese <malay>ke</malay> malay <malay>ke</malay> [oh]
<malay>takde motor takde kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>bagus kau</malay>
<malay>dia jemput</malay> [jer] <malay>semua orang tapi</malay> actually <malay>tak jemput semua orang</malay> indirectly [lah]
<malay>orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat</malay> west <malay>kat</malay> east east so <malay>dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang</malay> (uh) (um) (uh) <malay>kat</malay> #tuas# <malay>situ kat</malay> #johor# <malay>masuk masuk</malay> [ah] #johor# <malay>masuk tapi kalau kau orang</malay> (uh) #tampines# #pasir ris# <malay>tak payah datang sudah</malay> waste your time
PayNow (uh) (uh) [seh]
so <malay>dorang kat sana kat mana dorang</malay> the <malay>majlis kat mana</malay>
clubhouse
okay
[oh] okay but it such a weird place [lah] to like get a get married at (uh) at #tuas#
ya I mean if you're up for #pulau tekong# [kan]
like I'm if you're if you're up for #pulau tekong# you're up for pretty much anywhere [seh] but I think you don't want #sentosa# right #sentosa# is too touristy for me
is like you only go there <malay>kalau nak</malay> show off
[kan] like if you just want to show off <malay>cakap</malay> like you like you got a lot of money then okay [lah] #sentosa# [lah] but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore <malay>yang</malay> you can actually get
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] ya you just book the cruise [lah] you just get one cruise (uh) (uh)
then you get married in the on the water
(uh)
(uh) <malay>tapi ada</malay> timer [ah] <malay>dah</malay> reach <malay>dah</malay> reach harbourfront okay <malay>habis</malay> wedding <malay>habis</malay>
(uh) (uh) (uh) unless if unless if like you [ah] <malay>ambil</malay> the cruise ship <malay>yang pergi</malay> #batam# and back [ah] then okay got time <malay>tapi ada</malay> cruise <malay>yang sekarang</malay> they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back [lah] so <malay>kalau macam gitu susah sikit</malay> [ah]
and <malay>orang tak boleh datang</malay> like wherever they want they have to come <malay>bila bila</malay> cruise <malay>dia dah nak</malay> ship off <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[a'ah] <malay>ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil</malay> [lah] <malay>sampan kau bawa sampan kau</malay> <malay>kelakar</malay> [seh] <malay>nanti dorang dayung sampan</malay>
<malay>mesti makcik-makcik semua bising bila datang dorang cakap</malay>
!alamak! <malay>susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah</malay>
(uh) (uh) [seh]
I think at night [lah] we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then <malay>bila dah malam</malay> [kan] then we say [oh] (uh) all the <malay>makcik pergi tidur</malay> and stuff and then <malay>terus</malay> we got to the club and then <malay>terus</malay>
like like go all out [lah]
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
(uh) mocktail [lah] mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
(uh huh)
[oh] nice ya we should go there I wanna go there
[oh] okay okay okay
(mm)
ya I know
so you went with <malay>adik</malay>
okay so like what do you guys get
(uh) (uh)
brunch menu (mm)
buffet [jer] buffet [lah] buffet <malay>dia</malay> halal [lah]
(mm)
okay [lah] best [lah]
[oh] chilli crab <malay>pun ada</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then you barbecue yourself or what
[oh] K
[oh] K K ya [lah] like buffet [lah] then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
(mm) ya ya ya
[eh] but no barbecue pineapple is nice
[oh]
[oh] because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly [lah] I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
!aww! it tasted like meat ya
(mm)
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go [ah] even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like (um)
even when it was (um)
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like [eh] is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so <malay>rabak</malay> so I didn't even K I didn't even like
take them afterwards after the first [one]
(uh) (uh) but okay [lah] it was fun [lah] it was for once you get to feel like <malay>macam orang kaya gitu</malay> (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> like ya that's it [lah] but I don't know [lah] like
<malay>kalau korang nak</malay> (um) <malay>pergi</malay> staycation <malay>ke tak</malay>
I know the <malay>kalau</malay> if the #d'kranji# here is
(um)
clean certified clean certified then maybe <malay>kita boleh pergi sana</malay>
cause there is like very secluded [kan] so it's a different experience <malay>gitu</malay> like out of city life
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
[ah] [seh] or you can go with us [lah] like me and (uh) me and #hafiz# so you as in
(uh) you and me will have this share the room and then he and <malay>abang</malay> #hafiz# will share [lah]
(uh) so <malay>kita halalkan</malay> [lah]
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
[oh] so <malay>susah tu</malay> but no if they like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also [lah] then at least there's some a bit of
(uh) (uh) a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause <malay>kalau</malay> if it's two #hafizes# I mean both <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh]
(uh) (uh) so I think <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] like we we can do that but it depends [ah] like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm) january <malay>gitu</malay> okay
(mm)
ya [lah] but I mean okay [lah] we can we can always go <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is like you said [ah] must plan [lah] ya
(mm)
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay [lah] so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that [lah] obviously
really [ah]
like
how how bad is it
it is
[oh] ya the one you told me <malay>yang dia</malay>
they had like the music
(err) show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
I mean <malay>dorang pun macam orang melayu</malay> [lah] you have to understand [lah] <malay>kita orang pun macam</malay> everything also <malay>macam</malay> relax <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kita macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak ikut sangat</malay> [ah] but
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover [seh]
like even
if they they recover like if #johor# is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
ya so I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> it will be really <malay>susah</malay> for them to
to get back up
ya
and indonesia <malay>pun teruk teruk</malay> [seh]
like indonesia is <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok dia punya</malay> cases
if
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
ya like I think like
indonesia is also like quite high death rate [kan] death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else <malay>gitu</malay>
so this is very scary [ah] like <malay>lagi dorang pun</malay> I don't think they care then they are so dense <malay>gitu</malay> the the country
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures [kan] (err) then (err) but for them <malay>dorang tak ada pun</malay> I mean <malay>kita bila</malay> we needed the extra space <malay>terus kita pergi tukar</malay> expo [lah] <malay>tukar</malay> all the places that we already have <malay>tapi tak pakai apa</malay> because COVID [kan] so we use that place to (um) immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> indonesia I think <malay>susah</malay> because [kan] singapore [kan] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>asyik</malay> #kiasu# [kan] <malay>kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau</malay> indonesia <malay>semua</malay> relax
<malay>dorang</malay> relax [jer] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] #kiasu# everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
like from what it looks they are not
(mm) (uh) <malay>dorang pun macam kalau mati mati</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sakit</malay> that's their thinking [ah] <malay>dah sakit apa sakit</malay> so <malay>kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi</malay>
so <malay>dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh</malay> (uh) manage [kan] all these things [ah] so it's very hard for them [ah] like india also is very very very bad
ya india is like one of the worst I think
ya ya ya <malay>yang teruknya</malay> [kan] a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour [ah] saying that it's
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
(uh) (uh)
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it [lah]
[a'ah] but like I feel like it's somewhat true because <malay>dorang</malay> really <malay>tak kesah</malay> for the for the old people
[ah] then like <malay>dorang macam</malay> they will only like take in like patients <malay>yang</malay> have a chance of survival
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck [ah] [ah] cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like <malay>dulu punya</malay> america
ya during (um) last time when america was quite bad [kan] I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] but in india it's like that every day now
(mm)
ya
ya
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more <malay>tapi</malay> they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that <malay>kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan</malay> like
don't mess [lah] don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
ya <malay>tapi orang-orang tua dorang</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita orang dah cakap pakai</malay> mask and <malay>jangan</malay> (uh) <malay>jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak keluar keluar</malay> [lah] <malay>apa nak jadi</malay>
(uh) (uh)
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so <malay>macam</malay> (um) there was this <malay>atuk</malay> not <malay>atuk</malay> #ah pek# in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like [oh] no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
like we will just like !huh! like what what are we supposed to do you know [ah] but like <malay>kita tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad [ah]
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
[ah] luck luckily like (mm) I alighted much like (err) quite fast [lah] so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
<malay>orang tak suka pakai</malay> mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
#ah pek# together <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tak ada</malay> COVID <malay>gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang</malay> just <malay>biarkan</malay> [jer] [ah]
(uh)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(uh)
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit (uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(uh)
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do [lah] <malay>dia dah dia dah</malay> like bored [lah] I think
okay
(uh)
(uh) and just be aunties [lah]
ya ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
(uh) (uh)
ya
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there <malay>dorang tak tengok pun</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau kalau kau</malay> scan <malay>ke kau tak</malay> scan <malay>ke dorang</malay> just <malay>masuk dia kasi masuk</malay> [jer] <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> [kan] ya so it's like it's so like (uh) jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay [lah] singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not [ah] I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
(um) but because everyone has to wear mask so <malay>tak tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> so it's that's why <malay>tak ada macam</malay> transmission not so much of transmission [ah] ya
(mm)
[ah] ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like [oh] my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to [ah] ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that [kan] so (err) it's it's like already in our we already know you know like (um) the social way to like <malay>macam</malay> social responsibility [lah] ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause <malay>dah berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> going to one year I feel
ya december twenty nineteen
(mm)
that's why then I'm like also like
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain</malay> is like !wow! <malay>betul-betul rabak</malay> like but <malay>kat</malay> singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> time that time <malay>bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus</malay> [seh] ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) how how their conditions were right
[oh] my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
with soap like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa nak cuci tangan dengan</malay> soap I ask you like <malay>tak ada</malay> [seh] all the aunty [ah] wash hand only wash water can already [lah] <malay>dorang memang mesti tak pakai</malay> soap <malay>punya mana ada pakai</malay> soap [seh]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
now now they don't now they're like [ah] ya <malay>kalau</malay> tak wash <malay>nanti</malay> [eh] you never wash you never like use the soap [ah] then <malay>lepas tu baru dorang</malay>
you you really <malay>pakai</malay> the soap ya
(mm)
good things comes of it (uh) come out from it [lah] ya ya ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] like I think it's (um) inevitable [lah] like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
so the toilets are generally cleaner [ah] so like okay [ah] it's not bad [ah] (um) mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown [kan] and know france [kan] <malay>dah</malay> second lockdown
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb [jer] [ah] cause no choice [kan] ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya rather than <malay>macam kat</malay> sweden where it's like free and easy and then !wow! the death rates are like crazy [seh]
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order [ah] law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then (err) some people made a a like sarcastic kind of (err) remark it's like (err) go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this [one] they say go to hospital because they found out like
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad <malay>kat</malay> japan [lah] <malay>so dorang kena mula balik</malay> [ah] everything [lah] have to go back the mask and all that (err) I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff [lah] ya I think everywhere is still quite bad [eh] but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden [kan] <malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
<malay>tapi</malay> for me I <malay>kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat</malay> seoul garden <malay>sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kesian</malay> [seh] [ah] <malay>nasib baik dia pergi</malay> doctor
[ah] <malay>naisb baik dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] so
I mean I think <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> he got more hate than
what he should have gotten <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no <malay>dorang</malay> three tables (uh)
so there were still like <malay>macam</malay> #bergroup# <malay>tapi</malay> (err) it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around [lah] <malay>macam kadang-kadang dorang</malay> mix like you sit here I sit there <malay>ke apa</malay> mix food (err) so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the (um) the fear that they have [lah]
ya so <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
(uh)
(uh)
that time [ah]
ya ya
and <malay>dia dia sakit</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>bila dah kena</malay> COVID and the check up [oh] at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed [lah] the rules and stuff <malay>kat sini</malay> seoul garden [ah] if me I think I wouldn't say so much [seh] I <malay>diam diam</malay> [jer] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] but like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already [kan] ya so I feel like (um) he's actually good part [ah] for him to be really responsible also
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended (err) people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
like what the hell does that even mean <malay>gitu</malay> (uh) (uh) so I I was like !wow! this prime minister really wants to like (err) reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
(uh) (uh) I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you <malay>makan</malay> then I'm like but it's so like
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like (err) you you don't you can't transmit anything [lah] so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work [seh]
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more [leh] then I'm like [oh] my goodness
(uh)
this kind of like way to combat right (uh) (uh) it's like I read it I cannot forget [seh] then I keep telling people then people like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so (err) ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it [ah] <malay>bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang habis</malay> [ah] [a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> it's
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous
ya ya ya he's just like [ah] give up [lah] <malay>dah mengaku kalah</malay>
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to <malay>macam</malay> (err) cheer up the community <malay>gitu</malay> (um) it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time [lah]

okay we can start talking now [ah] so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
so one person talk then one person answer K okay so topic <malay>permulaan</malay>
okay I don't know what happen I was at home <malay>tengah keluar masuk bilik cari makanan</malay> as usual <malay>cari air</malay> then suddenly mama on the sofa scrolling her Facebook and then she say the #kranji# resort <malay>ni macam cantik</malay> let's all go stay for holiday <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>satu</malay> three day two night something like that
no she just ask like <malay>korang nak pergi</malay> farm stay <malay>tak</malay> I initially said no because it's at #kranji# and I always told her like <malay>nanti sana ada momok</malay>
I think so ya <malay>dia dekat dengan</malay> #sungei buloh# all the way [sia] I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday (um) I went to research more [lah] like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown <malay>abeh macam tak ada makanan</malay> and stuff like that [ah]
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue <malay>nya barang</malay> barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november [kan] the review was on sixteen november just two days before
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
!huh! <malay>sekarang</malay> hotel <malay>tengah macam</malay> staycation package <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]

then mama <malay>tengah kat</malay> living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like <malay>adik adik</malay> then the <malay>bibik kasihan</malay> [tau] the <malay>bibik</malay> was like <malay>saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu</malay>
then I was like I !alamak! <malay>mak aku tak baik</malay> [seh] <malay>dia terus</malay> panic <malay>gabrah depan depan bibik tu</malay> but I ended up buying a few <malay>keropok</malay> [lah] cause <malay>kasihan</malay>

<malay>sana tak ada macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the #changi# <malay>punya</malay> restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
mama wants to go for that actually
when the news came out she ask me <malay>adik</malay> do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>makan</malay> first class <malay>tak pernah duduk</malay> !alah! <malay>tak boleh</malay> fly [kan] <malay>duduk kat dalam</malay> aeroplane <malay>dapat makan pun jadi</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I told mama for the price that you pay [ah] I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I remember like I I did say that out (um) mama did say that she want me to <malay>macam</malay> take them go <malay>jalan-jalan lain kali</malay> #daya# <malay>bawa pula</malay> [lah] because like the last time she went japan <malay>macam korang bawa dia</malay> [kan] so she said to me <malay>lain kali</malay> #daya# <malay>bawa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jalan-jalan</malay> so I told mama
<malay>cara</malay> I <malay>jalan-jalan</malay> later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook [mah] mama can cook
but <malay>penat</malay> [seh] <malay>masa tu kita pergi</malay> japan <malay>banyak jalan</malay> so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
but she eat #ramen# all that
<malay>sedap</malay> but the <malay>sedap</malay> is what the cook is malaysian cook [ah] or japanese cook
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree
I never try <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on airplane before
really okay I should try
[oh] K K K ya
things to note <malay>nak kena</malay> try <malay>nasi lemak kat</malay> silk air important question <malay>nak</malay> fly <malay>tu bila tu</malay> !aiya! I hope they can find a cure for this COVID [seh]

safari kenya tanzania [lah]
I think it's tanzania because of #serengeti# national park so that's tanzania but also can [what] because you just travel south kenya on top tanzania below [mah] I think I can take qatar then I will fly to qatar and then go down
there got flight
good [lah] I don't have qatar membership
leverage on your brother

[oh] ya [a'ah] <malay>orang semua nak balik negeri</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> relax <malay>dah</malay> [kan]
they're very smart
[oh] <malay>dah</malay> thirty minutes already
talking about our own life [eh]
[a'ah] still a lot of things <malay>juga</malay>
what's the name
#darwin# interiors
cheap
[eh] that's not bad
what what size resale
four room three room
[eh] not bad twenty six K
[eh] then they hack it out then outside is what <malay>kosong</malay> [jer] [oh]
<malay>aku yang tak ada rumah aku dah bilang pasal rumah aku</malay>
five more years but like a lot of things need to be done I realise [ah] like like you need to think about okay when you want to get your loan blah blah blah cause for me I don't think I want to buy a resale [lah] I want to get a because I like the flats but then the thing is I cannot get those I have to like find sale of balance
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually <malay>macam</malay> reject reject <malay>punya kalau orang tak suka</malay> the areas [ah] the units [ah]
the units [ah] units
[ah] <malay>atas tong sampah gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya</malay> fengshui <malay>tak bagus ke</malay> yang at least the good thing is <malay>tak ada momok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> resale [kan]
<malay>yang tengah yang tengah</malay> have [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also <malay>macam</malay> cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app <malay>tu</malay> [kan] so people who live in like edgefield plains <malay>kat kawasan</malay> #sengkang# they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya [ah] <malay>macam kau masuk terus dah siap</malay>
[oh] for sure
I want like <malay>macam</malay> cement floor <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> cement floor
yours is yours is porcelain tile [ah]
it look like <malay>macam</malay> cement <malay>gitu</malay> like concrete <malay>gitu</malay>
so I was thinking of something like this [lah] <malay>macam yang penting</malay> colour grey <malay>bawah tu</malay> look a bit like cement
<malay>korang ada</malay> skirting <malay>tak kita letak</malay> skirting <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
[oh]

so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation <malay>abeh rumah dia macam</malay> minimalist <malay>gitu</malay> and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau</malay> [jer] now the <malay>kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek</malay> so that's why I'm thinking like that [ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu</malay> simple simple then IKEA [kan] <malay>macam batau</malay> furniture then after five years can throw already
they <malay>katuk</malay> very fast [eh]

try teaching [ah] <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
but that's the fun part
teaching don't get holidays [meh]
[oh] okay okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm) true [lah] then you don't have to contend with parents in whatsapp chat groups
that's why I really <malay>macam tabik</malay> [ah] those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on <malay>benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan</malay> parent <malay>layankan</malay> principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with <malay>yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar</malay>
<malay>yang kat luar tu semua habis</malay> [ah] <malay>pecah-pecah</malay>

<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau anak saudara sendiri</malay> okay <malay>tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain</malay> like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds <malay>kalau anak saudara</malay> at least the values are still similar you know <malay>kalau budak tu ada</malay> problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
last resort
actually I do like teaching [ah] I mean I was giving tuition for like what almost a decade already then I realise that I do enjoy it [lah] I I enjoyed teaching when I was like at the science centre
different [lah] from a classroom environment [kan]
each project different different thing
that's a sad thing [lah] you still have to teach like the same content
<malay>dah hafal</malay> script [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
for me tuition was different okay like <malay>macam</malay> I know that the syllabus are <malay>ajar macam gini</malay> [kan] but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different <malay>macam</malay> not say education level like <malay>macam tahap kefahaman dorang</malay> is different so <malay>macam</malay> maybe in class the teacher already <malay>dah</malay> start on algebra but the kids <malay>punya</malay> foundation is still very weak so although <malay>dorang dah</malay> sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still <malay>macam</malay> at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting [lah] for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching [ah] <malay>ada budak macam</malay> they really need [ah] physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think <malay>macam</malay> is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all [kan]
they will be like <malay>apa tu</malay> one <malay>kenapa</malay> one <malay>kenapa</malay> one plus one <malay>kenapa tak boleh</malay> one and that kind of thing
it's not stressful [leh] it's it's fun
actually it's not that hard I realise okay [lah] because for me (um) I teach budget tuition and I teach <malay>orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam</malay> more or less <malay>macam</malay> [ah] relax [jer] <malay>kau datang</malay> class [kan] <malay>dia kasi epok-epok</malay> [lah] <malay>dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu</malay> for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
<malay>tu dorang punya</malay> (um) general generally [lah] most of them <malay>dorang punya</malay> mindset is like that there are a few <malay>macam</malay> one or two who come and they say like [oh] I want my kids to get A <malay>padahal</malay> the kid is already a B student so for me <malay>macam</malay> when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid <malay>dah</malay> interested in learning automatic <malay>terus dorang</malay> A <malay>sendiri</malay> so <malay>jadi tak</malay> stress <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> stress is when you haven't start the parent <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>kepoh kepoh</malay> [lah] like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid [ah] <malay>macam gitu tu leceh sikit</malay>
<malay>ajar budak-budak madrasah</malay> [ah] <malay>madrasah</malay> kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school <malay>punya</malay> how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some <malay>makcik</malay> like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because <malay>madrasah</malay> under private school [kan]
but the kids are amazing nineteen subjects [eh] for O levels one nine
okay [what] <malay>al al-irsyad</malay> [ah] [eh] but <malay>al-irsyad susah nak masuk</malay> [eh]
<malay>sekolah tahfiz</malay> [ah]
[eh] but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from <malay>madrasah</malay> like [oh] my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
[a'ah] [seh]
okay [mah] <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] but I notice this trend [tau] <malay>macam</malay> my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education !wah! they really start planning the education route early on baby <malay>masih dalam perut dah</malay> planning [tau] <malay>nak hantar</malay> childcare <malay>ni lepas umur ni pergi</malay> this school <malay>nanti pastu hantar ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> we all <malay>orang biasa</malay> relax [ah] <malay>pergi sekolah</malay> good enough already [ah]
ya
like if I have kids it's just gonna be like just relax I will be like the general singaporean like your cert [ah] doesn't necessarily mean that you going to get a job that's very good I will be that kind of parent focus on the other things [ah]
then grow up to be farmer

and after that I finally <malay>masuk</malay> then I was like okay
ya I was thinking like I'll I'll I saved up enough money
already like I think <malay>tiga tahun</malay> in I saved up enough money then I was like [ah] I I cannot [lah] later I go later they throw me into like mono intake infantry or something cause I got tattoo so I wait first
then <malay>masuk</malay> then I like cannot do [ah] later must take
and then after that finished no money already cause I spent it all on new zealand

<malay>nanti kat atas</malay> it's a dragon <malay>tapi</malay> usually <malay>dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan</malay> the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
seriously I
I kena like <malay>tiga orang</malay> who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot

because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
or like you <malay>rasa</malay> for a shorter amount of time cause it's <malay>masuk keluar masuk keluar</malay>
well with the hand [one] it's like the person <malay>cucuk</malay> one by one slowly I'm sure it's gonna hurt more
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast [lah]

[ah]
[ah] okay
[oh] [dah] <malay>buat salah sekarang buat baik pula</malay>

I
[oh]
<malay>baik hati</malay> [ah]
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
what time you <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
ya okay [lah] that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like <malay>turun</malay>
hand over shift
<malay>tujuh setengah</malay> [kan]
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I <malay>malas</malay> so I <malay>tidur</malay> I <malay>tidur</malay> in like the they have like a mass hall but <malay>atas</malay> [ah] on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else <malay>tidur</malay> on the first floor and then I <malay>tidur</malay> on the second floor
<malay>habis naik atas</malay> like <malay>pukul satu pagi</malay> then I was like [eh] ma'am I I go sleep first [ah] then she like [oh] K K I see you upstairs

<malay>habis dia nya</malay>
night shift <malay>nya semua</malay> paramedics [dah] <malay>balik</malay> then I was like [eh] <malay>encik macam mana</malay> [sia] then he's like [ah] never mind I sign for you I sign for you
reservist
<malay>takkan nak begitu</malay> [sia] [lah]
<malay>balik</malay> on the dot [sia]
actually not really [lah] I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift I wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning [kan]
<malay>dulu</malay>
[orh] me and my friends <malay>selalu keluar</malay> eat breakfast [lah] so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics <malay>balik</malay> station [ah]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
one time we <malay>naik basikal</malay>
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already <malay>pergi entah mana nak makan</malay> [lah] or something then my friend <malay>kata</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>aku tertinggal aku ni barang</malay> [ah]
then after that we cycled back and then we <malay>masuk</malay> the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis dia orang keluar</malay> then after that the #suay suay# the is like !oi! bicycle <malay>siapa ni</malay> then I was like <malay>encik encik bukan saya punya</malay> bicycle
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
eight bicycles like parked beside the <malay>siapa tak bingit</malay> [sia]
<malay>nasib baik dia orang tak kena</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
twenty percent a quarter of them [ah] <malay>dapat</malay> shock
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
<malay>kadang kadang</malay>
no most of the time if <malay>dapat</malay> shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
[oh]
so the pulse [dah] <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
no no when was the last time the patient like <malay>dia orang sampai dia</malay> [dah] [dah] gone [kan] so like how long before that did they last see him
[orh] like <malay>depan mata</malay> [ah]
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
<malay>kadang</malay> [eh] the
when I went back reservist the medic told me <malay>sekarang</malay> they make it compulsory [sia]
all medics
<malay>kena</malay> like you you have to have the my responder app
my time it was like optional
then after that <malay>sekarang dia orang</malay> enforce like you have to download
then after that if you <malay>dapat</malay> the notification <malay>kena pergi</malay> [ah] I mean if you <malay>tak nampak</malay> then #bo pian# [lah] but
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
<malay>apa dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>apa lagi</malay> case (err) the community responder was
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
<malay>habis</malay> the this the this captain the the <malay>dia dulu macam</malay> medical officer
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
<malay>habis</malay> my my <malay>kawan nampak dia tengah belakang</malay> was like <malay>belakang selalu macam lepak lepak</malay> [ah]
then after that <malay>dia nampak</malay> the captain <malay>dia terus</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah]
my the the responder is captain [ah] then after that he told us <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> take charge of the scenes <malay>semua</malay> then I was like [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>uar uar</malay> [sia] <malay>aku</malay> give <malay>kau</malay> lesson <malay>engkau buat bodoh</malay> [jer] <malay>macam tu</malay>
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
one of my last few duties [ah] like my (err) the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate [sia] resuscitate the patient <malay>dapat</malay> we gave like I think three or four shocks
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
but the <malay>nyonya</malay> was quite <malay>tua</malay> already
then they but the I think it's because
the <malay>dia orang</malay> [dah] <malay>tolong</malay> this <malay>nyonya</malay> out of the toilet then she <malay>terus</malay> collapse so like right from the <malay>mata</malay> [ah] then they immediately call
[eh] usually cardiac arrest <malay>kalau pagi pagi</malay> [kan] it's usually a <malay>macam orang baru bangun baru bangun</malay> then they <malay>jumpa</malay> the body then it's like [dah] <malay>beberap jam</malay> [ah] so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you <malay>dapat</malay> cardiac arrest
<malay>tak boleh</malay> save [ah]
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing [lah]
and <malay>kena buat</malay> <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] that time <malay>apa lagi</malay>
(err) my last duty in like my last duty ever <malay>kena dapat</malay> call the this #ah pek# he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we <malay>sampai</malay> and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court [ah]
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor <malay>datang</malay> so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor <malay>buat</malay> you know like got a there's a pace [one] when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
to do that kind
ya
then doctor <malay>buat macam macam</malay> jackhammer [sia] don't know [what]
<malay>macam begitu</malay> then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>pukimak ini apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ini</malay> rabbit [pe] and then after that my paramedic my paramedic <malay>tengah jalan</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
[sia] [lah] <malay>dia buat apa</malay> [sia] then I was like <malay>betul</malay> in public K <malay>buat betul betul</malay>
the doctor the doctor <malay>buat</malay> <malay>sembarang</malay> then we after that we all like what the fuck [sia] the doctor you know
then he was like like
that's why like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew [kan] you will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you <malay>kena letak</malay> the [lah] the set up the set <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> the adrenaline <malay>kasi</malay> the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you <malay>buat salah</malay> you <malay>kelam kabut</malay> you don't give it to the paramedic on time <malay>kena maki</malay>
so like everybody will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I <malay>penat</malay>
ya
(err) they started right after I
I know my <malay>encik</malay> was the one who came up with the vehicles [sia] there like that was his project
as in
ya that's true
I think ya <malay>tak salah</malay> I heard they got the thing for <malay>macam orang</malay> morbidly obese
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
cause the normal the normal alpha <malay>sekarang</malay> is fucking <malay>kecil</malay> [sia] like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
(mm) the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh muat</malay>
the new alpha is freaking <malay>sempit</malay> [sia] like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite <malay>sempit</malay> already
so I think like the
plus the <malay>dengan</malay> the stretcher [kan]
like you don't need to <malay>angkat</malay> the stretcher like you just <malay>picik</malay> the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves <malay>bodoh tak nak taruh</malay> in ambulance when we actually convey patients <malay>ke mana yang sedia</malay>
<malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
wait the the guy also a medic [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
[orh] firefighter
[orh] then turn out for
[orh]
ya
actually [ah] the my last cardiac arrest case like <malay>bila balik</malay> reservist <malay>ni</malay> we also turn out with and then after that I <malay>nampak</malay> [kan]
so far <malay>dia orang asyik suruh</malay> the boy <malay>yang buat</malay> then after that <malay>yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian</malay> [sia]
the firefighting [ah]
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like <malay>tak</malay>
like <malay>lepas tangan</malay> so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment [ah] like we put in the <malay>apa</malay> tubing <malay>semua</malay>
and then after that so like free up free our hands [lah] so the crew <malay>yang buat</malay>
and then after that like I <malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> anyone wearing orange bunker gear <malay>buat</malay> so far is <malay>selalu</malay> the firefighter
like the the green the green one
[ah] [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
T shirt [sia]
what you all turn out <malay>pakai</malay> bunker gear [pe]
[ah] [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also [ah] when I turn out with them
but fun right
<malay>tak</malay> stress [ah]
(mm)
[eh] wait so were you were you the covering sec com
[oh] then <malay>nasib baik</malay> [sia] <malay>nasib baik ada</malay> the fire fight
[orh] so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge [lah]
[ah] so so if anything like the will take charge of the call [lah]
what
[ah] ya
<malay>sekarang</malay> it's that's damn short [sia] so <malay>dulu dulu</malay> during my time [kan] the attachment was like two <malay>dua tiga tahun begitu</malay>
[oh] then
[ah] I see I see
ya
[orh] they want to put people into the
[ah]
[eh] but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is [ah] high intensity
ya let me google [ah] high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
so like basically the whole and then <malay>semua turun</malay> then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is [ah] like I'm sure there's like some
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
<malay>apa</malay>
make it better
I I also don't know
ya so basically right the the people will do the and the alpha people <malay>buat</malay> the medical staff [lah] the <malay>semua</malay>
that kind of thing but ya
I heard they was like they were starting to do it
quite often relatively often
but then <malay>sejak</malay> COVID then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> fire site
serious
(mm)
then you #suay# [ah]
[eh] but #ons#
I get [lah] if you want to be #ons# but <malay>tapi ko nak kacau</malay> reservists <malay>buat apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>baru juga</malay> [ah]
[oh]
#sian# hopefully your next cycle gets better
double meaning <malay>tu apa</malay> [sia]
what the fuck
so it's basically covering the <malay>punya</malay>
workload and the
(uh huh)
[oh] so if turn out then you <malay>ikut</malay> if turn out also you <malay>ikut</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>rabak</malay>
if and turn out at the same time then how
[orh] okay
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
<malay>penat</malay> [ah]
it's like you turning out for two appliances
(mm)
and
<malay>mana siap</malay> [lah] at least you <malay>dapat</malay>
last time <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan] your <malay>tak ada</malay> you get to face
face something new
ya fun right
(mm) you you've seen how it works already [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I I guess I get what you mean [ah] but it's been a long time since I felt that [ah]
[ah] like I never
[a'ah] <malay>mampus</malay> I I [loh]
last time I remember they they ask us to download when I was in then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that I think it was during like our talk or something like that
then <malay>macam kawan pekik</malay>
sir I off duty for what want to go collapse then we were like [sia] [lah] I mean I know everyone was thinking it [ah] but you don't have to say it bro
the officer just <malay>bawa</malay> [lah] then he just continue
ya
(mm)
ya you download already [ah]
the my responder app
!huh! [oh] you need the cert [ah] to download

that's why I was supposed to get the cert
after my last refresher course
it's like every cycle they tell me [ah]

certification
then it's like it only last two years
but I already do two cycles <malay>tak pernah dapat</malay> [sia] the card <malay>terlupa</malay>

ya
then <malay>tak pernah</malay> they never give
(err)
the no [lah] it's not like we go through the full <malay>benda</malay> [lah] cause we already know how to do it what so it's basically
the only thing
is like we get tested on it like the contract indications and what not
and then they have the mannequin <malay>habis kena buat</malay> [lah] then they measure
like our our depth of compression the rate of compression that kind of thing
then if you pass then you will get by right supposed to get the cert [ah]

<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] if like if like karma were to like be served to me I think it will be like
however I actually since we're on the topic of relationship it's however like I broke up with my exes will be like returned back to me like ten times fold because [kan] like my brother in law
<malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like (uh) the way I
break up with people <malay>macam</malay> traumatising <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>dia cakap macam sikit</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>

like revenge lucky revenge [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
like god just like you deserve it yup ya ya thanks god
ya
[oh] okay for <malay>siapa</malay>
like for myself like for like anybody else [lah]
deserves karma

okay never mind I have (um)
(um) I guess
(um)
I guess my ex
I guess karma I don't know
I will give karma back to him [sia] like <malay>macam</malay>
because he was really misogynistic and really mean
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like he will say [oh] girls like <malay>perempuan tak boleh buat ni</malay> [pe] <malay>kena ada lelaki semua</malay>

like
(um) but when you think about it [kan] like it's all the boomer generation all the previous generation [kan] actually created a society that is so toxic that it makes our generation difficult to process it all because we have a lot of trauma that has been passed down
from these previous generations so I don't know about you but can we blame can we blame the millennials
and can we blame the boomers for traumatising us yes thank you very much ya no like they claim
like a workplace environment where it's like
(um) I need you to
I need you to value work and only work and I need you to do all of this for work I need to live breathe work but then [kan]
it's like it's so taxing on the mind that you don't even have like time to like breathe chill you don't like even in school right
like there is no chill you you have like (um) everyday you always got an assignment to do and then you are so like it's so
built up that you are just like when am I ever going to finish this

[a'ah] [seh] now now like (uh) <malay>sekarang tengah hujan</malay> right (uh) it's <malay>hujan semenjak pukul lima empat setengah gitu</malay> [ah] [kan] ya <malay>tapi macam dah</malay> it has it looks like the rain has subsided a bit so I think there might be a chance that we can play badminton at six
actually the weather now is like the best cause like <malay>macam</malay> it's <malay>mendung</malay> it's cooling
ya <malay>mendung</malay> (err) a bit <malay>sejuk</malay> and it's just nice weather [ah]
ya it will be hard to play badminton when it's too windy [lah] ya and if it's too slippery because right now the tennis court is a bit (err) it's like it looks very wet <malay>basah</malay> cause of the <malay>hujan</malay>
unusual superpower
(err)
(hmm) I think one of the most obvious ones would be the ability to grow money to grow money because I think (err) if I have all the money in the world I can actually help lots of people ya deep [eh]
which is what you want <malay>teleport</malay>
it is nice ya
teleport
(err) actually I I I said that because like (err) my I was watching this like interview of my favourite celebrity korean celebrity and she said that so I want to emulate it's #hyorin# [lor] #hyorin# the #sistar# [one]
so and I think is a very good (err) superpower superpower cause I think right now (um) you know with money we can actually do lots of stuff
answer politically right answer
I actually saw this (err) one movie recently on netflix right is called I boy
so the is like a sci-fi movie where (err) the story is about this (err) boy who suddenly had the superpower to actually control technology from his mind ya ya so (err) it happened (err) <malay>sebab</malay> one day <malay>dia macam apa tu</malay> he got ambushed or got chased by a group of his classmates
so <malay>dia punya</malay> classmates I mean when the group <malay>macam ada</malay>
gangster gangster <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] ya so like even though they are very young the (err) they know they they they they can handle like dangerous stuff like pistol and drugs ya so that time (uh) <malay>macam dia tengah lari tengah lari</malay> from the <malay>orang</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> (um) one of them from the bad guy actually <malay>tembak</malay>
<malay>tembak</malay> the the guy so he hit the side of his head [ah] ya so because of that he went to a coma then the doctors said that there were actually fragments of of the phone (err) in his head fragments of a phone in his head ya I know I know I know it sounds stupid [lah] but ya this what is actually what the doctor said ya so because of that he actually got a superpower
(err) to actually (um) see whatever you're typing (err) whatever you are whatever you whatever you are conversing on your phone or whatever that is phone related [lah] and he has the ability to <malay>macam</malay> technology from his mind ya so is it got it got like (err) if you think about it right <malay>macam</malay> there's a lot of things you can do if you can control technology cause technology is everywhere right now in our society which I think is very cool [lah] very cool
ya <malay>cuma macam</malay> now that the movie is he is using his superpower for others (uh) for others for his own good and to help others [lah] I mean <malay>macam</malay> so he helped to track down the the culprits [ah] so the story was (err) <malay>macam apa tu</malay> (uh) this (uh) the neighbourhood is <malay>macam ada apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam ada</malay> is run by this (err) drug drug society drug a group [ah] like (err) ya so he helped to track this group down <malay>abeh macam</malay> help the police to do so he he use his technology <malay>macam</malay> to draw them in [lah] to expose on the drugs and dark secrets <malay>dorang ada</malay> to the neighbourhood and to the police
ya so it's it's inspiring [lah] I would say inspiring movie I boy the movie title is I boy but he is a high school student high school (err) high school is it middle school I can't remember okay middle school
[orh] no no no no he's a middle school student ya he also has the ability to draw cash from bank accounts <malay>macam</malay> like (err) ya he can just drain your bank account just like that or also like (err) put in money into your bank account just like that so which is quite cool [lah] ya
ya <malay>ke</malay> [oh] is it that's nice [oh] he more like he targets the the gangsters society but <malay>dia macam</malay> he let them (uh) like he drains all of their bank accounts so that <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> resources
like to turn to [lah] in a sense ya
ya
society society is like what your school your teachers
labels
[orh] (err) usually for me I haven't been I haven't experience (err) any strong stereotypes by my peers or by my the people who I socialise with so I cannot really say much but I know that <malay>macam</malay>
there's always like (err) well known stereotypes (err) within the malay community (err) for example <malay>macam</malay> one very good example would be <malay>macam orang melayu tak pandai tak pandai</malay> in math <malay>gitu</malay> ya from young so and usually like (err) because like <malay>orang melayu suka macam lepak dekat</malay> void deck <malay>gitu</malay> so we are we are we are seen as like lazy people [lor] in a sense ya
which I think (err) <malay>palsu</malay> [lah] because like you as you grow up you will learn to take things on your stride then you will you once you find out what you like and then you will work towards it [what] it's the same for everyone <malay>cuma dulu</malay> is okay [what] to <malay>lepak</malay> cause like last time with your friends just chill chill [lah] like if if you like to me if your if your kind of <malay>lepak</malay> is <malay>main</malay> (err) like computer games or like
or like that kind then your our kind of <malay>lepak</malay> is really like is at the void deck [lah] chit chat <malay>yang main</malay> guitar ya so is the same kind of <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] I mean is just different kind of how you view <malay>lepak</malay> as
I think (err) I think it's is somewhat true [lah] because I think it is somewhat true because like (uh) if you were talking about right there's (um) the number of malay the malay population in is very little ya and some more we are already the minority like (err) there's not a lot of us (err) compared to the chinese the chinese people back in school so it's much much lesser
even though I do agree that (err) there's a smaller percentage of malay people who go to university but (err) to local universities but I know like there's actually a lot of my peers from secondary school who goes the poly then uni route so they still end up in a in a uni is just that they may have gone to (err) <malay>macam</malay> public uni [ah] I mean local uni or private uni but they still go to uni
in the end eventually ya I also have some cases <malay>macam</malay> after poly right they they (err) they do not wish to pursue university cause they already had their career settled back then <malay>macam</malay> if you look at (err) maritime studies [kan] (err) from poly (err) I think I got one friend <malay>yang macam</malay> he he he majored in maritime studies then right now he's always on the ship [one]
he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think (err) that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he (um) he is he intends to go uni [ah] because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it depends on on on the direction or the career direction that you choose [lah] I think everybody has their has their special everyone has different talents ya what what they are good at what they are bad at ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [lah]
<malay>lama</malay> [eh] it's very long
it will be a very rewarding experience
<malay>macam apa tu macam macam nak satu jam</malay> [eh]
education [ah]
subsidised subsidised heavily subsidised for public schools <malay>tapi</malay> when you talk about those non like (err) like we have certain schools in singapore <malay>yang macam</malay> the fees very expensive [kan] so usually like all the rich families will be able to go but not (err) for those families <malay>yang macam tak boleh</malay> afford [lah] because the fees are very expensive even like (um) <malay>macam</malay> if you want to join some of the you have to pay more
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity (uh) to have to access (err) to access (uh) all these various (uh) resources I think it will be nice [lah] for everyone ya not saying that (err) the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools [lah] I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
[ah] education is free for all especially when you when when we are talking about those lower income families <malay>yang macam</malay> or those like (err) families <malay>yang macam</malay> <malay>rumah tangga ada masalah</malay> (uh) <malay>mak bapa tak boleh beri</malay> (uh) <malay>tak boleh kasi apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu tolongan pertolongan kepada</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu anak-anak mereka</malay> so I think this is where it will be nice [lah] if the (err) those families (uh) those kids (um) can
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do [lah]
(mm)
ya
you do [lah] but some people just need (err) (err) a bit of that push in the beginning I feel like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> some some kids they wouldn't even think about scholarship they are not interested because they don't even have the drive in them so if you show them or like if you give them a bit (uh) of like resources a bit then they will start to see [orh] this is the reason why we should pursue such things in school [lah] so that you can have greater access then
from there they will work towards (uh) <malay>macam</malay> striving to to get a scholarship
in their head ya
equality versus
equality [ah]
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
[oh] if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
(err)
so you want the world to freeze the time
vampire
vampire werewolf okay okay if you if you (err) if you if you get to choose right will you be vampire or werewolf
but you have to eat other people for meals <malay>dahsyat</malay> [seh]
(um)
okay actually I want to be vampire also you know why cause less hair
<malay>tak berbulu berbulu-bulu berbulu</malay>
she is one in like ten
of course you can you can change him from a human to a werewolf

<malay>madrasah</malay> [lah] like I think primary two but she was like one year older than us so like is in the same class but she's just one year older then her <malay>abang</malay> also inside and her <malay>abang</malay> is like
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like I think her brothers like ninety eight I think but then we are all in the same class so I'm just like so confused like like I ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say [oh] cause like
my parents register late now I didn't know <malay>madrasah</malay> like if you register late they will put you in primary one so like you can be old and be like in primary one also
then
then I knew
I also don't know [sia] but like that <malay>madrasah</malay> doesn't exist anymore so like
I don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
<malay>naik</malay>
this is at the you know <malay>masjid</malay> #Ghufran#

#Aisyah#</P2>'s mum is actually
my mum's friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and #Aisyah#</P2> we like
grow up together [lah] like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so I was like primary two primary three
[eh] ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like I think you know [eh] it's like (um)
if me and
[oh] it's like if you and (err)

yeah so
ya ya ya ya ya then after that
[oh] my god I miss her ya okay anyway then after that right
stop laughing then after that
then (um) so like
we grow up together [lah] from like primary school <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that we go to like you know like like (um)
they have like the #macam# kids alive teens alive tweens alive
<malay>kau tak pergi madrasah</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau tak pergi madrasah</malay>
[oh] my god you Andalus child [oh] my god okay so like okay let me explain [ah] like when you go to <malay>madrasah</malay> right like at at a <malay>masjid</malay>
they used to have like <malay>madrasahs</malay>
like
let's say okay let's say you go to a <malay>madrasah</malay> in (um) <malay>masjid</malay> right like <malay>dulu dulu punya</malay> format [kan] is like <malay>madrasah</malay> #macam#
(err) it's like literal school but just <malay>madrasah</malay> like you got exam and then like got report card <malay>semua</malay> then like they band
ya ya okay so basically it's like an Andalus [lah] then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session [lah] yah so like
I think
I think like
the first few years #Aisyah#</P2> was
(um)
like afternoon session or whatever [lah] that's how I know like that's how I know a lot of people in the in the #Tampines# area who are like malays cause like I go to like this <malay>masjid punya madrasah</malay> and then like
cause you mix class every time [what] so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
(err) the primary school like when I was in primary school right they created this #macam# new syllabus <malay>abeh</malay> like is everything #macam# in english [ah] english [ah] then like #macam# <malay>tak ada</malay> exams everything is for like
(uh) you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
ya is yeah yeah so cause <malay>dia dia nak</malay> #macam# like
(um) integrated society or whatever so they so they like abolished they abolished the <malay>madrasah</malay> the <malay>madrasah punya</malay> system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a Chinese girl in our class
and then like she <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] all the textbooks all in Malay <malay>abeh dia tak faham</malay> like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the Arab cause like
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small #Kahir#</P2> inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
<malay>apa kau</malay> okay maybe cause like he learn cause like what then
like <malay>banyak melayu</malay> [kan] but then I don't know [lah]
yeah
you know that time we go to his house for <malay>raya</malay> right then his <malay>nenek</malay> ask #Kahir#</P2> <malay>siapa tu</malay> then after that he just shake shake he just like !huh! he just like shake his (um)
like shoulders then I ask you understand malay [meh] then he said
(err) I don't know [lah] but I just anyhow just give her response then she just [oh] okay then I'm just like how you speak to your grandmother like that then then after that he say [oh] [ah] usually when I go to my grandma's house right she will give me food then I'm just like (um) <malay>sedap sedap sedap</malay>
yeah it's basically ya food related
I don't know I don't even know if he knows <malay>lawa</malay>
but he listens to Malay songs now
<malay>tak faham</malay> [sia] <malay>aku tak aku pun tak faham</malay> bro just don't ask me
okay so so this Camila</P2> girl right okay the chinese girl is named Kayla</P2> then this Camila</P2> girl she
(um)
she did she got transferred out like after primary three she <malay>tahan</malay> from primary one all the way to primary three bro then after primary three right when they introduced the aLIVE thing then she transferred to aLIVE so there's like Kids aLIVE tweens aLIVE teens aLIVE then youth aLIVE so it's like technically like
(um)
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever [lah] then
then after we finish our <malay>madrasah</malay>
then me and #Aisyah#</P2> went to
Teens aLIVE
[eh]
is it Teens aLIVE [oh] ya ya ya secondary school is Teens aLIVE ya then we go to Teens aLIVE right together with her brother and then like coincidentally
(err) her mum said [oh] I put her in the Sunday class cause like confirm secondary school Saturday <malay>nak kena balik sekolah punya</malay> so I just put her in Sunday so she can go on Sunday then my mum was like yeah yeah I put her in Sunday also so like we just ended up sticking through like four plus

[oh] so much [sia] on topic <malay>ini</malay>
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor [lah] somethings like trekking [oh] my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like (um) sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
[ha]
tricky question don't know [eh] I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
<malay>kadang orang gatal</malay>
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
[oh] ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
[oh] okay okay sure
few months okay
[oh] ya then the first [one] [eh]
[oh] my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
paint <malay>tengah</malay> picnic [oh] my god that is so cute
[ah]
[kan] like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
ya [oh] my god then like the <malay>apa</malay>
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
!wah!
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
but then <malay>macam kalau</malay> the date doesn't go well I will be like bye I don't really want to share this sunset with you
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen [lah]
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
[oh] that is super rude though
[oh] then I will stand up [lah] try my best to stand up to him then like if <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak kisah pun</malay> like he is so obnoxious and so full of himself then I won't even bother [lah] I will just walk away
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
wait <malay>apa tu</malay> catfish
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
nineteen and this boy <malay>sudah gatal</malay>
ya
[oh]
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
I think I do <malay>cerita pasal</malay> dating apps or dating
wait <malay>cerita</malay> netflix [oh]
[oh] okay
(uh huh)

[oh] okay that's so fast but that's so cute too [lah]
interesting
dating dating <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>gatal</malay>
[oh]
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
[oh]
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
[ah]
[oh]
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
[oh] [kan] <malay>apa ada</malay> some <malay>cerita-cerita cinta pasal</malay>
I don't know [lah] you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
where the parents just like <malay>apa</malay> pair them pair their children up then like they their children won't know each other and and don't see each other until like the day before the engagement or something
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
(mm)
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
[oh] I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine [lah]
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya [oh] my god
twenty five sounds like a good age
then now you're twenty two you haven't really get your shit together then like
three years to get your shit that's really too fast
ya I think like twenty five sounds okay if you already have a
ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] my friends also
<malay>macam dia orang beli</malay> under the fiancee skim thing <malay>cepat</malay> [kan] then when I see it I was like [ah]
at first I was like [ah] I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like [ah] but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
<malay>tak cukup rumah</malay>
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems [a'ah] and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
nah [ah] just say they <malay>macam</malay> I wouldn't want I know that through all these <malay>apa</malay>
obstacles challenges you will go stronger [lah] and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life
[kan]
I mean like in other countries you will still be a minority too
multiculturalism whatever it is
I don't even know what that is
(uh huh)
ya but she's like [oh] okay
<malay>bodoh apa-apa apa-apa sebab</malay> [oh] multiculturalism at its best
ya ya ya
you just one way
ya have you watched enola

then I saw one (uh) caption (uh) <malay>bukan</malay> caption [ah] <malay>macam</malay> post
<malay>dia cakap pasal</malay> the politics then I think it was about this
girl this lady asking sherlock I think asking sherlock
do you saw it then I was like [oh] my god ya
ya ya ya
fits you perfectly
I was like bro damn that is like I don't need
(uh) like it's so sad <malay>macam</malay> because of all this kind of things it's just some disagreements
(mm) okay ya
ya
ya that's true that's true
(uh) <malay>kadang dia orang tak sedar diri</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam sedih</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> what can you do also
nah nah
<malay>tak kadang dia orang akan</malay> suddenly <malay>berbual pasal</malay> the privilege that we have for example the Mendaki thing and the education stuff
then like (mm) okay
(mm) <malay>kenapa orang</malay> chinese <malay>tak percaya</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
that's weird
it's so jarring to us maybe but
which suits them perfectly
it's so sad
does he saying that it does not exist [oh] my god
ya
that's quite sad
ya [kan] <malay>orang-orang</malay> chinese <malay>tak faham</malay> [lah]
then <malay>lepas tu dia orang kata apa</malay>
then we should step up more so that there will be more representation
otherwise they wouldn't hear right really [meh]
even if I step up will they hear
do they want to listen in the first place
where is the empathy right
people's action
!hais!
<malay>hidup dalam</malay> <malay>susah hati ini dalam negara ini</malay>
ya like other countries aren't any better either
right right that's the thing right
ya that's the thing like everybody keep telling me like <malay>apa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kita orang sepatutnya macam bersyukur</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita orang tinggal dekat</malay> singapore singapore <malay>bagus ada orang jaga ada orang kasi kita orang solat</malay> ya <malay>ke dia orang kasi kita pakai tudung dia orang tak</malay> we don't die just because we are muslims they we don't get shoot just because we are muslims
then like okay fine I am very grateful for that but like
why like why are you comparing our country with other countries who are even not even on par with us like we are
I don't think we should just compare countries across countries like that
ya ya that's the thing
ya
like even if they allow us to wear is like there is still this line
which is sad like sure like he just like I told you to wear [what]
then like you still treat me so differently just because I wear a #hijab#
ya like what you think I don't deserve those rights only some people deserve the rights
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]

(uh) ya ya is like so cute
[ah] <malay>tapi ada satu macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> quite I don't I don't really like it like they have this challenge on their on their house opening I was like
what I forget already there was one challenge
<malay>entah macam ada beberapa</malay> challenge
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> there is one challenge that I like

but then so cute
ya ya
you know like I at first I don't understand like why would they feel that
way like
if like you're together don't you want to marry each other then ya
that's true
maybe I will know the feeling when I
<malay>tak tak</malay> she doesn't follow me anymore yeah <malay>tak nak kecoh</malay> [sia]
[eh] do you
do you know #adam swandi# #adam swandi#
never mind then he's a local football player
he just got married
and then his <malay>pelamin</malay> is so pretty I love it
<malay>tak dia kat</malay>
<malay>kat luar</malay> some function hall or something then my friend went to his wedding then I #kaypoh# #kaypoh# <malay>tanya dia kat mana</malay>
cause it's really very nice [oh] my god and the function hall right it was so good the venue they have a space for children like I would want that because usually
malay weddings for instance usually most of the malay weddings I've went to
<malay>takde</malay> any spaces for children then like they will just run around and like that then <malay>orang akan marah</malay> and plus like it's a safety hazard for them because like there are food around hot things around and there are just so many people and so many tables around it's not safe for them so I thought
yes if I were to get married I would want to have like a children's corner for these I think it was a brilliant idea to have a children corner
then
right if I were to have a children corner you won't see the bride on the <malay>pelamin</malay> [ah] you'll see the bride
at the children corner
I'll be there
the groom was like I don't know where's my wife help me
<malay>tu tu tu tu dia tengah main dengan budak-budak</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> dress <malay>dia lagi</malay>
that's quite funny
ya
[oh] my god I was thinking of that <malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>tetapi</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> singapore's weather doesn't really allow us to do that
(mmhmm) [oh] I would want
that <malay>macam abeh tengok</malay> sunset <malay>kalau</malay> sunset <malay>dia lawa</malay> !oof! <malay>lagi</malay> best then <malay>kita boleh tengok</malay> sunset <malay>sama-sama</malay>
like the whole family <malay>tengok sama-sama</malay>
then <malay>macam</malay> at the same time I'm scared like <malay>hujan tempias</malay> even if there's like shelter ya and confirm <malay>mahal</malay> [seh] ya would you want to spend so much
on the wedding right
[kan]
like I want a small <malay>majlis</malay> [jer]
it is
their family also like to connect each other's families
that's what I told you about like what the heck
it's just it's just funny how this
weddings how this #walimas# work
[a'ah]
<malay>tapi nanti orang sedih nanti macam</malay> <malay>baiklah</malay>
like I really hope if I end up getting married <malay>macam</malay> the
my in-laws would be nice and like not pressured
I know my family won't be nice
[oh] wells
[kan]
okay <malay>baiklah itu sahaja yang kita ada untuk hari ini sesi perbualan</malay>
<malay>dan</malay> #hazimah#
<malay>terima kasih</malay>

okay can start already
good I'm good
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>bila</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> last <malay>jumpa</malay> each other
[oh] that time <malay>kita</malay>
we
video call each other [kan]
[oh] <malay>apa ni yang</malay>
was it my assignment
[oh] ya ya ya ya okay okay okay but that's not counted as <malay>jumpa</malay> [lah] because it was on google meet
was it google meet facetime
zoom zoom [eh]
because the last time we met physically was like
before COVID [kan]
that was like
many many months [seh]
and I think just because of this recording <malay>baru</malay> [lah] <malay>kita nak jumpa</malay>
<malay>kalau tak aku rasa</malay> next year <malay>baru aku jumpa kau</malay>
ya
so

<malay>macam</malay> for me <malay>leceh</malay> [seh] you know like
for me [lah] for me like <malay>kau nak</malay>
like
like <malay>kau nak kena</malay> work from home then <malay>kau kena</malay> go back office might as well just work from home [kan] because your job <malay>pun</malay> doesn't really require you to like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring [lah]
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like !alah! online [jer] [pe]
you know it's like very easy [what] you just (err) turn on your laptop and then <malay>duduk depan</malay> screen [jer]
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually [lah] my daily my daily <malay>apa</malay> (err) daily timetable will be like <malay>lapan setengah</malay> eight thirty then
<malay>kalau</malay> at most <malay>pun</malay> I will end about what five six <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau duduk</malay> in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya
ya because for me [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>aku pun</malay> I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
[eh] <malay>kau tahu tak</malay> actually [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> the thing that we are doing now right <malay>aku</malay> feel <malay>macam</malay> deja vu [tau] <malay>aku</malay> feel like
like
<malay>aku pernah mimpi pasal</malay> this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
<malay>aku</malay> feel like deja vu [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya [lah] but now (um) it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
I will make it through [lah] as always <malay>dah nak dekat</malay> final year [kan]
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] I mean
I'm trying
ya true
but you know like I feel like I've been (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> stress eating [tau]
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like <malay>macam apa</malay> (um)
buying comfort food

[eh] but I've been doing this (err) one cardio [tau]
(err) this one channel
brody (um) brody <malay>pula</malay> (err) body project
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> he the guy is very
<malay>macam</malay> very inspirational [ah] very motivational <malay>nanti dia macam dia kelakar</malay> like every time like <malay>dia dah habis dia punya</malay> whole exercise [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> last last [kan] <malay>bila apa ni</malay> cool down [kan] <malay>nanti dia kasih macam</malay> those motivational speech <malay>nanti isteri dia</malay> will be like <malay>apa</malay> [jer] <malay>apa</malay> [jer] <malay>budak ni buat</malay> cause like <malay>dia punya</malay> speech is good [lah] because <malay>dia akan cakap</malay> things like
(err) okay the fact that you have (err) chosen this (err) this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that (err) you know that <malay>macam</malay> you know he's trying to say that (err) <malay>macam</malay> well done [lah] because like <malay>kau</malay> (err) <malay>kau</malay> decides to do this workout
so
in a way <malay>macam</malay> well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause <malay>dia orang ada macam</malay> the the workout varies [tau] <malay>dia macam ada</malay> forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
then (um)
after forty minutes <malay>kau</malay> feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring <malay>macam kau</malay> feel like okay ya that's why <malay>aku</malay> take this this this whole
video
[oh] no I think
it was like six years ago but only recently <malay>macam dia orang</malay> famous I think
<malay>kau</malay> try [ah] one day ya
because recently okay <malay>aku</malay> tried <malay>macam</malay> the videos from six years ago and the videos [lah] recently

you know <malay>kau</malay> feel so tired then <malay>kau</malay> feel like <malay>macam lemah</malay>
you know so that's why <malay>aku rasa</malay> like you you have to like (um)

<malay>pergi</malay> jogging
ya but actually you <malay>macam</malay> we must [tau] because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like (um)
our health <malay>ni</malay> is really very important because recently I just bought a <malay>kau tahu yang</malay> the blood pressure <malay>punya</malay> monitor cause my mum few days ago <malay>dia sakit</malay> [kan] <malay>yang dia pergi</malay> doctor <malay>tu</malay> so she had like <malay>macam</malay> high blood pressure [lah]
it was really very high so <malay>macam</malay> (mm) the doctor <malay>suruh pergi suruh beli</malay> that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
<malay>beli</malay> [ah] then the past few days we've been checking our
then (err) my <malay>adik punya</malay> was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty <malay>gitu macam</malay> normal [lah] then my <malay>adik cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak kak tak tak</malay> (err) it is normal for me hundred and fifty <malay>lepas tu aku macam</malay> are you sure your are you sure it's normal <malay>abeh dia cakap kak</malay> I'm fat then <malay>aku</malay>
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] is it cause
for me [kan] <malay>aku aku</malay> don't really bother about this kind of thing [tau] to be honest
<malay>macam</malay>
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> recently <malay>aku macam fikir</malay> [eh] actually really [seh] I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then <malay>kau tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>muka aku ni macam</malay> this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so <malay>macam</malay>
very sucky like you know like <malay>macam kau</malay>
because you can you can really see from your your face [tau] <malay>kalau kau</malay> really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why <malay>aku</malay> these few days <malay>aku</malay> feel like (err) really [seh] I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
[ah] ya
ya true that's why [lah] <malay>aku cakap aku aku aku</malay> feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since (err) start online learning <malay>ni</malay>
cause <malay>aku</malay> feel like
to be honest <malay>macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa</malay> those facial <malay>punya benda</malay> [ah] serious <malay>aku</malay> moisturizer <malay>aku</malay> really very very very consistent <malay>sekarang aku dah macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>lantak kau</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>malas</malay> [tau] then <malay>aku sekarang</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> could feel so
<malay>menyesal</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>menyesal</malay>
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
(um)
okay [lah] maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
!hey! you sure <malay>kau</malay> step [jer] you are saying this because you are my friend
[eh] no but I actually [kan] <malay>aku</malay> feel you should like makeover [ah] your room
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
no <malay>kau kena macam letak dari sana</malay>
but what colour was your light <malay>macam</malay> is it like the <malay>macam</malay>
the orangey type or the white one
but you also bought <malay>yang</malay> the the stars thingy right the constellation <malay>punya lampu</malay>

your kindergarten is under the <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
<malay>sama</malay> [lah]
but mine was like (err) near the pioneer area <malay>sana</malay>
or maybe <malay>tak</malay> [lah] maybe we met in (err) primary school
so if we met serious primary three
[oh] my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
[oh] my
[eh] but actually [kan]
but actually
our friendship is like random
[kan] because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other [kan]
<malay>bila</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> start
close
it's always like that <malay>macam kau bila kau</malay> in the same environment with the person [kan] <malay>kau tak kau tak macam</malay> close [tau] <malay>nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti kau</malay> just randomly
<malay>pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> holiday <malay>dengan dia</malay> [lah]
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague <malay>dulu macam</malay> like when I was working with her
<malay>kita tak berbual langsung</malay> [tau] because
<malay>aku</malay> like <malay>macam kirakan</malay> assistant <malay>dia</malay> executive [lah] different roles [kan] because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder <malay>gitu</malay> so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
<malay>kita tak kita tak rapat</malay> then after I left then like <malay>tiba</malay> randomly <malay>kita</malay> because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> random <malay>tiba-tiba dia ajak aku</malay> like <malay>pergi</malay> the one the one that I went perth with
yes then
and then the funny thing is like <malay>aku pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan</malay> not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like <malay>kita tiga</malay> like considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth <malay>kita</malay> just clicked instantly [tau]
and then <malay>aku macam</malay> amazed because
!wow! you know I'm an introvert [kan] then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
it's just so <malay>macam orang cakap macam senang</malay> [ah] <malay>masuk</malay>
ya
[oh] my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay [lah] okay [lah] let's not go that direction
[oh] about my boyfriend [eh]
okay [lah] okay [ah] I think
<malay>aku</malay> just be real <malay>dengan kau</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] recently <malay>dia sakit</malay>
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay (err) what was the last time that I told you about him [eh] do you remember
[oh] okay so it's really very way back [ah] okay okay so <malay>macam macam gini</malay>
<malay>dia sakit</malay> [kan]
it was (err) before he <malay>balik</malay>
okay so he <malay>sakit tekak</malay> and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) because he's okay not only his throat [tau] then he always has like <malay>macam</malay> ulcer
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
so we tried like natural remedies [lah] <malay>macam kasih dia minum</malay> like those (um) honey lemon <malay>kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu</malay> bonjela gel stuff like that
(err) eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because [kan] he (um) because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
[kan] so like (um)
his condition kind of worsen [tau]
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him [lah] got worse
so he went back he went back home then (err) <malay>macam biasa kena</malay> quarantine and stuff like that then <malay>macam aku cakap dengan dia</malay> (err) you go <malay>jumpa</malay> doctor <malay>kat sana jumpa</malay> clinic <malay>kat sana</malay> cause first of all it's cheaper and and and <malay>kau</malay> at least like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) at least get to the bottom of it [lah] because if not you don't know what's happening [kan] because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working <malay>lepas tu dia pergi</malay> clinic <malay>kat sini pun</malay>
it's not working as well and then one thing <malay>aku geram pasal dia</malay> [kan] is that <malay>dia nak benda</malay> [kan] <malay>nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat</malay> like instantaneously [tau]
<malay>abeh aku macam</malay> [eh] come on [lah] like <malay>kau nak baik</malay> needs time to recover [kan] but <malay>dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik</malay>
where got such thing right so okay <malay>tu tak apa</malay> then he like (err)
he
but he <malay>balik</malay>
okay he <malay>balik</malay> then (um) he
he <malay>balik</malay>
and <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
he <malay>balik</malay> he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor <malay>cakap</malay>
something wrong (err) there's something wrong with his kidney
<malay>buah pinggang</malay>
<malay>buah buah buah pinggang bengkak</malay>
so
(err) he has to go for like further check up <malay>dekat</malay> (err) specialists but it will take time
for the for the for the appointment
so right now he's actually on (err) renal diet [ah] renal diet <malay>ni macam</malay> (um) less salt less sodium less potassium <malay>kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku</malay> post <malay>dekat</malay> instagram <malay>yang gambar-gambar masak</malay> it was actually for him
ya but then
I don't know [eh] <malay>macam</malay> sometimes recently <malay>aku</malay> feel like (um)
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] okay you know I'm a very
(err) okay even though <malay>aku</malay> introvert [kan] you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when <malay>aku</malay> with him <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>aku</malay>
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
but emotionally because <malay>aku</malay> feel like
throughout this whole (um)
few months [kan] it's it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like <malay>aku</malay> trying
<malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau tahu aku sakit tangan</malay>
so like
<malay>aku</malay> don't feel the support from him also
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> recently <malay>aku</malay> feel like
(mm) ya
ya because
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak cakap</malay> [eh]
like
(mm) okay
okay actually [kan] that time he asked me [tau]
<malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> [ah] he said (um) okay you know of my condition and stuff like that [kan] like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time <malay>aku</malay> was in (err) in a dilemma because
okay
okay this is very cliche but
you know how (um) because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada</malay> you get what I mean
like
like like like you said relationship
<malay>mesti ada</malay> ups and downs [kan] I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me <malay>macam</malay> do you still want to be with me despite my condition <malay>aku</malay> felt
guilty <malay>aku</malay> felt <malay>bersalah</malay> because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] because of his condition now <malay>abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia</malay>
but
okay <malay>aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun</malay> depressed [ah] maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know [eh] because you know my soft spot for my ex [kan]
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to (err) my friend
<malay>yang tadi aku jumpa tu</malay> I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I <malay>macam</malay> if I could turn back time sometimes I wish <malay>macam</malay> there are some exes <malay>yang aku</malay> shouldn't have let go
<malay>macam</malay> I should you know my <malay>yang</malay> the ex from (err) poly <malay>tu yang dia nyanyi tu</malay>
that guy
[ah] like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you know like <malay>macam</malay> I I want those kind of relationship <malay>yang macam</malay>
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my my mood
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently <malay>aku</malay> added him on (err) instagram and then like a few days ago [ah] no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message <malay>dia</malay> [tau]
but <malay>aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan</malay> message <malay>jangan cari pasal</malay>
like <malay>aku nak</malay> text but <malay>aku macam</malay> telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where <malay>aku</malay> felt like
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
[kan]
actually [kan] to think of it I think he was like my only best friend [tau]
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit [seh] double blow [ah] in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
(um) like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay [lah] I was a shitty person
then
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which <malay>aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan</malay> the third party was my recent ex
[ah]
so that's why <malay>aku</malay> like when I think about this whole thing [kan] <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>macam</malay>
I shouldn't have <malay>layan</malay> the ex man I mean I shouldn't have <malay>layan</malay> that third party
because you know you know that that time (err) during one of my (um) poly friend <malay>punya</malay> wedding [kan] we met
we bump into each other and then
<malay>aku lupa</malay> [tau] <malay>aku</malay> honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then <malay>aku</malay> introduce <malay>macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu</malay> because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I <malay>apa tu</malay>
keep like letters
pictures
cause <malay>dulu aku dengan dia</malay> okay [lah] a bit cheesy [lah] we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and <malay>aku</malay> I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know <malay>macam</malay> coupons that was my birthday like gift [lah] to him <malay>macam</malay> coupons <malay>macam</malay>
okay (um) redeem this to get a free dinner [ah] <malay>macam</malay> redeem this to get a free massage [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
there's this book that I wrote [tau] <malay>aku dengan dia tulis</malay> (err) <malay>tak kita macam</malay> okay <malay>kau tahu macam</malay> paper [kan] <malay>lepas tu kita macam gunting</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> staple [lah] <malay>tepi tu macam</malay> make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you (err) what do you want to change in this relationship then <malay>macam</malay> appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then (um) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err)
I [oh] he wrote down that person name so like recently [kan] <malay>aku</malay> look through [kan] then <malay>aku</malay> realise [oh] my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then <malay>aku</malay> was like [oh] my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay [lah] because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you [kan]
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I mean my ex <malay>yang</malay> best friend <malay>tu</malay>
(err) he was looking at me and then from <malay>dia macam dia tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam</malay>
I don't know because okay [lah] recently okay <malay>aku</malay> be honest with <malay>dengan kau</malay> [eh]
I basically I tried to flirt with him [tau]
ya online through (err) because <malay>kita</malay> friends again [what] on instagram
no
I tried to like <malay>macam</malay> talk to him and stuff like that but
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
(err) a conversation into me [lah] <malay>macam</malay> with me so <malay>macam dia</malay>
<malay>macam kita berbual</malay> then after that <malay>nanti kadang-kadang dia</malay> just seen <malay>tak</malay> reply <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay [lah] but
because I was thinking about it [lah] cause you know two of my exes <malay>aku</malay> came back to them right two of my exes and then it didn't work out [what] [kan]
then I was thinking <malay>kalau</malay> if I were to get back with this ex [kan]
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
(err) it was a not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
like I remember <malay>merepek gila ya allah</malay> I don't know it was like <malay>macam</malay> I think it was after his performance or something
[oh] wait no or was it a date
okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where <malay>kita naik</malay> [tau] he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat <malay>tu</malay>
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
<malay>abeh dah sampai</malay> #buona vista# [eh] was it #buona vista#
I think so [lah] I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
so I just left <malay>keluar gitu</malay> I just left like that
and I just leave him <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>seorang seorang</malay> and
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
I recently <malay>yang</malay> we got back I mean not we got back like I added I mean added him on (err) instagram [kan] ya ya he followed me back so
(err) <malay>aku</malay> <malay>dia</malay>
then
<malay>aku</malay> told him [lah] okay actually it was very funny because <malay>aku</malay>
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
(err) what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said (um)
can I be honest I say ya sure sure <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay>
(err) you are a very sensitive person <malay>gini gini semua abeh dia cakap</malay> (um) it's better <malay>kau boleh</malay> tone down <malay>sikit kau punya</malay> (err) sensitivity but I was reading it and I was triggered
because that's me as a person that's my personality
you know <malay>macam</malay> you don't tell me not to be sensitive but okay [lah] <malay>aku</malay> appreciate his (err) feedback
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again [lah]
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me (um)
traumatised
seriously
<malay>tak</malay> actually seriously <malay>dia dia baik</malay> [tau] because [kan] (um) but <malay>dia pun sayang aku</malay>
he's just so
<malay>baik</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma aku</malay> [jer] shitty
ya
that's why <malay>aku</malay>
that's why I said <malay>tadi</malay> [ah] I was telling myself I said you know if I could turn back time
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious [seh] I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
actually [kan] <malay>aku rasa kalau aku tak</malay> break up <malay>dengan dia</malay> [kan] <malay>aku rasa kita dah ada anak</malay> [seh] <malay>dah kahwin</malay> because <malay>kita</malay> okay [lah] ya in that book right we actually wrote (err) when to get married and stuff like that we actually plan to get married when <malay>kita</malay> twenty seven [tau] twenty seven years old so <malay>kau</malay> imagine
or at least two kids [seh] ya so <malay>sekarang macam aku dengan dia</malay> both

do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day
I asked him out for a catch up session
I mean I've been wanting to do that actually but I just telling I was just telling myself like <malay>jangan main gila jangan main gila</malay>
[a'ah] [seh] recently I've been dreaming about him that's why I asked you this question
but I think <malay>aku</malay> dream about him because I've been looking at his instagram story
(err) that time I found out he just <malay>putus tunang</malay> actually he's a very private person [tau] because that time he <malay>tunang</malay> then he didn't post his <malay>tunang</malay> face
so it was like <malay>dia tunjuk</malay> okay [ah] okay (err) <malay>yang gambar ni aku tak tak nampak</malay> because back then <malay>aku tak</malay> follow him yet but it was my friend [lah] who showed me that picture so it was like just a picture of a bouquet of flowers and a ring so ya [lah] to show that you know <malay>dia dah tunang</malay>

we thought of like (uh) let let's go get bath bombs
so everyone were very excited (uh) to <malay>mandi</malay>
(uh)
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
<malay>sebab tandas tu besar</malay>
<malay>tandas tu besar</malay>

okay the <malay>tandas</malay> is the size of a <malay>punya</malay> flat (uh) the room the room size the ya this room size
yes so the <malay>pintu</malay> then after that
(um)
after that is the bathtub
(um) the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
<malay>kita mandi kita rasa macam</malay>
<malay>orang tengah tengok</malay>
<malay>tak kita semua</malay> [ah] <malay>bilik masing-masing</malay> [pe]
<malay>kita kita</malay> (uh)
okay <malay>kau sepuluh minit kau sepuluh minit aku sepuluh minit</malay>
<malay>faham tak</malay> so
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too [lah] so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money [lah] I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
(uh) that okay that was the second night when we decided to (um) buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and (uh) my grandma
so so we shared [lah] (uh) you know (uh) <malay>kita macam</malay> (uh) <malay>takut macam kita masuk kita masuk bilik kita rasa lain</malay>
so my so my grandma my my <malay>nenek</malay> asked [lah] (uh) <malay>apa yang lainnya</malay>
my my my <malay>kakak</malay> my <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
yes
so do you know so so you you know when people say the <malay>bilik berabuk</malay>
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
so that's what been saying [a'ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
[ah]
but
we didn't think much [lah] cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
so okay <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay> and then
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me (um) what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something [lah]
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
so <malay>kita</malay> so <malay>kita semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>diam</malay> [tau] <malay>kita semua tak</malay>
(um)
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay>
<malay>tak tak</malay> share okay we didn't share with each other what happened so on the other side they also told they they told (uh) the same thing to <malay>dia punya</malay> to their to their family [lah]
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say (um)
[eh] <malay>korang tak perasan ke bilik dia berabuk</malay>
ya
we only we only shared with okay technically we didn't share with each other we bring we we went back we we tell each other <malay>kita</malay> our own family members and then after that when my parents when my when my when my mum called her sister
when my mum called her sister then
they were like like <malay>makcik makcik makcik</malay> #kaypoh#
(mmhmm)
[eh] <malay>budak budak tu pun cakap</malay>
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
we didn't know [ah] my then my mum when when we came back from work [ah] then <malay>baru</malay> [ah]
my <malay>mak</malay> my mum said [ah] [eh] do you know that [ah] you know (um) they experienced (uh) whatever you all experience you know
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
let's meet let's meet at (um) let's meet at my <malay>umi</malay> house
so <malay>dekat rumah</malay> my <malay>umi</malay>
<malay>baru kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kongsi</malay> stories <malay>kongsi cerita</malay>
ya so and then they say okay first that's why that's why my cousin was so (um) <malay>macam</malay> very persistent (uh) to get
(uh) another bed
so that the <malay>kakak</malay> so that the sister can sleep no nobody is separated from each other
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
(um) this this kind of thing [ah] ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
(um) she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually (uh) on the left
it's a big mirror with (um) a shelf and actually that shelf is <malay>berabuk</malay> already but I didn't but for me <malay>berabuk</malay> is
(um)
for me <malay>berabuk</malay>
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
(um) dusty
nothing else (um) was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall [one] the room was dusty [lah]
<malay>bilik dia lain</malay>
<malay>sebab kita sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
<malay>sampai siang</malay>
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think (uh) occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
(um) in our heart [lah] we're like
<malay>tinggi</malay> [pe] <malay>tingkat</malay>
<malay>tapi tapi</malay>
<malay>kita semua diam</malay>
<malay>kita kita semua diam sebab kita semua dah ngantuk</malay>
<malay>kita kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kita ikut</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> in <malay>tapi</malay> in (uh) <malay>dalam hati</malay> it's actually <malay>kita semua macam</malay>
(uh) this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause (uh) it was like five thirty in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed [ah]
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins (uh) she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins [ah]
<malay>punya kawan tanya dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> (uh) best
best <malay>tak</malay>
so my cousin said (uh)
best [lah]
(uh) it was fun
but we had (uh)
we had experiences
(uh) in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
<malay>dia tanya</malay>
hotel <malay>mana</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> you <malay>tinggal</malay>
[oh] (uh) [oh] <malay>kita tinggal</malay> hotel <malay>ni ni ni</malay> [ah]
[oh]
you <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>itu</malay> hotel [ah]
(um) <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] <malay>saya punya bapa</malay> (uh) <malay>sudah</malay> (uh) (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>orang-orang</malay> (uh) <malay>orang-orang</malay>
<malay>ahli yang lain</malay> so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do [ah] they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel did was
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>panggil</malay> (uh) <malay>ustaz</malay> buddha [ah] <malay>ahli-ahli ugama</malay>
<malay>untuk sembahyang</malay> [kan] the <malay>bilik</malay> to (uh) to <malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] the hotel the blessed bless the hotel
yes
so they did that (um)
so so the moment she know what that she (uh) quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google [lah]
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
(uh)
<malay>ni kali kedua</malay>
the first time
was with my family
but that [one] we actually (uh) my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room [ah] during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just (uh) king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the (uh)
front room [lah]
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
[oh] only sixteen twenty
that (uh) definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel [seh]
speaking of <malay>orang kaya</malay>
<malay>kita tak ada jiran</malay>
[ah] okay <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>setahu kita kita takde jiran</malay>
<malay>tapi kita selalu dengar macam</malay> (uh) <malay>macam kita dengar benda</malay> [lah]
<malay>kita boleh dengar benda</malay>
<malay>tapi kita tahu kita takde jiran</malay>
okay <malay>bilik kita bilik hujung</malay>
corner corner
okay the the floor
okay the okay <malay>bilik</malay> the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
so the the the hotel very big right
(uh) the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
(uh)
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like (um) kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how <malay>orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu</malay>
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
(uh) we couldn't be bothered [lah] cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
<malay>leceh</malay> [seh]
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
<malay>kita tak kesah sebab kita malas nak</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>nak angkut barang-barang kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> okay <malay>kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kat depan</malay>
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work [ah] we we we like (err) don't want [ah] we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to #krabi# if not cause of this COVID
[ah] it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
we still when when we we <malay>kita</malay> share when <malay>kita kongsi</malay> story (uh) <malay>cerita ni dengan</malay> (um)
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us (uh)
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were (uh)
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think [lah]
[eh] ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal [one]
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
the shopping mall is just down <malay>bawah</malay>
(err) given a choice I won't want to go back there
[ah]
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins
cause if I'm if I'm cannot experience it with my family my my mum who knows my mum will end up reading one one whole book of like
[ah] recite recital and
ya you told me about your <malay>kakak</malay>
ya but your <malay>kakak</malay> cause your your <malay>kakak dah tidur</malay>
the laundry room
no while waiting for laundry
ya I remember that story

<malay>ayah dulu</malay> first <malay>kerja ayah kerja apa</malay>
!wah! <malay>kalau gitu ayah kerja lama</malay> [seh] <malay>adik tak boleh</malay> imagine [seh] <malay>kalau macam kerja lama gitu</malay>
<malay>sampai</malay> about how many years [eh] <malay>ayah kerja dekat</malay> #alfa laval#
<malay>sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun</malay> !hais! <malay>macam tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh] [ah]
so <malay>bila ayah kerja dulu dekat</malay> (uh) #alfa laval# then you don't think <malay>macam</malay> maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
<malay>memang dah</malay> planning [kan] <malay>dah</malay> [kan]
so <malay>ada apa yang macam</malay> very interesting <malay>tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke</malay> like the machine <malay>dia</malay> style <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa</malay> sledgehammer
<malay>yang</malay> the the like the big <malay>punya</malay> sledgehammer <malay>itu</malay> [ah]
!wah! <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [seh] <malay>pakai</malay> allen key [jer] <malay>senang</malay> [seh]
[oh] because it's much easier [ah]
nowadays <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>banyak</malay> like really a lot of things <malay>dia orang nak tukar</malay>
<malay>jadi macam</malay> manufacturing [kan] even <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
like now my workplace <malay>macam</malay> construction [ah] <malay>pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam</malay> manufacturing
(mm)
ya ya ya ya actually true [ah] so <malay>macam dia orang</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia orang nak buat</malay> [kan] <malay>benda tu</malay> [ah] <malay>datang</malay> [jer] [kan]
<malay>terus terus</malay> in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish [ah]
<malay>ayah rasa</malay> the houses [eh] because now they actually want to do a house
[ah] <malay>yang pagar kayu tahu</malay> the whole you imagine [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the whole building
<malay>dia semua pakai kayu ayah rasa ayah ayah tinggal tak kat tempat tu</malay>
so so you it really depends (uh) [ah]
(mm) actually <malay>kalau macam</malay> they use wood [kan] <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> [ah] it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like (uh) the wood <malay>banyak tapi macam macam</malay> (uh) the <malay>besi</malay> is steel [kan] <malay>dia orang kena</malay> mine
[ah] so that's why like (uh) <malay>kalau kayu</malay> [kan] <malay>senang dia</malay> chop [jer] <malay>lepas tu dia dia</malay> process
[kan] <malay>cepat habis dia punya</malay> plank <malay>tu banyak</malay>
[ah]
<malay>sekarang macam dekat dalam</malay> news [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak cerita macam</malay> climate change <malay>ayah dengar tak cerita ni</malay>
<malay>macam dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ada [ah] <malay>perubahan alam</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia ada tukar macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula</malay> [ah] you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly [eh] <malay>tempat tu tak banyak</malay> snow
[oh] <malay>yang itu ada</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kalau macam ayah</malay>
<malay>ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak</malay> over the years [eh] <malay>yang</malay> in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the <malay>udara ke</malay> or anything like that
so <malay>ayah rasa macam tak apa</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau dia lagi banyak</malay> shopping centre then
this climate change <malay>tu kira</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh boleh</malay> adapt [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [ah] so far [ah] <malay>ayah tak tahu</malay> anybody <malay>yang</malay> got this COVID right
(mm)
so [ah] <malay>pada ayah macam yang</malay> this [ah] COVID <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>ayah</malay> think will last how long
<malay>tapi dia orang cakap</malay> (mm) <malay>dia orang cakap mula mula</malay> it comes from china [kan] because like <malay>dia punya</malay> china <malay>tu dekat situ</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang ada dia orang</malay> they like to eat a lot of like <malay>macam</malay> weird weird <malay>punya</malay> animal <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh]
[oh] so <malay>macam ayah fikir</malay> actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
(mm)
<malay>ayah baca tak yang</malay> there's this (uh) group of people [kan] <malay>yang dia orang</malay> army plane <malay>habis lepas tu dia orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang fikir</malay> [oh] never mind [lah] because it's a private plane <malay>habis dia orang turun</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas tu yang eropah punya</malay>
the europe <malay>punya</malay> people say [eh] [ah] don't come because you're from [ah] please go home
[ah] <malay>ayah baca tak</malay>
[oh] ya <malay>dekat dekat</malay> [eh] the inside of the dormitory [kan] it's really (uh) it
according to my workers [ah] <malay>dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada</malay> [ah] but unfortunately [lah] <malay>kirakan kalau</malay> you're from china [eh] <malay>yang</malay> the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix <malay>dengan yang</malay> chinese because <malay>dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya</malay> hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> is like <malay>tapi</malay> of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the (uh) sickness because if not then people will be very <malay>macam macam</malay> racist [kan] <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak</malay> [ah] actually
[a'ah]
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad [kan] <malay>macam aku</malay> I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
[oh] is it <malay>abang abang punya</malay> party
which one is this [eh]
[oh] the the <malay>khatam quran</malay> party is it
[oh] I don't remember <malay>kena</malay> check temperature actually
[oh] <malay>dah boleh</malay> clear [ah]
mineral water [jer] [eh]
<malay>tapi ayah rasa</malay> like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada <malay>benda lain</malay> in <malay>yang ayah ingat</malay> [ah] that is the worst thing than this COVID
so (uh) <malay>apa tu jadi</malay> if now [eh] <malay>bila ayah tengok macam</malay> movie movie <malay>macam</malay> zombie zombie [kan]
[ah] <malay>ayah</malay> continue <malay>tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang</malay> [kan] now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak</malay> what story is like super <malay>takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang</malay> [ah]
[oh] like like cannibalism
<malay>tapi</malay> that cannibalism is not even fake [seh] it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story [kan] <malay>dia orang macam cepat gila</malay> [kan] like the they the they run you know
<malay>orang hantu apa</malay> [seh] <malay>itu</malay>
human that
[oh] so you're actually like actually the actual human <malay>yang</malay> human <malay>yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada</malay>
so <malay>macam hantu biasa macam</malay> [ah] you can just
walk away [ah] <malay>katakan</malay>
<malay>tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah</malay> retire [kan] so <malay>ayah rasa</malay> freedom <malay>tak macam</malay>
I I don't need to care about like all this you know <malay>hantu</malay> or all these you people
so like you don't even need to think about like the basically no stress at all [lah]
so [ah] <malay>apa tu jadi bila ayah dah</malay> retire so after <malay>dah</malay> you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so [ah] <malay>apa itu bila dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>ayah</malay>
(um) <malay>mula mula</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then you said that the [kan] <malay>ayah ada kerja kat tempat</malay> glass [kan]
[ah] so <malay>dulu dekat</malay> singapore <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> factory [eh] <malay>pasal</malay> I don't think <malay>sekarang ada</malay> company glass <malay>dekat</malay> singapore
<malay>dia punya cerita semua sama</malay> [eh] <malay>kena</malay> retrenched [ah]
<malay>macam kirakan</malay> fated [ah]
so <malay>sekarang kirakan macam</malay> free and easy
[ah] then everyday <malay>bangun</malay> and then just <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>buat itu</malay> [ah] (uh) if there's planning today then just <malay>buat</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
so <malay>ayah rasa macam hidup gini</malay> all the way till the end okay <malay>ke tidak</malay>
so <malay>kalau</malay> actually [eh] <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia banyak gila</malay> technology [kan]
[ah] <malay>ayah rasa</malay> technology <malay>ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam</malay> technology <malay>ni macam</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>nak cakap</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dulu ayah</malay> favourite subject <malay>apa</malay> [eh] like when in school [lah]
(mm)
[oh] okay
so <malay>bila ayah</malay> when you read [kan] those kind of stories [kan] do you feel <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>bila dia jajah satu</malay> country <malay>tu dia bagus ke</malay> (um) good or bad
so <malay>bila dulu</malay> (uh) [kan] <malay>yayi</malay> is actually malaysian right
[oh] <malay>yayi</malay>
[oh] actually so <malay>pasal tu</malay> <malay>nyai</malay> will come to singapore
[oh]
so <malay>tapi yang</malay> that time <malay>yang yang yang apa tu</malay> the the separation [kan]
<malay>dia dia</malay> announcement <malay>ke apa</malay>
is it an announcement on
so it was actually <malay>senang gila</malay> [seh]
immigration centre [ah]
[oh] so actually you got lucky [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
so actually <malay>macam ayah pun tak</malay> march <malay>sangat</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
[oh]
actually <malay>dulu pun</malay> like when I first (err) <malay>fikir</malay> [kan] like what to do [kan] actually I also wanted to join (uh) the army
because like the army <malay>macam</malay> to me <malay>macam dia semua macam</malay> easy [ah] [kan]
[ah] then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you you you can rise up the rank and then <malay>kerja dia macam</malay> not so bad [lah]
<malay>tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam</malay> army <malay>pun macam apa tu</malay> stoning [kan] <malay>dia orang ikut</malay> the rules and then
marching what's the point [sia] ya
!huh!
[ah] <malay>macam pelik</malay> [kan] it's like what what what's it for [ah] but I mean I can maybe understand [lah] <malay>dia orang semua nak untuk buat</malay>
like you're disciplined <malay>tapi</malay> there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
[ah]
<malay>macam</malay> somehow <malay>dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu</malay> suddenly everything <malay>macam</malay> not so bad
quite positive [kan] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] you can remember the good times [ah]
[ah] it it like life is like that [kan] <malay>macam dulu</malay> like <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) that time when the <malay>adik dalam</malay> police [eh] [oh] my god [sia]
like so hot and then <malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> push up don't say [ah]
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> push up <malay>dah apa tu</malay> !wah! <malay>sekarang sekarang nak buat</malay> push up <malay>macam gitu pun tak boleh</malay> [seh] <malay>tapi dulu</malay> !wah! you know so good you know
ya
[ah] and then <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> and then <malay>dia punya</malay> army officer <malay>semua cara dia sama</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>muka kirakan semua macam yang itu</malay> [ah] yang <malay>kak</malay> #inah# tak minat
[oh] ya ya ya that guy is also before army right ya ya ya ya
so <malay>macam dia orang semua nak kena</malay> they have this <malay>macam angkuh punya muka</malay> [ah] [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [ah] maybe it's just not fated [ah] that I you know that I didn't join the army [ah] forget it [sia] <malay>tengok</malay>
[a'ah]
[a'ah] <malay>tapi bagus juga</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau hari hari pakai</malay> uniform <malay>senang</malay> [seh] like you don't need to think you wake up
ya ya ya ya ya
[ah] so <malay>macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam</malay> MINDEF [kan] so like although he's in construction [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> nothing to do with him you know [eh] whatever that happen outside [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] okay
<malay>macam</malay> MINDEF [kan] is very big so <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> if there's anything [eh] <malay>dia orang nak kena buat</malay>
[ah] in within the MINDEF itself ya <malay>dia orang mesti nak ada</malay> manager <malay>yang kat dalam yang boleh buat</malay> construction
so he's the construction manager for MINDEF [lah]
like [oh] I got no feeling #liao# no work no work also everyday I will come to work [lor]
<malay>macam</malay> ya like no feeling to scared <malay>ke takut ke kena buang kerja</malay> nothing ya
[ah]
<malay>tapi ayah dah (err) I mean like I you speak to them <malay>sekali sekala</malay> [ah] at least
[oh]
<malay>apa sal ada banyak</malay> secret <malay>ke</malay>
so <malay>mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya</malay> then (uh) too bad [lah] because like you're in warehouse [pe]
actually <malay>ayah dulu ada</malay> license <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>ayah ada</malay> license forklift [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> wasted money [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> call crane
[ah] [lah] <malay>pasal macam sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> construction <malay>kalau ada</malay> crane <malay>masuk</malay> [kan] it's like [oh] my god [seh]
like <malay>dia orang semua</malay> like you cannot even walk there and then ya
[ah] actually servicing <malay>kebanyakannya</malay> is really <malay>buang habuk</malay>
<malay>dia dia buang habuk</malay> [jer] <malay>lepas tu nanti</malay> is if if really something wrong [kan]
[ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] change part [jer] [ah] <malay>semua</malay>
ya ya ya ya it's true [ah]
maybe <malay>pun tak gerak</malay> [seh] <malay>pasal</malay> there's not much things [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay>
!huh!
ya so <malay>sekarang macam</malay> the situation <malay>dengan si</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is a bit weird [kan] <malay>pasal banyak benda macam</malay> just stop
<malay>pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>ke apa tu yang</malay> the funny thing is that <malay>yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik</malay> [ah] <malay>habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru</malay> [seh]
[ah] is <malay>aku</malay> I don't even use the <malay>baju</malay> half of the time in pyjamas <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pergi kerja pun</malay> pyjamas [ha]
<malay>dulu kirakan macam</malay> so <malay>bila ayah dah masuk</malay> warehousing <malay>tu</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ayah tak pakai itu ke</malay> umbrella
[oh] ya [ah]
!huh!
so it's like <malay>macam</malay> after you get out [kan] <malay>macam lain gila</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja</malay> actually <malay>macam</malay> technical officer is actually pretty [ah] dia dia</malay> actually quite <malay>senang</malay>
[a'ah] so <malay>itu</malay> [ah] so <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] maybe <malay>adik pun</malay> will just become a technical officer [ah]
<malay>pasal kau</malay> if like you <malay>kerja</malay> all the way construction
is like <malay>lagi senang nak</malay> check <malay>orang punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada nak buat</malay> you <malay>punya kerja sendiri</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tapi</malay> actually <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang banyak yang</malay> [ah] <malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>dia orang suka</malay> just <malay>berdiri</malay> and then <malay>suruh orang lain buat</malay> they don't want to go down themselves
<malay>itu yang masalah dia</malay> [ah] <malay>itu yang banyak yang macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> manager [ah] <malay>yang susah</malay>

my side recording
five four three two one
okay <malay>baik</malay> okay let's start the things <malay>macam</malay> how's things on your weekend
ya I mean <malay>tadi</malay> ya I had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid <malay>dia tidur</malay> all the way so my wife <malay>ingatkan dia</malay> can go to the hairdresser and then just relax <malay>kejap</malay> [lah]
you know just have a relaxing hair trim (err) hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that (err) because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before <malay>balik kerja</malay> [eh] <malay>jadi dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> one whole day just pamper <malay>sendiri saja</malay> [lah] so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this [ah] just nice also you (err) you also <malay>jadi</malay> to do all these things ya so K [lor] so everything's all right so far I think it's a peaceful day
(err) while I was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament <malay>punya benda</malay>
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these [leh] I don't think this (err) all the researchers I think it's okay [lah] to all these to talk about all these things [ah] I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
[a'ah]
exactly ya ya that's my idea <malay>pun</malay> I was also thinking about that actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya so ya I also (err) not been discussing my guys (err) all those you know my my my guys who I've been consulting with [lah] (err) those that were in the <malay>semua tu</malay>
so <malay>dia orang kata</malay> you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when <malay>kita takde benda</malay> you know like you you there's no real cove [lah]
like everybody knows <malay>kita punya</malay> reputation <malay>tapi takde takde</malay> portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event <malay>dulu</malay>
the weekly event and then just nice (err) earlier this week <malay>ada</malay> there's a league that is there's a new league a one V one that kicked off so <malay>dia punya</malay> format [eh] sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee <malay>jadi</malay> first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so <malay>kalau kalau</malay> all sixty four players <malay>masuk dalam</malay>
#prizenya# <malay>tak banyak</malay> it is seriously <malay>tak banyak</malay> actually so the total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person <malay>jadi</malay> the whole prize pool [eh] <malay>baru apa enam ratus</malay> six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get <malay>tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus</malay> dollar <malay>pun tak sampai</malay> it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league <malay>jadi kena main</malay> each other for like
(uh) (uh) god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks (err) assuming one game a week [lah]
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches <malay>jadi</malay> a a lot of the the response of the company <malay>semua tak nak main</malay> it's like [eh] it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars <malay>tapi</malay> you know like it's <malay>nak</malay> you you enter that
only top three <malay>dapat menang apa-apa</malay> and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one K or few hundred dollar it's just like not even <malay>dua ratus</malay> so <malay>banyak orang</malay> you know the <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay> [lah] all this thing [ah] so I was wondering but
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
maybe let's say like of the registration fees [kan] ninety percent these guys only did like not even half [ah] what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent <malay>tak sampai setengah</malay> of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day <malay>saja</malay> and then (err) we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves (err) ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so (err) what's that called
(um) so serious because we are our own clients <malay>apa</malay>
so you know there's <malay>kita</malay> we can just like <malay>borak</malay> have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them [ah] look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars [ah] because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time <malay>saja</malay> [lah] so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per [ah] for the whole tournament [kan] then we take just ten percent that's (uh) between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour [lah] outside [lah] now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out [lah] but whatever it is at least [eh] the whole tournament (um) one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
I I I <malay>entah</malay> [eh] I also don't know how many people have resgistered <malay>tapi</malay> the the response I get <malay>banyak orang semua semua kutuk</malay> [ah] critics <malay>semua kutuk</malay> top top white center
now <malay>semua kata</malay> you know <malay>ni apa apa benda</malay> what kind of nonsense is this you know <malay>buat apa kita main buat apa</malay> I mean we play so much <malay>habis duit sikit saja</malay> then <malay>kena main lama lama</malay> how many weeks ya [lah] <malay>ada</malay> better things to do [ah] than to just stay around and play FIFA like that for for nothing at all ya
no <malay>tak tak tak nampak lain</malay> [ah] <malay>ada apa</malay> [eh] let me see <malay>kalau ada</malay> league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
(uh) I drop it in discord
ya so
<malay>namanya</malay> D to sports league <malay>entah siapa</malay> I <malay>langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada</malay> nine hundred plus members <malay>kat dalam</malay>
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
let's see <malay>ada tak berapa berapa orang dah</malay> sign up <malay>tak ni tak nampak pula</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi nampak macam masih buka</malay> [jer] <malay>masih boleh</malay> sign up [jer]
(um) I just didn't know
[a'ah] <malay>berapa orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>berapa orang</malay> [ah] <malay>kat dalam</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya so this is one thing I saw where I noticed somebody's shared this on this (err) whatsapp community group page for FIFA in singapore so <malay>semua orang kata</malay> like
you know the this league not worth it seriously
so there wasn't even any one they say !alah! just go for the fun of <malay>biar</malay> [jer] <malay>langsung takde orang</malay> say that <malay>semua semua kutuk</malay> okay I'll I when I say <malay>semua</malay> [eh] it's literally there only like three people that response [ah] that responded
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know <malay>buat buat tak kisah saja</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
en
(mm)
ya
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya this this this D to D thing it's just like a cash grab [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>buat ni benda</malay> just (err) make a few posters <malay>bilang semua</malay> okay [eh] <malay>aku ada</malay> league [ah] you know you get thirty percent <malay>kalau kamu menang</malay> you get thirty percent
<malay>tapi</malay> fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything <malay>benda senang</malay> I think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
<malay>macam</malay> gray <malay>macam makan makan makan sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>makan</malay> all the community
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah] exactly exactly ya
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point [lah] is that social media aspect [lah] so
in terms of like I say getting the players I have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event <malay>semua</malay> [kan] minimum or I think we can do a (uh) forty a thirty forty players so <malay>takde</malay> issue <malay>langsung</malay> [ah]
but (um) the social media aspect of a one off thing [eh]
<malay>itu pun susah juga</malay> [kan] so I'm so I'm thinking at least <malay>kalau kita</malay> have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just (err) <malay>macam mana kata</malay> [eh]
(err)
every week <malay>ada</malay> content <malay>baru</malay> that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
[ah] ya
ya
[ah]
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and [ah] we we don't have anything on our on our portfolio [eh] how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm) maybe maybe who knows maybe
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
I
actually <malay>nak kata</malay> possible [eh]
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at once [ah] actually <malay>nak kata</malay> registration fee <malay>selalunya berapa</malay>
<malay>sepuluh lima</malay>
<malay>selalunya</malay>
[ah] okay all the tournaments then
because they're by community centre budget no problem <malay>untuk dia punya wang</malay> actually it's free registration <malay>dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa</malay>
so it's just my <malay>masuk</malay> [lah] [kan] but that's for the <malay>punya</malay> [lah] (um) ya but even then I still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play <malay>juga</malay> then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> for all the events (um) what [ah] who [ah] they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just <malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>bayar bayar bayar</malay> [jer] so <malay>takde</malay> registration fee <malay>takpe juga untuk dia orang</malay> ya but for us we add in [lah] as much as we want to we are we are okay with
(uh) how do I say [ah] ya we need a way to pay or displays but but I at the same time I don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think !alamak! one day registration fee <malay>sepuluh ketul</malay> and then who knows you know like I play one game and then I'm out
you know so
ya so
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way (err) let's say registration fee let's say <malay>lima ketul</malay> [lah] I I can definitely okay
(err) five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know (err) so (err) or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that [ah] we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool [eh] wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off [tau] this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
(mm)
(mm)
ya correct
(uh huh)
<malay>betul</malay>
ya okay
(uh huh)
ya
(mm)
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say [eh] we do everything for every
let's say every saturday [lah] [eh] every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get (err) thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have (um) four four prize winners
each of the prize winners (err) okay and then at least (err) total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright (um)
or we could just put it every every week (err) the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number [lah] K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
the more people that join your prize <malay>pun naik gila babi</malay>
okay [a'ah] and then like this [ah] we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool [lah] basically [lah] alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say [eh] thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
(uh) one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match <malay>kau dah menang tiga</malay> dollar
ya
[ah] <malay>duit datang balik</malay> [tau] all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match I pay you eight dollars back
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that [lah] so let me get up my word pad my notepad [ah] so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
[oh] six eight
[dah] eighty percent [eh] [a'ah] [sia] <malay>tu dah banyak juga tu</malay>
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually [ah] we can't do that maybe top eight [ah] top eight get five percent [lah]
yes
[ah]
ya get a wise five (uh) [eh]
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
soon <malay>lepas tu kalau dapat masuk</malay> to the semi final top four [ah]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
(err) so five percent each <malay>lima peratus satu orang lima peratus</malay> okay <malay>naik</malay> top four
[ah] <malay>kau dapat sepuluh</malay> percent [lah] <malay>sepuluh peratus</malay> [ah]
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent [ah]
correct so you <malay>masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>masuk</malay> quarter final <malay>sudah dapat</malay> five percent you <malay>masuk</malay> semi final you get ten percent
you <malay>masuk</malay> final up to fifteen percent
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
(err) <malay>mana</malay> percent <malay>yang</malay>
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great [lah] okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh] so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four [eh] the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright <malay>naik</malay> four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool [dah] removed
K
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(um)
ya
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent <malay>pun boleh</malay> thirty percent of the total prize pool
[eh] of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is [lah] whatever amount
there will really get people to like [eh] !siala! if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at [eh] I only pay five dollar registration fee [tau] I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
[a'ah] correct
matchmaking <malay>pun susah</malay> [ah] [ah] ya so so that's the thing [ah] then the list (uh) ya uneven
so that's it we need to have at least
(um)
ya [eh] <malay>kalau tak</malay> some people get a buy then they get their money back [eh] that's not fair <malay>juga</malay> [eh]
(um)
okay but that's why okay you (um) then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
(mm) (mm)
(mm) true also true also difficult [ah]
(mm)
thirty two fairly I think [eh] no problem <malay>senang</malay>
<malay>senang</malay> [ah] <malay>senang</malay>
sixty four possible
<malay>tapi aku tak boleh ganti</malay>
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
en
(mm)
I have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing [kan] I have another place to pitch our original league idea too but I've been holding it off (um) so that hopefully we can get our own (uh) third party sponsors [ah] <malay>takde orang akan kacau kita</malay> [lah]
so this idea [eh] is basically if I were to go to N
falls the one that is working with SCOGA [ah] cause <malay>dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat</malay> community events <malay>sendiri juga</malay>
en
my understanding is that he has his own production <malay>punya</malay> house or something like that
(err) but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
and I think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that [kan] we telling him that [eh] looked operations side <malay>kita semua dah</malay> settled everything <malay>kita dah dah fikir masak-masak</malay> and <malay>kita boleh</malay> you know <malay>bawa orang-orang</malay> confirm register <malay>punya</malay>
you know <malay>tapi</malay> the one problem [kan] that I can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a SCOGA event or is a SCOGA sponsored event SCOGA <malay>duit</malay> no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more (err) jet ideas
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them [kan] they're all out for it
that is what N #nadesan# has been saying [ah] <malay>kalau duit</malay> anything with money <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] with gaming related SCOGA budget no problem that sounds SCOGA can afford <malay>kita</malay>
his words [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so that's that's the thing [ah] we will be working you know like (uh) together with SCOGA it won't be our event [eh] technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
let me
[ah]
let me try and see if I can find (err)
(err) what's that called [lah]
SCOGA event and see how were they how they marketed it
<malay>semua</malay> ya cause ya they have SCOGA but I remember they also it's it's almost like zenway [lah] actually ya supported by SCOGA supported by zenway but organised by you know like [ah] people association <malay>entah apa</malay> community club [lah] sports club
south west <malay>ni semua</malay> so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this (err) <malay>apa dia</malay> E delta league
(err) basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
I don't know <malay>macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up [oh] okay so it's gonna be an offline event [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> venue partner [dah] sports up <malay>tapi</malay> it's (um) [ah] you know like (um) it's again [ah]
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations [ah]
so basically SCOGA [eh] in my opinion how they've been running all their events [kan] sama macam</malay> zenway <malay>sama</malay>
it's a it's a carbon copy
<malay>dia orang</malay> just <malay>buat</malay> the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides SCOGA
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then (err) this (err) will have (err) the our
our venture <malay>punya</malay> logo whatever it is [lah] [eh] we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that (uh) ya but SCOGA will definitely take a cut is one thing
what I'm afraid of [eh] is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
ya and and that's a thing even I've been talking you know I've been talking to my wife [ah] technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event <malay>dia tak suka</malay> the idea of <malay>kita</malay> (um) how to say [ah] handing over the rains to another person
<malay>dia nak kita</malay> hundred percent <malay>seratus peratus ni</malay> event <malay>kita bukan orang lain punya</malay> this is ours have our name over there for and then of this (uh)
you know <malay>orang lain tak boleh kacau</malay> [ah] <malay>senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau</malay>
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about [lah] like
(err) like (um) even when I I told her the idea look [ah] why not (err) we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these [tau] she want us to be on our own
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner <malay>kita</malay> sure but it's not <malay>kita</malay> joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event [tau]
then they'll be like <malay>mana nama kau aku nampak nama</malay> SCOGA [jer] <malay>nama kau mana</malay>
I said [oh] now we work under SCOGA <malay>mana bukti</malay>
<malay>kita tak tahu</malay> SCOGA <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> you know we cannot we have to take you at your word I don't know about that but if <malay>kalau kita boleh tunjuk</malay> on a poster that has our logo on it
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african [lah]
<malay>dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa</malay> [ah] they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what [ah] (err) we are not not just mere partners or whatever <malay>kita tak buat apa-apa</malay> but
<malay>kita yang</malay> run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with SCOGA with [ah] whoever but they have to be partners it's not <malay>kita</malay> join <malay>dia orang</malay> we work under their name
that's the number one thing [ah]
yes
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor [lah]
a
[ah]
<malay>satu orang kena</malay> start <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] <malay>senang kata</malay>
[ah]
<malay>tu tu yang</malay> <malay>juga</malay> [eh] that
and then why I also <malay>tak nak</malay> like you I know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know I can put you can put your own money inside <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> there there would seem a little bit of a chip [ah] then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor <malay>kata</malay> okay so <malay>siapa yang</malay> sponsor your previous event (uh) and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
I <malay>tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>ini kau punya</malay> company <malay>apa</malay>
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible (um) you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all [lah] you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
(err) potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
(um)
ya ya correct
a
[ah] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>tu yang</malay> problem <malay>juga</malay>
(uh huh)
a
but I think I would okay <malay>nak kata</malay> our community [eh] okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like (um)
you will have your own you know shout out [lah] you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising [ah] a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events [eh] is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they (err) how to say that the
I <malay>macam mana nak kata</malay> (uh) <malay>ada orang kata</malay> a lot of times at people sponsor <malay>benda</malay> [kan] they don't actually get anything much out of it
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer [lah] in a way [lah]
it's the same as advertisement [ah] so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
(mm) but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head [eh] I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact is it junior football academy
junior <malay>apa</malay> junior what
football school sorry about that sorry about that so okay (err) so we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about you know
let's put aside the fact it belongs to us [lah] okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
(mm)
yup (mm) (mm) (mm)
so
[ha] [ha]
[a'ah] [sia]
!alamak!
!alamak!
okay
okay
I think ya I think in the end <malay>tu nak buat</malay> sponsor tag [ah] in the end
ya
you know <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I don't even know how to sponsor that looks like I've never seen one before though so I don't know what to base it on
okay
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now <malay>dekat</malay> facebook [eh] all the videos [kan] it will show how many views <malay>ada ada ada</malay> rather it will show how many views actually
[ah] what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>itu semua tak ada</malay> (um) ya even okay right now zenway is live right now <malay>sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok</malay> some mobile legends <malay>punya benda</malay>
ya but I don't see any total views <malay>belum lagi belum lagi</malay> total views but let's see if I can load a previous show
previous show <malay>berapa</malay> [eh] let me see another video
(um)
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the problem my my midnight <malay>punya</malay> shows [ah]
there's another
[ah] correct correct so but I can I can load I can load one and one play E sports [lah]
one play E sports
one play sports videos the problem with <malay>semua malam-malam betul</malay> [ah] <malay>paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang</malay> #problemnya#
<malay>ada ada orang</malay> but it's not that much [ah] okay ya I'm looking here
(mm) asia champions league <malay>semalam</malay> nine hundred views (err) asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
pure (err) pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
(mm)
ya the singapore premier league a week ago (err) three point eight K views
one hour <malay>juga ni semua</malay> one our cast
(mm)
but that was the the very first <malay>punya</malay> [lah] I mean like it was the first
(err) what's that called
okay E #singa# cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
(err) E #singa# cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs [ah]
<malay>ramai juga</malay>
for the one V one E #singa# cup
one V one E #singa# cup
[oh] they split it into
the whole league
(err) but they split it into different parts [ah] <malay>macam</malay> part one first two hours ten ten K views
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands [ah] early thousands
you know so ya
quite quite a bit this four [lah] but then again [eh] E sports <malay>ada berapa berapa</malay> followers <malay>ni</malay> E sports how many followers
[oh] shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
[ah]
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel (err) you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
#aiman# will help out also and in fact if at all possible I would like to ask <malay>iman pun</malay> can we stream it on your stream
ya that would that would really help
because [eh] if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just (err) #aiman# giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then (err) what's that called [ah] ya and then like this [ah] people will be alerted
or even better if we can get we can rope #aiman# in as a commentator <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
ya
exactly
[ah] correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because [ah] I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
you know I I can we make but then fees and all that [lah] like how [sia] <malay>macam mana aku nak</malay> you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why I'm not opening it to outside singaporeans I don't how to send prize money to you
[ah]
<malay>jadi kalau kalau</malay> if there's a way [eh] for us to go meet #aiman# I'm very sure he will love to work with us and I think <malay>kalau kita bilang dia</malay> look <malay>kita ini kita semua</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> will <malay>ini kita punya</malay> event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money [ah] so maybe <malay>kalau dia dengar tu</malay> [eh] the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now <malay>dia ada banyak banyak</malay> event [kan]
<malay>jadi kalau kalau</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>dia banyak</malay> events [ah] so I don't know what he was bitching to us about [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> honestly I was like dude <malay>ini</malay> it like it [ah] I look I know you're disappointed E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia of fucking meeting [ah] (err) bullshit I just said [ah] sorry
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity [ah] you're winning quantity wise those two guys [eh] other than E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia <malay>apa lain dengan</malay> other <malay>dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay>
<malay>tak tak takde benda</malay> [sia] I can't I [ah]
okay I know that (err) see <malay>siapa ni</malay> matthew [eh] has (uh) has (uh) some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing <malay>dari bola</malay> [tau] so you know [ah] [oh] <malay>kalau nak kata</malay> streaming <malay>bola</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia orang takde benda</malay> [sia] decipher <malay>lagi takde benda</malay> at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher <malay>langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa</malay> [tau]
so ya so he said [oh] I lost out to them honestly [ah] it's just connections [ah] you lost [tau] on connections [ah] that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this E <malay>piala</malay> malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
a
ya
(um)
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
because I know he's been doing singapore events <malay>juga</malay>
you know and all we want [eh] it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our #chapalang# event <malay>tak ada</malay> sponsor <malay>takde apa takde benda</malay>
us <malay>sepuluh ribu</malay> views [tau]
or whatever we can (uh) we can get [lah] we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
[ah] ya so
(mm)
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who #sekaiichi# is [ah] they just look at pure viewership numbers [ah] we can talk about them [eh] we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
you know (err) ya I also can tell it you know [ah] definitely when I when I let know of my community (err) this this affinity whatsapp group <malay>semua</malay> that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
[ah]
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because (um) and you know really likes to work together with me [lah] basically [lah]
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA [lah] so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block <malay>kita ada</malay> [ah] <malay>aku aku pun tak tak takde</malay> ideas [ah] <malay>apa nak buat</malay> like to find my own third party sponsor <malay>semua takde</malay> idea <malay>langsung</malay> [ah]
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or (err) what [ah] <malay>macam macam kau dan aku yang yang</malay> my friend #hafiz# the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that [kan]
<malay>dia kerja</malay>
I broached either to him by [eh] <malay>nak</malay> sponsor <malay>kita tak</malay> you know this sort of event then <malay>kalau kau betul-betul</malay> managed to get them in [eh] <malay>aku bagi kau</malay> you know some some credit or whatever [lah] some kickback [lah] so <malay>dia kata</malay>
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage <malay>dia orang tak langsung tak</malay> support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
okay so
officially [eh] looking at their website [eh] <malay>dia kata</malay> [ah] they are a youth non profit organisation
<malay>kalau nak</malay> under official words [ah]
(um) ya they have (err) few initiatives [lah] all this (err) E sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya (err) and they let see <malay>apa lagi dia orang ada</malay> [eh] about us
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
(uh) ya so <malay>apa ni</malay> executive committee
who do they have
nicholas aaron #khoo# <malay>macam</malay> familiar [jer] <malay>nama tu</malay>

<malay>dah</malay> start [lah] then you just continue talking

cannot bring herself
like my mother like that (mm) (hmm)
(err) <malay>lemak cili padi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>kak</malay> #zarina# is the one <malay>yang kita pergi rumah dia</malay> [kan]

#iyan# <malay>punya</malay> shoes
[ah] slippers slippers that's the one
ya <malay>dia</malay> (um) story <malay>dia</malay> (um) painted [lah] like those art jamming like you go

(mm)
but if I'm the person I'll just ask for higher pay [ah]
(mm)
but you know it's like it's so obvious [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> like the whole team come early <malay>tak apa juga</malay>
<malay>seorang datang</malay>
(mm) (hmm)
it's good [lah] on the resume
because she thinks she's new (mm)
like there are other people who she feels better than her [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya I think just rise up to the occasion
but I also think the the colleague <malay>yang nak</malay> leave <malay>tu</malay> like just try <malay>sebelum</malay> leave just try one shot like you think any possibility to increase my pay since I'm doing more you know that kind of thing then if really you cannot then just quit quit [lor]

I don't know
I don't know
I didn't give that mindset [what] like last time also holiday is like finish up the
(um)
assessment book that kind but the thing is right (um)
was #ilya# <malay>ni bila</malay>
she wanted to use my phone I think then I was like (um)
I see okay I ask her [lah] [oh] when you have one dollar then I start <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>dia dah</malay> then I say what is that
(uh)
[oh] like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like !hey! I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like !huh! maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
then <malay>baru dia</malay> like
okay okay and (uh)
that's usual [lah] cause #ilan# was around and then he like gives clues he is so annoying you know
I thought that was under you [what]
timetable [kan]
I never teach her timetable [lah] I always subtraction <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> count backwards
<malay>dengan tu</malay>
like like she can even ask me like when I said
like <malay>apa</malay> (um)
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
[eh] (err) one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me (err) is it (err) minus or plus
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money [ah] or you lose money or you take away and she go [oh] <malay>duit</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> no I find <malay>dia tak</malay> grasp the concept <malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>dia cuma</malay> like [oh] I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent [ah]
ya ya ya that kind of thing
like #ilan# is some one <malay>senang nak tangkap sebab dia</malay>
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff [lah]
but for her <malay>dia punya</malay> ya the concept
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her [ah]
then I because I at the same time <malay>aku pun</malay> spring clean #ilan's# room I threw quite a lot like all those also gonna throw (err) except for that cotton on (uh) paper bag [ah] <malay>tu barang-barang</malay>
<malay>atas</malay>

introduction ya ya definitely but you cannot first paragraph [jer] good <malay>lepas tu</malay> lousy right

punctuation marks I don't know why

#ilya# first
just now when did (err) why did (uh) your friend calling me
(mm)
confidential stuff
confidential stuff
(mm)

it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say [ah]
how's your day
it's been like I started I <malay>pergi pasar tadi pagi</malay> after that
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
okay so <malay>tadi</malay> [kan]
so <malay>tadi tadi</malay>
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday [kan] she I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
#cheng san# go and message me <malay>cakap</malay>
[oh] miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already [what] what's happening
yesterday right
then #cheng san# was like [oh] I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
it's quite it's quite annoying [ah] <malay>pasal macam</malay>
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three
and #ming gee# that's six people okay
and she's like [oh] some of them say they are open to it
(um) and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say [oh] they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group [lah] if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
I told her it's whatever [ah] <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> whatever you want to do [ah] <malay>kau punya pasal</malay> [ah] so
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it [oh] so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her [lah] and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else [ah] like
<malay>kau punya pasal</malay> [lah] you know
you got your own issues then
(ugh) okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do thing
sub for school
where your <malay>malam</malay>
my mother is here <malay>ketawa</malay>
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time [ah]
then now she go
[oh] <malay>suji</malay> [eh] I ask [ah] <malay>dah tanya</malay> [eh]
I'll tell my mum you don't sell the <malay>suji</malay> first until
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
but then it's like this big and I'm like are you sure you want to sell <malay>suji</malay> that small
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny [ah]
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[oh] she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
[eh]
do not off
(mm)
honestly an issue in [ah] <malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dah pukul satu pagi</malay>
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim #boon lay# [kan]
man it's just generally quiet [lah] also
I don't know [ah] cause that time [lor] <malay>malam</malay>
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was #syaza's# #syaza's# shoot
but #syaza's# shoot jingle was there
#serangoon# but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
!ow!
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion !wow!
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
<malay>tapi</malay> I haven't really like used it fully because circuit breaker
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
[ah] I don't know [lah] it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one (uh huh)
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say [ah]
<malay>bila kita</malay> jewel [ah]
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday [lah] in school so ya
[ah] ya
once every twice a month
<malay>apa kau cakap</malay>
<malay>keluar</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>itu enam kali</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu enam kali apa</malay>
<malay>dua bulan sekali</malay>
okay [lah]
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
<malay>lepas ni</malay> so <malay>sekarang tak boleh</malay> okay
[eh] but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
not all also [lah] cause <malay>dia orang cakap macam terbelit-belit</malay> also still
so <malay>tak faham pun</malay> but
<malay>apa</malay>
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
<malay>kasih dengar</malay> the autotune
and I'm like
(mm) I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
(err) my I think the only like studio that can fit that is neapolis <malay>atau</malay> infinite [eh] studios I don't know
but it was quite cool [lah]
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel #del luna#
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from right
(mm)
this malay boy and he graduated and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
and he went to korea without like any money or anything so <malay>macam</malay>
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
and he <malay>tak</malay> even go for like classes to <malay>belajar</malay> you know he just like
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool [lah]
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like !huh!
maybe I should do that !duh! I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like [ho]
ya
but
it was an option [ah]
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first [eh] one for one [eh]
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
if you <malay>ikut macam</malay> the business like module
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent [kan] to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
ya the food <malay>punya</malay>
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
<malay>itu</malay> [jer]
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
!huh!
are you sure are you sure
but only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
<malay>macam</malay> you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation [kan] a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
<malay>ambil</malay> and try
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like [oh] you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
<malay>tak bagi</malay> like anybody just <malay>masuk tahu</malay> so you have to like
queue to <malay>masuk</malay>
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty [ah]
I have nothing to say about that [ah]
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility [kan]
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not [kan]
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
<malay>sakit</malay> everything they keep saying they keep separating
migrant workers and community cases like as if
<malay>satu</malay> is one species another one is another species
like it's the same thing both is humans
if there's fifteen migrant worker <malay>yang kena</malay>
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
they are exposed to <malay>tak akan</malay> migrant workers [jer] [kan]
obviously with everybody [what] with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
everyday <malay>macam</malay> add one two people like in the community cases [kan]
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
!aiya! it's so
shady
but we know that [lah]
but
but just what like
(mm) but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to thinking like !wah! I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
<malay>macam</malay> some kind of investigative like journalist <malay>gitu</malay>
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad [lah] like
we we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
and then we all will <malay>mati</malay> together
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
(mm) just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere !aiya! it's just
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> as we grow older I guess
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
what the world is then we get <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
<malay>aku lagi penat daripada kau</malay> you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like [oh] I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
ya <malay>pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>penat</malay>
I don't know [lah]
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film <malay>penat</malay> [sia]
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
(mm)
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
there's this <malay>macam</malay>
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which <malay>mazhab</malay> you're looking at also
<malay>pasal</malay> if you're talking about
like <malay>kita punya mazhab memang</malay> we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
but we have no firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
there's other <malay>mazhab</malay> that's like
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
!yay! we love grey areas
!aiya! and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
like this idea of <malay>mazhab</malay> is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
you know
that's like my question because the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing came about because of
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
<malay>macam</malay> concerns [lah]
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
then is the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing going to change or what
because this is
islamic law [kan] but it's not like
a set in stone thing cause the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing was never like set in stone
until the scholars were like (hmm)
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like (hmm) we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
people there might adopt our <malay>mazhab punya</malay> practices
she will be adopting other <malay>mazhab</malay> practices and when she comes back here
then it's like (hmm) you know
culture changes also so it's like (ugh)
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change [ah] but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
just about <malay>sembah</malay> this one <malay>tuhan</malay>
and believing in our prophets our <malay>rukun iman</malay> and <malay>rukun islam</malay>
and not
whether
touching a dog is <malay>haram</malay> so ya that's like my
thoughts of this so deep
<malay>macam</malay> over
moved a circle
really [ah] shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
[eh] I spend a lot of my day talking (err) like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes (err) sometimes I never notice then [oh] marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
to be fair <malay>kasihan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia macam</malay>
sec one <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> COVID <malay>terus tak ada</malay> friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
[oh] all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you [what] all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them [lah] and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
(mm)
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
!wah! I don't know man
are you saying me and #jufri# have the same face
attractiveness level
!eww!
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like (err) so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app [kan] I I
at first I put my name
[kan] like my whole name I'm #nabilah#
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private [lah] and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like !whoa! people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
!ee! that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
(ugh)
(oo) I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already [lah] to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
this is like there is a goal <malay>punya cerita</malay> after that
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years <malay>tahu</malay>
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable [lah] because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
<malay>habis</malay>
the whole family was like [oh] <malay>dia dia minum arak dia pergi</malay>
<malay>apa dia makan</malay> drugs <malay>semua</malay> that kind of thing you know and then when we met him I was like he was crying
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
[ah] you <malay>tak tak ada</malay> choice <malay>lain ke apa</malay> like
!ee! and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly [lah] actually he's worse than #jufri#
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
you know I <malay>macam</malay>
like
are you okay
you know and then
(uh) but his
he's weird [lah]
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny [lah] ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child [lah]
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
that lady was <malay>cantik</malay> [lah] and she was with us for three years
but it was like damn disgusting
like <malay>kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa</malay> that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like !eww! like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
!eww! no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the [ah] the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
I'm like <malay>kau dah tua</malay> stop it [lah]
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
[oh] my god
like
I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
<malay>tak tahu</malay> asian <malay>pun boleh suka</malay> asian asian girls
it is funny [ah]
(mm)
I think he
he's crazy [ah]
[oh] my god that's that's like the the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
that kind of guys will be like [oh] <malay>nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan</malay> I [lah]
<malay>masakkan</malay> I like some <malay>sambal goreng</malay> or something like that then I'm like !huh!
you think I <malay>kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>kau kelakar ke apa</malay> you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
(mm)
it should swing that way
but I like male male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like [oh]
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
[oh] my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I [ah] ya
it's like I get it [lah] okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like [oh] I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like [oh]
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
(mm)
<malay>banyak menganggur</malay>
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know (ugh)
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
the I'll be like [oh] [ah] [lah] I degree <malay>tapi</malay> film [jer] film [jer] you know that kind of thing
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
(mm) (uh) you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
!aiya! and you feel shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
<malay>kau</malay> thanks man
that is just not my style
!aiya! my worst match just for ego boost [lah] lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life (mm)
it's quite funny [ah]
there was a guy who asked what what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell [lah] then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
(err)
I don't know I think I will still talk to you [oh] you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
[ah] that's quite funny
I mean
(mm)
actually I'm the same [lah]
but I short lady [ah] so good for me
(mm)
I'd feel iffy about it [lah] but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm [eh] I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like !huh!
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket [lah] bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so !aduh! it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
!aiya!
I lazy [ah]
ya
higher angle [eh]
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
[oh]
that's my only photo that I use for until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad (ugh)
ya
I have so many selfies
and then you can tell like the first like five selfies is like me like really want to <malay>perasan</malay>
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid [lah]
okay [lah] at least I rent a smart eight one [lah]
but he's damn tall [sial]
he's damn tall to me [lah]
you talk about him I'm like [oh]
[ah]
ya
<malay>kau [sial]
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then I'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay [lah] he sees you like that [what] and he still like you so
that's all right right (hmm)
you you you know it's it's legit
I don't know I never checked she's like sorry it's a bad timing I know I think it's about me
I'm like !aiya!
<malay>pukul satu pagi saat dia</malay> text <malay>dah nak pukul dua</malay>

hello <malay>mas apa khabar</malay>
I'm fine thank you
how's your family
[ah]
ya second one is a boy right
[oh] I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
it's okay <malay>macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana</malay> (mm) so what are your plans for this weekend
[oh]
(uh) I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it (um) you might know them because some of them are our former [ah] schoolmates
[oh] yes #ahmad# is there (uh) <malay>dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada</malay> (uh) think four or five kids
no [lah] it's okay [ah] <malay>rezeki masing-masing</malay> [ah] so are you not going out with your family today
[oh] you're into baking now !wah! that's nice !wah! must try some of your cake soon [ah]
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
[ah] movie but [ah] during this pandemic kind of hard [lah] because I think with the crowd control and all
!wah! netflix and chill [ah]
(err) I don't know (uh) only so far only a few have confirmed but (uh)
I will update you [ah] on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can [lah] (uh)
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
[ah]
(um) but is it too young for them to start
(um) going to tuition at this age she's only six years old [kan]
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that (err) everyone is competing (uh) so
it's
it has its pros and cons [ah] like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
ya but
slowly [lah] but surely (uh) I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important [lah] they just try their best [lah]
and
I I do have other maybe (uh) I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
[oh] [oh]
[orh] okay okay I understand I can ask for you [lah] then
(err) we'll see what we can arrange
(err)
!wah! you sit down at coffeeshop [ah] I thought you #atas# [one]
[oh] you you full time housewife [ah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tu boleh jaga anak-anak</malay>
good [lah]
actually it's better for to me [lah] personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
(um) like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore (err) I think (err)
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive [ah] then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day (uh) some owners also like abuse their maid [lah] so that's not right [lah] I feel
ya there's (uh) the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse [ah] think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news [lah] but you just have to be updated [lah] now with the
COVID nineteen [ah] I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that [lah] before they are cleared to do cleaning [oh] (mm)
<malay>bagus</malay> [seh] <malay>masak untuk</malay> husband all
[oh] must take care of your health now [lah]
like but I think if now if you go to any
(uh) I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya [lah] for those who are working [lah] they will give you like
to check on yourself
(err) so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ya but <malay>ni adalah satu</malay> (uh) precaution for us to take ya so <malay>kita perlu berhati-hati</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so <malay>penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah</malay> [jer]
(uh) #alhamdulilah# so far
I'm okay [lah] maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest (uh) because of work [ah]
ya [lah] stress [lah] at work <malay>macam-macam</malay>
(um) politic [lah] then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what (uh)
safety measure measurement at work (mm) cause yes
now currently we have this installation (uh) of #doraemon# at the national museum it's interesting [lah] but
since it's the holidays [kan] <malay>banyak orang-orang datang</malay> (uh) visit museum
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak datang dengan</malay> family <malay>nak kena datang</malay> on weekdays
(uh) weekend <malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal terlalu ramai</malay>
(uh) until <malay>nak</malay> queue under the hot sun <malay>pengsan pula</malay>
(um) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>semua kena</malay> queue <malay>macam biasa</malay>

special queue

[ah]
[oh] ya ya I've read about it but <malay>belum ada</malay> time [lah] to redeem tour voucher
(uh)
[oh] I don't think <malay>ada</malay>
for kids <malay>ada tu</malay> vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
(uh) claim it
online [ah] so it's not that bad [lah] hundred dollars <malay>pun jadi</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>biasa</malay> [lah] singaporean <malay>bila yang dia orang tak</malay> complain
[oh] usually you go to #johor# [ah] and do your shopping
(mm) understand ya I think (uh) COVID nineteen <malay>ni menjejas banyak</malay> singaporean
then ya [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday <malay>pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu</malay> [lah]
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so <malay>pasal</malay> I think malaysia <malay>pun sekarang masih ada banyak</malay> case [ah] so it's still unstable [lah]
I think so far our government has done well [lah] to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
(mm)
[oh]
I think (uh) ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also <malay>ada bilang juga</malay>
[ah] so it's like
(uh) they have different sizes [lah] and
(uh) they cater also for kids
(mm)

ya
ya but surprisingly
(uh) so far <malay>tak ada pula</malay> case <malay>yang lain-lain</malay>
I mean <malay>yang</malay> in the community [lah]
I think they are currently
preparing [ah] for phase three to roll out but ya [lah] depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert [lah] it's important [lah] for us to be on alert
[ah] because you will never know [seh] who <malay>yang ada penyakit ni</malay> then <malay>kita pun senang jangkit</malay> especially <malay>dengan macam</malay>
<malay>warga emas dengan kita punya</malay> parents <malay>nak kena jaga-jaga</malay>
ya I think <malay>baru semalam</malay> news (uh) that people are queuing over at <malay>mana</malay> [eh]
[ah] foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
in place [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] from the look of the photos <malay>tak ada</malay> [jer] think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
(mm)
ya [lah] that's where the christmas light up is <malay>lagi</malay> so this year has been a challenging year [lah] [ah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>ada bagus juga</malay> [lah] that you
<malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to <malay>ke</malay> malaysia <malay>ke</malay> I think it's affecting business everywhere (uh) <malay>kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian</malay> [kan]
I think (mm) <malay>mana-mana</malay> affected
you know
(mm) ya [lah] but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> are required to have the mandatory swab test then (uh) like
stay home notice ya
and I think (uh) for those who are coming in I think
(uh) they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure [ah] I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required [lah] [eh] even when they come in they have to do the swab test [lah]
[ah]
ya thankfully
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] so I I <malay>dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena</malay> swab test <malay>yang</malay>
(uh) <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau dibuat dengan betul tak</malay> [lah] <malay>rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru</malay> or trainee <malay>yang buat</malay> !wah! <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali</malay>
a
(mm) yes yes
(uh) I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the (uh) the conduct the test
ya I think I even my friend <malay>yang</malay>
was (mm) asked to leave I think he got a job as a security [lah] (err) and considered is also a high risk because (err) he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm (uh)
but actually they're paying quite
high [lah] is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that [lah] because they don't want to
be in contact [ah] ya don't want to be exposed to this (uh) and even when he he's finished his job think he ask (uh) his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can (uh) remove his clothes outside his house (uh) ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace [lah] so it's just an
additional steps [ah] precaution ya
[ah]
ya you see
ya actually quite <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] in this situation <malay>macam banyak orang ada</malay> family but
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> business <malay>tutup</malay>
[ah] so it's not easy [ah] it's quite
twenty twenty has been (uh) ya [lah] like I said a challenge [lah] <malay>untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan</malay> [lah]
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
measure steps [ah] I think which is quite good [lah] for all [lah] even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted <malay>tak boleh keluar ke apa</malay> but still it's for our own good [lah]
[oh] I do actually (err) I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like [ah] so he and his wife <malay>dah beli</malay>
a few cartons [eh] I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe [lah]
got some quality is not that good [ah]
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask [ah]
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but I don't know how <malay>berapa bagus yang</malay> reusable <malay>punya</malay> mask
ya but
no [lah] I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last [lah] (err) for a few months then but you have to
wash [lah] I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] because (uh)
<malay>bulan</malay> december (err) think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe <malay>nak ajak makan</malay> [lah] but
(err) according to the
safety measurement I think
!wah! only can <malay>keluar</malay> (um) five <malay>lima orang sahaja</malay>
(mm)
ya can okay [lah] that's an idea but
think <malay>kalau</malay> the atmosphere is different [lah] when you dining outside (err) <malay>dengan makan kat rumah</malay> [kan]
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
take care of ourselves [lah] think the celebration is is actually <malay>pasal kita nak kena</malay>
<malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
<malay>janji kita sihat</malay>
(mm) <malay>mana kita berhenti tadi</malay>
(um) [ah] <malay>awak</malay>
<malay>seorang</malay> baker <malay>awak suka masak apa</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> family
(mm)
<malay>pandai juga awak</malay> baking [eh] <malay>abeh kalau masak masak apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>untuk</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>suami awak</malay> family <malay>awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay>
(mm) <malay>mungkin pasal orang dah</malay> stock up <malay>ke</malay> (uh) <malay>iya</malay> [lah] singaporean [kan] <malay>macam saya cakap</malay> #kiasu# <malay>dia orang suka benar simpan</malay>
[oh] <malay>beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi</malay> (uh) three or four packets for a family of
[ah] three [kan] (mm)
ya [lah] <malay>kesian yang orang-orang yang ya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada pendapatan</malay> (mm) <malay>tapi saya rasa</malay> <malay>ada juga</malay> restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
(mm) ya [lah] <malay>saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang pergi</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay> (uh) there's a lot of platform <malay>yang</malay> go digital so I think (uh) everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop [ah] these are now necessities
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya I think (uh) a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can [lah] so it's best they do so [lah] during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected [seh] ya I think my friends either <malay>yang kena</malay> retrenched at an early age [eh]
feels also quite sad [lah] for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something [ah] but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad [lah] but it's better than not having no job and all [lah] ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya [lah]
ya [lah] it's tiring [lah] even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now (uh) doing grab but grab is also affected (err) think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he (uh) took back the car ya but still it's not doing well [lah] he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental (uh)
ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
I think <malay>dia tak akan</malay> take the swabber paying job [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I think he has more kids at home <malay>kesian takut</malay> he'll be affected [lah] even though he'll be (uh) think
he has his reasons [lah] for not doing that kind even though it's (uh) <malay>gaji tinggi</malay> but still <malay>dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan</malay> (uh)
to the family [lah]
(mm) true [lah] I think
the government implementing a lot of (err) help for those
need them [ah] they also I think they have set up this (um) united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need [lah] ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march [ah] I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya [lah] things will get better [lah] think I think for singaporean [ah] they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases [ah] that can affect us
ya where should we go to <malay>makan</malay> what is your favourite food
#prata#
(uh) there's a #prata# at #sin ming# I think it's quite nice it's run by a family (uh) father and a son
can can (um)
can [ah] maybe I want to try eat the #briyani# [ah]
the #briyani# is quite nice [ah] I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best [ah]
(err) what do you want to order I help you order
the #briyani# or the #prata# coin is also nice
yes the curry is (uh) <malay>sedap</malay>
and it's
<malay>tak pedas sangat</malay>
I think just the right
taste [ah]
can
(uh) I think I eat #briyani# with (uh) fried chicken [lah] (mm) because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking [ah]
then what drinks do you want
#teh# #peng# #teh# #peng#
#teh# with ice [eh]
ya but I think is not that good to always drink #teh# with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better [lah] at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health (err) and also see what eat we eat
[ah] and also see what we eat
okay
can
(uh)
anything else
!wah! there's a lot of people in the queue

[oh] so we have to pick up or
[oh] okay [oh] that's
!wah! see <malay>sekarang semua dah</malay> high tech
order <malay>makan pun boleh</malay>
ya I understand but (err) I volunteered with (err) an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food (err) to buy groceries so that they will minimize (err) their movement outside [ah] so they can actually (err) contact us and have like medication
(uh) you can buy for them and then send it to their homes (um)
ya [lah] I think it's a long way to help our seniors (uh)
because I think if they are exposed to this I think (um) probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is (uh) I think done by government agencies [ah] they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors (uh) so that they will not be exposed much [ah] so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies [ah] then we will be there to send groceries medication (uh) food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer [lah] through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask [eh] for more information [lah] ya
ya at this point <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's not
(um)
not right to be walking on their own <malay>tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> I think it will take <malay>masa yang panjang untuk dia orang</malay> to recover to get well [ah] <malay>kesian</malay> I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
free [ah]
(mm) <malay>betul tu abeh lagi</malay> cause my parents are staying on their own <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] we don't get to meet them as much <malay>abeh ada</malay> some old folks <malay>tak tahu pakai</malay> smartphone so <malay>lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu</malay> so <malay>kesian dia orang</malay> so <malay>masa-masa gini</malay> [lah] <malay>kita patut berwaspada</malay> even though it's sad but we have to follow [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] <malay>yang generasi yang</malay>
<malay>lama mereka tak</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> internet <malay>macam kita sekarang</malay> so with this technology I think <malay>dia orang</malay> will
[ah] <malay>ambil masa untuk</malay>
<malay>mempelajari semua abeh kalau kita</malay>
<malay>tak ada di sana</malay>
<malay>makin susah</malay>
so <malay>kesian</malay> so
communication
is
<malay>macam makin kurang</malay> and there's less interaction human interaction
ya [lah] <malay>tapi segolongan mungkin tak ramai orang tua yang mahu belajar pasal pada mereka mereka dah lanjut usia</malay> and <malay>dah tak banyak masa lagi dalam dunia cuma kita doakan yang terbaik kita pun kalau boleh</malay>
<malay>nak dia orang bersama kita</malay>
(mm) actually in the market now there's quite a number of phones [lah] <malay>yang mereka boleh gunakan cuma iya</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena ajar mereka tu mungkin mengambil masa</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
data
(mm)
that's why it's (uh) important [lah] to <malay>untuk mereka</malay> (um) update <malay>dengan</malay> keep with the trend <malay>apa yang berlaku bukan jadi</malay> trendy [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> keep up with the times
<malay>mungkin juga</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang mungkin dalam masa yang terdekat akan masuk ketiga</malay> so <malay>mudah-mudahan kita semua dapat</malay>
(um) <malay>balik semula kehidupan yang</malay> normal
[oh] the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort [ah] to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal [ah]
some <malay>dan hari raya</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm) (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> contact is now minimal [lah] (mm)
<malay>sedih</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam mana</malay>
<malay>kita harus mengikut peraturan</malay>
<malay>mungkin kelonggaran ini akan dinaikkan</malay> [lah] <malay>setiap fasa mungkin melebih lebih orang boleh keluar boleh jumpa boleh bergaul tapi ambil masa ya</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> singaporean usually <malay>kalau</malay> holiday <malay>akan</malay> go overseas (uh) (mm) holiday (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang tengah</malay>
<malay>keadaan begini semuanya</malay>
<malay>tak boleh kemana-mana cuma di</malay> singapore

<malay>harap bersabar sahaja</malay> [lah] <malay>kita doa-doa yang terbaik semoga keadaan akan bertambah baik untuk kita semua</malay>

safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide [lah]

okay
[oh] my god stop
okay so (um) actually he was one of the first few (um) like accounts that I watch on tiktok [lah] and I started it obviously time [ah] times you lane
time <malay>semua orang tak ada kerja lain</malay>
ya so he was on my list like [eh] local (uh) local account [lah] like [eh] this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the <malay>dia punya</malay> videos was all quite <malay>macam</malay> angsty [ah] like
[oh] you see this vulgar #tat# #tut# #tat# semua basically like <malay>macam</malay> all the people like being annoying [lah] time <malay>dia tengah nak</malay> deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of <malay>dia pergi</malay> #tampines# mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and <malay>pasal tu</malay> time [kan] so we cannot go out [kan] and I was like [oh] my god I've never seen #tampines# mall look like that
ya serious <malay>macam</malay> like like some horror story is here
I can't remember april april may ya april may ya
I'm like when did I stop my attachment
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like <malay>malam-malam buta</malay> like nine plus I was like [eh] this guy doing live live what [sia]
because at that point in time I just thought <malay>macam</malay> he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like [oh] !wow! !wow! he cause it
yes <malay>abang</malay> grabfood
and I think the funniest part was that (um) based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind <malay>yang</malay> like cause of like his friends <malay>dulu kat</malay> secondary school <malay>semua</malay> [kan] and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like <malay>apa ni</malay> bro
ya so (uh) people will like are you malay are you malay then he's like what only malay is it do grabfood
I was like boo
ya I know right ya then ya but (uh) turns out he's chinese [lah] so and then I thought he was #ah beng# actually
he actually he has the #beng# vibes but the most <malay>kekek</malay> thing is like the way he talks is very <malay>macam</malay> narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
then it was like !whoa! you all think that my voice very mesmerizing
<malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] like

!eww! then <malay>aku</malay> press <malay>dia punya</malay> profile then I was like [oh] my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya [oh] it was so scary so and then (um) so he me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk [kan] is <malay>macam</malay> corporate <malay>gila</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dekat dia tanya</malay> (um) in which area do you reside I was like reside [eh]
first off <malay>aku dah</malay> block <malay>dia</malay> I was like saying (uh) don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because of a small lampoon like there was this cause they remember me under sixteen year old girl then I'm just like okay you could in some ways typical is like the wild wild wet
ya because (uh) and then <malay>semalam pun</malay> like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like [ah] [eh] awkward
technically [ah] I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation <malay>yang pakai</malay> [kan] but it's still very disturbing [lah] but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like <malay>tak layan</malay> and then he doesn't assume anything [oh] ya then he was like how do I address you [ah] <malay>aku</malay> was like how do I address you <malay>macam</malay> then
the next for me <malay>macam</malay> the automatic response is miss #farizan# <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>macam merepek</malay> [sia]

<malay>macam</malay> there's the reputation [kan]
(mm)
technically those people must be underage <malay>juga</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I don't know how though but
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just <malay>macam</malay> by proximity like you know the few local
(mm)
you're talking about <malay>macam</malay> algorithm <malay>dia</malay>
sometimes you will realise you videos what have I got fifty and just kept yes doesn't vote so once once you realise just that it's video isn't as popular as between other users then it just doesn't show any
[oh]
!wow!
ya
yes
!huh!
[oh]
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post <malay>terus</malay> like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I <malay>macam</malay> okay all right
like then the subsequent <malay>macam</malay> views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>benda-benda bodoh</malay> I don't tag it I just <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know I don't put anything in the caption you know if you find me it is from the song
ever since (um) but ever since (uh) grab ge</mandarin> I privated my tiktok
wait you drunk courtesy and he's already falling
I don't I don't I don't want I don't want weirdos following me
[eh] he's already following me
so now we're friends on tiktok
I do
apparently I'm one of two people who know and I'm just like ya okay
ya so that's the thing right I was like !wow! I didn't know that tiktok <malay>ada</malay> live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched

ya so it's (um) it's really interesting it's like you know how (um) live [eh] no not live [eh] live and live <malay>ada</malay> like the likes [kan] but it's just <malay>macam</malay> free [kan] you press
<malay>jadi boleh</malay> spam <malay>ke apa entah</malay> so <malay>apa ni</malay> like tiktok <malay>ada</malay> like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
so they get I guess the creator gets like part of it but tiktok gets like a slice of how much you send
ya
ya so just like [oh] thanks you know it's like ya
ya ya ya
I don't think it's that much [lah] because like I said <malay>macam dia punya</malay> follower base is more like <malay>budak-budak kecil</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> he will he will say say like [oh] thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like [oh] thanks for the rainbow puke and I <malay>pun macam</malay> he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk <malay>sekarang pun</malay> like <malay>dah lagi mahal</malay> bro
but it tells you [lah] something so I was like okay
so like everyone is always saying stuff like [oh] come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel [lah] [kan] and <malay>aku</malay> was like what is this thing he's talking about
so I went to scroll a few pages of emojis right
!wah! that's like that's fair

is like I signed up [kan] time (uh) it was like there's no physical lindy class
and then like I think I finished my virtual <malay>punya</malay> class and <malay>macam</malay> they just started opening that time face to #babad# like
cause I cause I saw the thing is I saw #insyirah# (uh) dance is it first like pre
then I was like my god because (uh) I was I was into the music
like middle of last year or something so I always like holy shit like how I know I I I (uh) I recognize the dance moves [kan] then I was like !hey! #insyirah# like is this afrobeat standard like ya <malay>macam</malay> how you know and all that then <malay>aku aku</malay> was telling her [lah] that I listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying [oh] it's that this studio #da# #da# #da# #da# so (uh) it took me like damn long like <malay>aku</malay> just took the information and just like <malay>buat bodoh</malay> [ah] until happened
and then phase two then <malay>aku</malay> was like okay if I were to do a dance class that is not a lindy I'm gonna do this
ya so that's how I started [lah] so the first my first the first class I went was with her and then it was very #suay# because it was like
a super fast one and <malay>aku</malay> was like <malay>aku nak mati</malay> [eh]
ya because unsubsequently it was like slow and chill and guess what today also was fast for me I was just like !wow! do you just not like me
after a long break it's just like <malay>rombak rombak</malay> and I was like [ha]
(um) okay so it depends on the studio but like that studio because of the size they can accommodate (um) three groups of five
like and then like each five <malay>ada</malay> like segment [ah] then you cannot mix
okay like and then like each each five I do like segment are and you cannot mix ya by right [lah] then that one [ah] because you maintain two meters with grammars
ya by right [lah]
then that one (uh) because you maintain two meters <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask
[kan]
ya my lindy <malay>punya yang</malay> solo <malay>pun begitu</malay> (uh) our capacity is about twelve
so <malay>sama</malay> [lah] two meters and all that <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask <malay>tapi tu</malay> recently (um) because of (uh) partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then <malay>tu kena pakai</malay> mask [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> like contact
but <malay>itu pun</malay> they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] partner <malay>ada</malay> ya
<malay>dah lama</malay> I <malay>tak joget penat gila</malay> [sia] I was like (ugh)

it's like !wah! I love him <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>dia punya</malay> beat <malay>dia punya</malay> percussion <malay>dia</malay> is like is like
it's not as tacky as like <malay>macam ada</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> [ah] <malay>rentak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> like #kebak# #kebak# means like cool
and <malay>macam</malay> I feel like <malay>dia orang punya bahasa</malay> is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like (um) the class introduced me to all new like new songs [lah] as in new and <malay>macam</malay> different artists [ah] artists that I don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
I don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists <malay>ke apa</malay> besides beyonce
ya his name is #zul#
ya [oh] my gosh okay so that's the other thing like I feel so <malay>macam</malay> at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
okay
[ah] confirm zumba
like that's the only thing <malay>kita boleh buat</malay> like hello excuse me hello police
[oh] my god
ya so and <malay>macam</malay> the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind <malay>yang</malay> like having fun is more important
<malay>macam</malay> you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but <malay>macam</malay> he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
<malay>macam buang tabiat gitu ada orang cakap</malay>
ya but he very cool [lah] <malay>macam</malay> even the not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no [ah]
no no no actually K K <malay>jap</malay> there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then #zul# is one of the teachers
he teaches afro
then #hakim# also teaches like (um) dance fall but I don't like dance fall dance fall <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>macam</malay> sexy [ah] I <malay>macam</malay> !oof!
I'm not I'm not ready for that
ya I'm not shy
ya then okay it's quite <malay>kekek</malay> like last two days [kan] I went for the same studio I tried (uh) homerun choreo
that one like <malay>aku nak mati</malay> [sia]
the person [kan] like mellow she's a good dancer but <malay>dia punya ajar dia macam</malay> like from the get go is like super detailed
<malay>macam</malay> my brain cannot
<malay>macam badan</malay> angle <malay>tangan</malay> angle
[ah] <malay>kepala</malay> angle I <malay>macam</malay> (ugh)
<malay>goyang</malay>
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I <malay>macam</malay>
ya
ya so I was just like (um)
yes and <malay>loncat-loncat</malay>
so I mean at zero point six it was okay zero point seven still can point eight (mm) I'm starting to fall apart
nine I'm not very sure what's going on I'm definitely at least two counts behind
but it was but the the first then she did the chorus in two days
so the first day (um) afro was like in the corner
then <malay>macam</malay> I felt so demoralized [ah] like it's so <malay>susah</malay> and like
so for me the thing is that like <malay>kalau</malay> stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
I think cause I'm not like a fan [kan] I just do it cause <malay>macam</malay> it looked interesting
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something
and then the ones next to her friends <malay>semua</malay> they were like [eh] today I become chicken [ah] I was like that's not wrong <malay>macam</malay> a lot of them their position I'm just like <malay>kenapa ayam kenapa ayam</malay>
!huh!
ya <malay>macam</malay> cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
homerun
[oh] no sorry sorry the studio beat factory fitness
sorry [ah] <malay>pekak</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>apa-apa pun pekak</malay>
[eh] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah] K <malay>jap</malay>
[dah] [lah]
okay okay I have I can explain I can explain this is my old one
(um) actually no (uh) this is the one for my games
ya
no [lah] okay so <malay>ceritanya</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> [tau] this phone the near RAM only three gig
<malay>dia punya</malay> internal <malay>kalau bukan</malay> sixteen thirty two [eh]
basically it's more [lah] then after that I download a lot of okay I did not download a lot of games I just download maplestory
and then [eh] I try to log in from outram <malay>sampai</malay> past series <malay>belum</malay> log in you
disconnect lag crash <malay>semua</malay> the whole cycle
ya ya ya [a'ah] soon
!whoa! <malay>macam</malay> no ya so then I could I could I really cannot you like besides gaming <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] like it's just super laggy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and <malay>macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal</malay> (err) internal memory <malay>dia dah habis</malay> [kan]
so like literally I was running on <malay>entah</malay> something <malay>macam</malay> hundred of free space <malay>ke apa entah</malay>
exactly so that's why <malay>macam dia punya</malay> performance <malay>pun dah macam tahi</malay> [ah]
!huh! but anyway <malay>dah dua dah dua tahun</malay> [ah]
so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for <malay>macam</malay> work <malay>taruh</malay> like (um) prepaid <malay>ke apa kat dalam tu</malay>
ya so then I don't need to like bother using my
!huh! then like bye ya
because actually phone <malay>ni tak rosak</malay> ya it's just and after I bought it over I I can uninstall all the things I'm not using ya so
I uninstall [lah] everything and now it's okay [ah]
(mm) it's okay then now I found a new use for it [lah] because I was thinking [eh] <malay>macam mana kalau</malay> I want to game but I also want to watch his live
I <malay>akan dengar</malay> I just <malay>dengar suara dia</malay> [jer]
ya <malay>dah suara dia sedap</malay>

<malay>suara dia macam macam dia punya</malay> voice quality is very good
like <malay>macam</malay> okay K K (uh) I once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory M <malay>punya</malay> guide
he was like okay hi everybody (um) [ah] [ah] this a guide to ivan okay so the most important is you take the debris okay the debris is very useful [lor] can boost your damage
<malay>macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak</malay> [ah] (hmm)

slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
<malay>rasa macam</malay> escapism which I'm like [oh] <malay>macam</malay> I don't like to be too close to reality
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite #gundam# series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
(mm)
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy [lah] like
like you know brings us together
it was the most <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that #bandai# has released recently that's not the most <malay>merepek</malay>
but it's the most <malay>macam</malay> fantasy [lah] like super idealistic you know <malay>macam</malay> the guy must must always get the girl and then <malay>ada</malay> rival <malay>ada</malay> love triangle
that's rude ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis orang mati</malay> one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
that's rude
ya <malay>macam</malay> [oh] and then (um) they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere <malay>macam</malay>
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
because at that time [kan] that (uh) <malay>macam</malay> the way you pilot is still <malay>macam pakai macam</malay> like you driving <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] you <malay>akan pakai</malay> (um) got the <malay>apa macam</malay> clutch <malay>semua</malay> and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart <malay>macam</malay> the later on the #animes# [kan] they they used <malay>macam</malay> (uh) like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much [lah] you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it (uh) I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves <malay>ke apa entah</malay> like okay sure like that's fine
like <malay>macam</malay> if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like [oh] <malay>macam</malay> drop drop from the sky <malay>gitu</malay> like <malay>merepek</malay>
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
(hmm)
ya because it's (mm) it's a bit <malay>dia punya</malay> plot
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
there's then #gundam# got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the #gundam# <malay>sampai</malay> like
and then they continue <malay>macam</malay> star wars <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so it's like !wah! the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya
ya but that one was okay but it was <malay>macam</malay> [eh] a bit too that one a bit too fantasy [ah]
although it did start [lah] it did spur it it started my my thing for #gundam# so okay fine fine I give you that #bandai#
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay [lah] fun
(hmm)
ya
yes so how did it go
(hmm)
she's like tall she's so tall
(hmm)
right right
ya <malay>betul</malay>
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
!oops!
!huh!
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore [oh] okay she knows [eh]
!wow!
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
(mm)
(mm)
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
(mm)
ya ya ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments [lah]
ya
ya it's always <malay>senang kalau nak cakap</malay>
because you're not in that situation <malay>apa</malay>
ya I see that a lot on twitter also <malay>macam</malay> they will like (err) retweet those those (um) am I am I am I an asshole <malay>punya</malay> post
and then <malay>dia orang</malay> just like throw the whole man away [lah] <malay>apa</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like ya like <malay>macam</malay>
I guess you can write that way but <malay>macam</malay> think about how that person is like going through right
correct ya ya
ya
sassy [ah]
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked (uh) #najhah# about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many [eh]
ya <malay>macam kau</malay> they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something <malay>aku rasa</malay>
maybe at most twenty plus [lah] but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as #naruto# and all that with like five hundred and two seasons [eh] three seasons [eh] in all that kind of
then <malay>macam</malay> !huh! okay <malay>itu</malay> [jer] like ya that's what I was thinking [oh] actually <malay>kalau</malay> I wanted to catch up session quite easy
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is twelve
and like the singapore people don't even the singapore <malay>punya</malay> what or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
ya but that's the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
I guess ya [lor] like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
but <malay>macam</malay> it's very like we we call it like what #anime# typical [lah] canon typical violence
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>entah</malay> [leh]
but our censorship <malay>selalu macam tu</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
ya
jesse
<malay>kau rembat</malay> [jer]
me and my western pop culture
<malay>kekek</malay> [jer] [sia]
ya
ya like [ho] <malay>kita</malay> cool
cools
[kan] <malay>kita dah besar</malay>
in this show in full !wow! really
I mean I don't
I have so many replies but I'll just I'll just keep it to myself
serious [ah] a full frontal is an eighteen [jer]
okay okay
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean it's different when you own it
#yikes#
how did #shah# react
so I was like [oh]
I mean it's different when you own it
[oh] my goodness
#yikes#
[oh] my goodness somehow I'm very surprised okay
you're prepared
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like and stuff right they will put like <malay>macam</malay> sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers <malay>kat bawah macam</malay>
ya nudity
ya
ya
it's like ya
and then it's like !whoa! full frontal !wow!
what
okay [lah] at least you were like considered legal
[oh] ya that's true
it sound so weird but <malay>macam</malay>
like in the science textbook they always show you <malay>macam</malay>
so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly [lah] it supposed to be a little like #teng# #teng# #teng# I mean
[oh] yikes
it scarred you
!alah! <malay>benda tu macam benda biasa</malay> [jer] <malay>bagi dia</malay>
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about <malay>macam</malay> like
and is it okay but I think it's really like <malay>macam</malay> commendable [lah] that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but <malay>macam</malay>
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
(um)
<malay>kenapa</malay>
[oh]
wait <malay>kejap dia</malay> interested <malay>ke dia macam</malay> intrigued
okay okay
[ah]
ya ya ya
it's true though
I wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like
the strange perceptions that I had of like relationships (hmm)
it's just like <malay>macam</malay> thinking about it
(mm)
ya
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time <malay>tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar</malay>
!oof!
<malay>masa tu</malay> like my god is sixteen
we haven't even graduated
right
[oh] my god ya
so it's like so <malay>meluat</malay>
that's that's the thing [sia]
when I <malay>jumpa</malay> that my malaysian friend I was like !duh!
as in I didn't say it <malay>macam</malay> explicitly but I was like <malay>dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa</malay>

public you have to wait
ya so <malay>kalau</malay> private they
<malay>dah bagi</malay> timing [lah] <malay>nak datang hari apa</malay> and at what time
and last thing I think I will buy like

<malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>takkan setakat nak beli satu sahaja tempat</malay>
(um) ya

I mean <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's a show but it's too overplayed
<malay>macam terlalu</malay> drama [lah]
ya
(mm) but
(mm)
I know dan
I know it's he he
I know dan is <malay>jadi</malay> gossip girl <malay>tetapi macam tak</malay> make sense [eh] story <malay>kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku</malay>
story <malay>kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku</malay>
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
ya
(mm) yes
(mm) <malay>sebab boleh nampak</malay> (mm)
ya
<malay>tetapi kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja</malay>
<malay>dia tak masuk akal</malay>
because dan
<malay>dia macam</malay> he in one scene <malay>dia pun terjekut</malay> he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so <malay>dia</malay> texting <malay>diri dia sendiri</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl <malay>boleh masuk akal</malay>
can make sense
ya or <malay>macam</malay>
but it also makes even more sense if everything that was sent through gossip girl just went up like that without filter
(mm) so the shock vaue makes sense [lah]
ya the fact
no the end result make him look like a psychopath
ya and the fact that <malay>dia dapat</malay> marry serena <malay>pun macam</malay> (err)
(mm)
I mean the
he gaslight
serena and then he talk trash about her <malay>dekat</malay> gossip girl
(mm) raccoon [lah] <malay>bapa dia pun sama</malay> [jer]
no the daughter also
no
vanessa
(mm)
but I like
#ya allah#
<malay>macam mana tak terkoyak seluar</malay>
(mm)
yes
<malay>tetapi</malay> wait <malay>dia punya</malay> part
part <malay>rambut itu</malay>
no [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> hairstyle <malay>dia kadang-kadang macam tak</malay> match
<malay>pelik</malay>
(mm) yes
[eh] <malay>dia dalam cerita</malay> star trek
[oh] <malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
what about her
(uh) <malay>siapa baru</malay> give birth <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
[oh] <malay>bukan bukan dah lama dah</malay>
ya
(uh) (uh)
but she is very pretty
(mm) [oh]
(mm) ya
like georgina though
(mm)
<malay>sebab dah tengok semua cerita lain</malay>
family [eh]
[oh] ya
a bit quite boring
for me
(mm)
ya
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I mean I'm saving up all the <malay>cerita</malay> for after exams
ya
next week
(mm) <malay>tengah belajar</malay>
school is okay a bit stressful but normal [lah] [kan]
normal
if you're not on your toes means you're too comfortable what
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
I know
I mean you just
you just want to know for yourself or you want to help other people
coping mechanism
yes
suspicions
I mean
degrees and diplomas they are not cheap
so <malay>nak kena</malay> make sure [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> make sure <malay>betul-betul nak</malay> yes
time dedication
don't let it be just a simple [oh]
<malay>macam</malay> interesting [jer]
(mm)
personally like based on your achievements already right you already have architecture mass comm and business
so
they can all be interrelated right you can make a business out of architecture and you can
promote it through mass comm yes
psychology is something you can take on <malay>tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa</malay>
yes
<malay>sekarang ini bila nak ambil ini ada tak yang perlu</malay>
time <malay>duit</malay> and <malay>betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja</malay>
(uh) well <malay>selalunya orang cakap</malay> two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
diploma first
still need three out of three still need time and dedication
but <malay>tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil</malay>
<malay>ada duit ada</malay> time <malay>tapi kalau tak ada</malay> dedication <malay>macam buang masa</malay>
[ah] so you need all three
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you <malay>ada</malay> [lah] these three
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
<malay>perangai melayu</malay> yes
<malay>habis</malay>

that's why
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>fikir pasal duit</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang memang</malay> okay
but <malay>kalau nak ambil</malay> one more
financially taxing item can you cope or not
and <malay>kalau</malay>
(mm)
wet tissue
personal <malay>betul</malay>
nineteen
they will get the gist
why <malay>kenapa</malay>
(hmm)
<malay>nak tetapi</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ambil lesen</malay>
<malay>tak nak ambil sebab nak kena ambil nak ambil sebab nak ambil</malay>
<malay>sekarang tak nak sekarang macam</malay>
<malay>nak fikir pasal sekolah</malay> so <malay>kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena</malay> divide
exciting <malay>itu memang</malay> [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>pun tak ada kereta</malay>
ya <malay>tetapi kalau tak ada macam</malay>
<malay>kalau tak ada</malay> use for <malay>kereta</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> waste of time <malay>itu sahaja</malay>
and
ya [lah] I <malay>sudah biasa sangat naik</malay> public transport
(mm)
[orh]
yes I still want to go to america I still want to see new york
even
ya and pretty much every political thing there
really just clashes with the fact that I wear hijab
yes
like before trump
if I were to go there I would still be
discriminated discriminated against just for wearing my hijab
then after trump it was even worse now is is
also very worse
ya but now is and is also still is not finished [lah] I mean
ya everything everything now is all about race in america
(mm)
(mm)
also you heard about the paris right

(err) you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a <malay>bilik</malay> or a room <malay>yang</malay> like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with [lah] correct or no
ya [lah] correct [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I think you you both have to think what's the budget [lah] so budget actually <malay>berapa</malay> is it a combined wedding <malay>ke</malay
(mm) okay okay [lah] then I think <malay>kita</malay> we have to take a look part by part [lah] [kan] like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and (um) so basically is between like (err) in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
[oh] ya [lah] that one I think normal [lah] since my time many years ago also same also [lah] the thing ya so I think (uh) ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for [lor] at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least [lah
[oh] because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need [kan] <malay>macam</malay> lik
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
(mm) I think I think in this case [ah] I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like [ah
which one you want to cut down [ah] on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say (uh) if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat [lah] because apparently like <malay>macam</malay> flat <malay>kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat</malay> !chey! <malay>sepanjang hayat</malay> [ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
like I say (uh) the the most important thing is the the the <malay>nikah</malay> itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
more fundamental [lah] but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya #gemod# [lah] #gemod# is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know (uh) his side [ah
hundred fifty ya [seh] hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise [lah] it's lik
(um) family support have to come in so that's why that day you all <malay>kena macam</malay> plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture [lah] that [one] have to be very like (um
(um) very like (uh) transparent but in the event if let's say both side <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you <malay>ada</malay> your own plan of your (uh) I mean his side <malay>ada dia punya</malay> own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to <malay>fikir</malay> or think about i
like okay in that case we do separate [lah] that is another alternative [ah] other alternative then your side then [ah] then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech [oh] !wah! like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb <malay>tak</malay> so that is another another way [lah] [kan] <malay>macam kita nak</malay> (um) try to put everything in hand [lah
so wedding time at least your side <malay>macam</malay> okay then for your side (uh) you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget [eh] sometimes <malay>kita kena fikir</malay> that in terms o
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in <malay>kita punya (err) <malay>orang melayu kita macam</malay> sensitive [ah] about <malay>duit ni</malay> so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families <malay>belum</malay> sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about <malay>duit pun kita adik-beradik masih</malay> sensitive <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [eh] just <malay>bang aku mau pinjam duit kau</malay> [lah] <malay>satu ribu macam suka suka</malay> [jer] <malay>nak minta [kan] abang</malay> you know I have to be like more tactful to u
<malay>kak</malay> are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case <malay>lagi</malay> the other party <malay>yang</malay> your parents <malay>belum kenal</malay> [kan] and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
(uh) bottom line you both must tel
(err) got two choice if want to combine the
then (err) you and #hairin# you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you [dah] sample among all again okay [lah] <malay>kita</malay> work combine then okay celebrate <malay>buat</malay> combine <malay>tapi</malay> if let's say [oh
[ah] you know [lah] I still want my one thousand guest let's say #hairin# <malay>punya</malay> side the
your mother say okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] based on your budget <malay>kita</malay> invite <malay>saudara mara dekat</malay> [jer] one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
extra guest whereas for his (uh) no need then you [leh] you just you just invite [lah] whoever that is important between your lis
because there are two factors you need to think first (um) <malay>kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak</malay> because you all just become a new family member secon
(err) then is like you al
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup [lah] <malay>tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh</malay> then after this the next time <malay>dia pergi rumah</malay
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say [ah
like <malay>macam</malay> (err
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get (err
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
and then july got a flat [ah] my <malay>kita punya</malay> timeline two years <malay>tu nak engage</malay
you know then <malay>tak tahu macam mana tahu</malay> bought flat then because [ah] because <malay>atuk</malay> said better
<malay>cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri</malay> then after that we are like [ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] haywire all I received only fla
<malay>kita punya</malay> like dream wedding <malay>kita punya</malay> dream vacation <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] flash toilet [jer] <malay>tu begitu</malay> [ah] so it's lik
then after that I think (um) at that tim
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
(um) <malay>makanan tapi</malay> [kan] shamefully I have to admit even I [dah] work that time [kan] I <malay>tak boleh</malay> afford [tau] because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like <malay>macam</malay> even like you know the bridal like you all have all these [ah] then I think I can only afford the photos <malay>begitu</malay> that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even <malay>hantaran nak</malay> exchange [ah
(um) I think quite I I would say I like <malay>macam</malay> drag it [lah] but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> I think in the en
we buy some things on our sid
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay [lah] why not <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk</malay> exchange <malay>hantaran</malay
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all [lah] ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually (um) pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push [ah] you no need to type [ah] you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes [ah] food [ah] food dishe
(uh) the equipment that include all the (err) the <malay>kompang</malay> and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so <malay>kita kena tengok macam mana</malay> [lah] [kan] so is lik
you will you will see like [ah] how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
(uh) tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of [eh] (um
<malay>orang melayu kita ni</malay> actually (err) come with a lot of (err) <malay>gotong royong</malay> even though <malay>kita tak sekampung</malay> [lah] not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like <malay>macam pinjamkan kereta</malay> you know so when if you no
(err) how to say #farah# see you just like okay [lah] whatever people (uh) rent you okay [lah] something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like <malay>macam</malay
(uh) certain relative got this car whatever they say [eh] I #chope# your car <malay>dulu</malay> for the coming wedding can or not just ask [lah
you know or maybe like <malay>dekat dekat</malay> wedding <malay>tu</malay> you ask becaus
(uh) <malay>dulu</malay> I in this case usually [lah] people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
(uh) we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar [lah] [pe] [seh] joke [ah] I'm not racist [tau] but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing [lah] so it was just like <malay>kita</malay> like just focu
(uh) what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place [lah] then after that (uh) if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
(uh) then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
<malay>ataupun</malay> early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out <malay>agak agak</malay> because by that time you [dah] start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly <malay>berapa</malay> one month <malay>berapa dapat</malay> sav
so basically you can <malay>agak agak</malay> already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one [ah
[ah] so then from there [oh] then you all like [oh] okay [lah] then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
[ah] so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline [lah] so that even though you got five months (uh) to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say #khatib# (uh) when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like (uh) the cabinet or whatever because I believe (uh) you got to check that one [lah] renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask (err) K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this [lah] there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that [ah] so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it [lah] that is one part of it ya so ya [lah] so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care [kan
my only thing is that okay if he's (uh) you all have to like let's say workout [lah] the thing [lah] workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it (uh) on i
[oh] I think (uh
this one take time [lah] but again (uh) I think #hairin# (uh) or or #hairin# [lah] <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] (uh) maybe is t
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because (uh) you <malay>ini</malay> [kan] actually <malay>masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>yang mereka</malay> seems like okay okay <malay>tapi tak</malay> okay <malay>kot</malay
ya <malay>memang</malay> [lah] (um) to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like <malay>macam secara</malay> positive ya so at least that <malay>macam</malay> you know what you can (um) do best within this (err
(uh) constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it [lah] so let's talk about happy things [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stress [jer] <malay>cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita</malay> happy <malay>pulak dalam pasal pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ni</malay
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okay actually that time you got share with me [kan] <malay>tentang mak andam</malay> like quality of <malay>mak andam</malay
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan [lah
ya okay <malay>macam itu kira</malay> not too bad [lah] [kan] because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like <malay>macam</malay> prepare and then both both parents are okay [ah] it's just anyway you also have time also <malay>nak</malay> save money you kno
but then you have to stay in one place for two years [lah] or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking (err) is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay [kan] then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that [ah
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because (um) certain country [dah] already open [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> you can just like chill relax [lah] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam nak fikir fikir sangat</malay> [kan] then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house [ah] that's another advantage [lah
[ah] <malay>ini pun</malay> if let's say both side okay [lah] I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like <malay>kita macam</malay> like okay [jer] like <malay>nikah</malay> is that correc
[oh] I think that part can't be helped right we all <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam</malay> happy happ
know you are like can can just like (uh) <malay>kita sama sama</malay> you know <malay>ramai ramai meraikan</malay> !chey! <malay>macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>saja mengeratkan silaturahim</malay> so I think can [lah] I think we jus
(uh) take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming [lah] so there's one one idea you can hav
[ah] but now I think for now don't take it as (uh) <malay>macam sedih nak kahwin</malay> [kan] you just more like if all the all the (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time [lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both <malay>kena bincang</malay
<malay>sebaiknya</malay> like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month <malay>macam kena ada</malay> like your own goals [lah] but if let's say if both of you like very <malay>nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want <malay>nak buat</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>biarlah</malay> you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
(um) to prioritise [lah] then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say family <malay>kata</malay> [oh] no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit [lah] [ah] okay option one I let go the fla
you can have the big wedding but (err) we have to burden one of the side [lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat [lah] [kan
[ah] that's another option [lah] that means to get a resale flat maybe <malay>dalam</malay> three five years that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] you know our relativ
some of them <malay>ada</malay> so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like (uh) just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
okay so (err) if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you know [ah] <malay>sendiri sendiri yang macam nak</malay> spend [lah] so if let's say if this side <malay>kata</malay> okay <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
[ah] then okay then so <malay>semua boleh</malay> centralised <malay>atau pun nak</malay> separate <malay>itu</malay> another one [lah] [ah] because I thin
about <malay>tunang</malay> he can never be meet everywhere [lah] [kan] like <malay>macam semua</malay> happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam boleh</malay
then okay [loh] <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> [oh] too bad [lah] because (um) either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then (uh) so you spend lavishly [ah] your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
for you to (uh) come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor [lah] okay then if there's an option two that both parties <malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] why not we bought (uh) you know <malay>yang</malay
norms [lah] <malay>sederhana</malay> [jer] like very minimal number of (um) (err) what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it [lah] finish okay [dah] <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> [lah] that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion (uh) of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like <malay>macam tahu</malay> okay <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount <malay>kita ada ni kita boleh</malay> prepare <malay>macam ini</malay> [ah] then [ah
<malay>orang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang mampu macam ini</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan] like it's like you know we can't be #bo# #chap# in everything <malay>sebab</malay> we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that (err) you <malay>apa ni</malay
[oh] ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide [lah
[ah] what they want [lah] [ah] because I thin
(err) for you both all you want is just <malay>nikah</malay> maybe take beautiful pictures go (err) nice honeymoon then [dah] <malay>habis</malay> then after that focus <malay>kat rumah</malay
[oh] okay okay <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is (err) more important than <malay>hantaran hantaran</malay> is culture <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is <malay>agama</malay
[ah] so <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is part of the (err) <malay>macam dalam dalam</malay> term <malay>dia dalam</malay> arab is called <malay>maha</malay
so <malay>maha</malay> is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount <malay>yang kita dapat tu</malay> minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken <malay>yang kasi</malay> the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
[ah] you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which <malay>negeri</malay> ya <malay>dia orang lagi</malay> emphasise <malay>mas kahwin</malay> then a gift gift <malay>tu hantaran</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi dia orang</malay> [ah] that is culture <malay>melayu kita ni terbalik</malay> [ah
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] gift <malay>tu lebih</malay> high <malay>daripada mas kahwin</malay> but right it should be another way but I think (err) <malay>mas kahwin ke</malay
(err) <malay>hantaran</malay> (err) for me [lah] I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents <malay>cakap tak nak ambil</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way (err) sometimes <malay>rilek</malay> [jer] [lah
(err) you can have the best of both worlds [kan] <malay>jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi</malay> important [lah] [kan] [ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already [dah] <malay>pening kepala</malay> [lah] [kan] like very (um) you know so you you just got to <malay>doa</malay> for awhile <malay>rilek</malay> you know don't need to thin
(err) so in detail yet but at least to think okay now <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] you know what is among all these things <malay>yang macam</malay
(err) mix up what is it like like you think that [oh] what I want to have [oh] I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it [lah
like you can because you think things that you can control <malay>macam</malay> budget photographer your brother [ah] these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that [ah] if let's say for example [ah] we exchange (err) three <malay>saja</malay> [lah] item let's say for exampl
okay [ah] for example [a'ah] <malay>cuma satu</malay> I this one I don't know [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I should have known luckily I never [ah] exchanged <malay>quran</malay> do you know that what is i
in other in one I read about in (err) on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing [lah
like (uh) okay so <malay>jada</malay> is common <malay>tapi</malay> [seh] <malay>jada kita tahu</malay> you will be used for (um) after marriage in when we play together but when talking about <malay>quran</malay> and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you <malay>hantar al quran</malay
I don't okay y
you mean the <malay>hantaran</malay
both side actually exchange gift [ah] how many you want to have it depend
[oh] <malay>duit</malay> that one that one is the <malay>mas [eh] <malay>ini</malay> not <malay>mas</malay> [kan] that one is (err) !alah! <malay>hantaran</malay> [lah] ya [lah] but some give cheque [ah] nowaday
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow [lah] no need [lah] I pay now [loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it [lah] ya if you ask me can be cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha
okay what righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> what but inside is PayNow [leh] is direct transfe
[ah] so is all depends [lah] but again if follow tradition ya [lah] they want to see for real to sure <malay>masih</malay> cash you know you know bank not
[ah] but I think in today's context can be just lik
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but <malay>mesti</malay> there's a transaction and PayNow
if not screen shot and then you se
(mm) it happens [ah] actually happens during my time also is like [oh] because they only said [lah] when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so [ah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot <malay>tapi</malay> to know each other's partner is very very important so i
if let's say you know the [oh] your partner [ah] really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either (um
like I said [lah] is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
(uh) get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like (err) like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
so I think like this (uh) family support is one factor very very important to me [lah] that's why (err) I mean culturally <malay>kita melayu</malay> is very united <malay>satu hati</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> you know [lah] we are lik
we always like (um) always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples <malay>susah</malay> even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also [lah] but the thing is like people also like <malay>sibuk</malay> and go and go and comment y
ya [lah] she wants the opinio
[oh] it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that <malay>tapi</malay> out there maybe <malay>dia pakai</malay> card card card <malay>tapi tak</malay> shar
[ah] there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like (err) the person (uh) then where the family said firmly talk [oh] it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that (uh) kind of situations o
per per per person or individual like that like <malay>macam tak tunjuk</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay
(err) like no communication with their families feel like <malay>tak tunjuk</malay> or what [lah] ya so that can happen [tau] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak tak tak ada</malay> then why you ask me after seven years dating <malay>pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke</malay> [kan] maybe all the while the guy only show up front [oh] <malay>aku ada hadiahkan</malay> best best you kno
[ah] <malay>dia bukan pun tak tunjuk</malay> kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging [eh] <malay>macam berlakon</malay> staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating [ah] but some people ya carry on maybe like for example <malay>dia</malay> partner no [ah
the other party <malay>tu tak ada duit</malay> maybe <malay>tak</malay> you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe [lah] should be okay [lah] <malay>nanti kahwin pun</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam sekarang</malay
(um) he has so many money <malay>aku minta pun</malay> okay [jer] [ah] you know sounds like but I the end when the person say [oh] (uh) he's in debt for the wedding <malay>ini</malay> ya actually that is not the only on
I think <malay>dari zaman</malay> our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P #ramlee# sho
[ah] lie [lah] borrow the #chetty# [lah] you know that that particular #chetty# will always just borrow lend the money to them what (um) high interest and then end up <malay>hutang</malay> because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
(err) kills the that particular portion [lah] but in this younger generation in your generation (err) things have changed progressivel
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> family understand family <malay>tahu</malay> what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them !wah! very have good job then they get flat <malay>dengan</malay> with their pa
they cannot even get flat [eh] they must buy a condo or private propert
[ah] high ceiling income but then (err) there's one period of time he changed jo
so there's (uh) about three months is like or four months ya <malay>tak</malay> start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know [ah] and then they finally got it [ah] then but there's a word then the reaso
(err) a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple [lah] ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no [lah] to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already [ah
that's why he told me [lah] [kan] so like <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>kelakar</malay> then I was like abby you all <malay>gaji</malay> seventy eight thousand [dah
like very stress then me [leh] then ho
then like let me [oh] <malay>mampus</malay> [ah] like that like that then he said no [lah] it's just tha
(uh) you know the more th
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like (uh) like <malay>macam peribahasa melayu apa</malay> the <malay>apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
[ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] don't know [lah] there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that [lah] which I always think [oh
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception (um) but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
to know you usually parents [ah] whether to let go kids to <malay>kahwin</malay> I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
you know and [ah] both ways [lah] both parties [lah] so (uh) people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects [lah
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich [lah] right no need to be like so <malay>kaya</malay> or whatever you just need to have like (um
[ah] more than enough like can start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you can pay your bills you know you can you can (uh) you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
(err) want to want to buy a normal <malay>sayur</malay> or <malay>kangkung</malay
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say [ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
(um) when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my <malay>anak</malay> when all of you come to me my <malay>anak anak saudara</malay> ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision <malay>apakah</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you <malay>nak</malay> make sure tha
you start something that with no <malay>hutang</malay> you know because basically you you start something with <malay>hutang</malay> you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know <malay>hutang</malay> [lah] [kan] you will have you got kids already <malay>hutang</malay> will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing [lah] [ah] because <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kita anak anak sultan</malay> #johor# <malay>ke</malay> daughters <malay>sultan</malay> daughters of <malay>sultan</malay> johor can [lah
[ah] then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
but the thing don't let it kill you [lah] that's why I said (err) in this case [kan] <malay>suka ke tidak</malay> instrinsic back breakdown <malay>tu kena ada</malay
[ah] introduce you must have really must have because if not [lah] if you ask me [lah] !wah! very #jialat# [lah] like every everything also must <malay>risau</malay> bu
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then (um) you can't convince your parents lik
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> convince like that <malay>macam</malay> like for example [ah] you kno
fathers [oh] <malay>mesti nak ada lima ratus</malay> okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents [ah] okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sembarang</malay> [ah] he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point <malay>apa-apa suka hati</malay> okay [lah] <malay>korang</malay> [dah] plan [kan] okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay
[ah] <malay>engkau</malay> continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin

okay
(mm)
what type of superpower I want [ah]
(err) <malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower maybe I want to be someone like maybe bat man or iron man
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
because (err) even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
(um)
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
(um) ya it's not a
(err)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada duit lepas tu boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>orang yang susah</malay>
(err) to fight crime
like
(err) and they don't just fight
(err) those on earth
<malay>orang pun lawan</malay>
people from
the aliens
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
both of them ya
how about you
you <malay>nak jadi apa</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
okay <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
bat batman or iron man
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>takpe</malay> K [ah] basically [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
superpower <malay>yang</malay> best is superpower <malay>untuk terbang</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> that that <malay>kalau</malay> if like one
specific
ability is to fly
<malay>itu</malay> [jer]
(mm)
(mm)
(err) okay <malay>juga</malay> but who has teleporting
powers
doctor strange (mm)
(uh)
[oh]
(mmhmm) harry potter <malay>betul pun</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
<malay>yang</malay> the one <malay>yang</malay> ron weasley injured <malay>tu</malay> ya that [one]
(mm)
(mm)
port key <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang satu</malay>
I <malay>lupa</malay> [ah] <malay>tu punya</malay> scene
<malay>mana satu</malay> [eh] <malay>tu lupa</malay> [eh]
[ah]
ya hogwart that [one] [ah]
okay <malay>kalau</malay> magic
[ah]
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
I'll change mine to either flying or running fast <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation [ah]
teleportation boring [ah]
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train [kan] you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
<malay>untuk</malay> while you <malay>naik atas</malay> mountain
okay if like <malay>lagi laju lagi cepat juga</malay>
<malay>sekejap saja</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
you can help people <malay>apa</malay> you can distribute your money away
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
<malay>tapi ni</malay> superpower <malay>bukan senyum</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(um)
(mmhmm)
(mm) but people need [what]
okay when you are rich you might not feel that [oh] money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million [lah] not not like that [lah]
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
homeless <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know you build one condo just for homeless people in the world to live in <malay>macam gitu</malay>
no you should
(mm)
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
(err)
let them (err)
<malay>bayar sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>kira air dengan api semua bayar sendiri</malay>
<malay>tapi rumah tu</malay> maybe they difficult to <malay>beli</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay>
think <malay>dapat rumah tu</malay> free
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
those simple simple <malay>sudah</malay>
<malay>rumah</malay> just for them to live <malay>apa</malay> then after that
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
(mm)
no it's not unlimited <malay>duit</malay> for yourself
it's a
power
[ah]
[ah] where you can give to people
(uh huh)
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
<malay>pun boleh juga</malay>
(mm)
but how
I think that [one] is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that (err) no need to work [lah]
because I can just live with the with the <malay>ubat</malay> and all
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that [eh] why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
<malay>orang</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mm)
magic <malay>lagi</malay>
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe (err)
(err)
(err) superman is boring [lah] or maybe the flash
or
(err) <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
<malay>siapa yang canggih sekarang lupa</malay> [ah]
(mm)
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
(uh)
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
(uh) superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
feminist <malay>ke dia</malay>
(mm) but the <malay>dia apa</malay> she's brought up in a feminist environment
(mm) (mm)
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
(mmhmm)
<malay>dia bukan tak boleh tua dia lambat tua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>mati</malay>
okay next
no no that [one] they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
ya I I <malay>tahu tapi</malay> from what I read is
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
<malay>orang</malay> clone so they <malay>tapi dia ingat macam</malay> [oh] this is actually the person <malay>tapi</malay> actually <malay>bukan</malay>
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one [lah] who will fight
wonder woman
(err) something like that [lah] the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
of the people in the past something like that <malay>macam gitu</malay> (err) <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] [lah]
<malay>dah dah habis</malay>
<malay>dah habis</malay> film <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekarang tinggal</malay> production <malay>lambat saje keluar pasal</malay>
<malay>dia dia orang tengah kira-kira</malay> pros and cons of
(err) letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once [mah]
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
yes so they <malay>dia orang takut</malay> impact
stream
(mm) video on demand <malay>ke apa</malay>
apple (uh)
<malay>lagi apa</malay> ya [lah] Netflix <malay>ke apa</malay> all those [kan]
ya right
ya
apple apple [lah] the I
games movies <malay>ada</malay> you <malay>bayar untuk</malay>
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
(uh)
something like <malay>dia orang ada</malay>
<malay>dia orang dah ada dah</malay>
they don't have the new movies <malay>belum lagi berani</malay> [lah] go into this
they'll new movies will go into
that [one] produce by Netflix that's why they do that
but you those not produce by Netflix is those produced by Warner Brothers the they <malay>dia orang masih belum berani untuk</malay>
free
[ah]
so
<malay>macam tu kalau</malay> this [one] <malay>keluar</malay> movies
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
<malay>orang orang bayar untuk</malay> subscribe to Netflix to watch their movie
[ah] that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
(uh) this is how they fund their movies
<malay>dia punya tu</malay> advertisements <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>kalau dia orang buat letak kat tu</malay> people will unknowingly buy it [mah]
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
<malay>nak beli juga</malay> I
<malay>nak beli juga</malay> or maybe some merchandise or or <malay>apa</malay> I <malay>beli juga</malay>
that's how they make money [lah] it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
<malay>bukan tu</malay> [jer] <malay>yang dia orang</malay> look for they look for streams they look for
(err) people new subscribers <malay>masuk</malay> people who
subscribe and (err) upgrade their
account
upgrade <malay>akaun dia orang</malay>
from one person only
<malay>boleh tengok</malay> to
three people or five people family <malay>punya</malay> account [ah] that's how they make the money
and also from the advertisement [lah] because for every movie <malay>mesti ada</malay> the sponsors <malay>siapa masuk</malay>
<malay>nak macam</malay> let's say Nike wants to be in in
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>macam gitu dia orang buat duit</malay>
let's say
<malay>dia</malay> promise
ya maybe <malay>dia dah</malay> promise
for like maybe <malay>dia nak tunjuk satu kopi</malay>
where your coffee maker say for every minute that you show me I will they will <malay>bayar</malay> a certain amount
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
movie <malay>macam gitu</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah]
they can they are they are free to pay any amount [mah] to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] you you
you fast forward [eh] you
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>pasal tak tak dapat faham betul-betul cerita jalan cerita</malay>
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>buang sampah</malay> I
<malay>siapa juga yang buat</malay>
okay <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> you you <malay>tengok</malay> movie <malay>tu sudah tidur</malay>

ya
[oh] (uh) today <malay>pergi sekolah apa</malay>
<malay>bapak</malay>
<malay>kerja</malay> [ah]
[oh]
[oh] so how many [ah] <malay>dua kali</malay> [ah] one week one week <malay>dua kali</malay> [ah]
[oh] then (uh) how how's your job search
then (um)
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now [eh] all the interview [ah]
the developer they [eh] you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
[ah] interview maybe <malay>yang</malay> second time [ah] second time <malay>dia orang suruh ambil</malay> this kind
this kind of coding test [kan]
[oh]
no I mean (uh) <malay>bukan yang bukan</malay> [tau] the the one at (uh) what you call that
the the you must type the code inside
that one you that one <malay>tak boleh</malay> search <malay>apa</malay> online
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
(mm)
okay
(um) <malay>tak</malay>
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
[ah] I think they really keep calling you know
yesterday there's <malay>ada satu</malay> interview [eh] recruiter [kan]
it's like
what's the word [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
very pushy [ah] so like
like you know like you ask them to call back [kan] <malay>abeh dia cakap</malay> [ah] no only two minutes <malay>macam</malay> a bit annoying [ah] you know
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
[ah] what is the maximum [lah] the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm [ah] [kan] because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit [ah] pointless [kan]
so like
<malay>orang melayu cakap</malay> (um) <malay>jangan apa</malay>
[ah] I forgot the word lowball [ah] something like lowball [ah]
no no value [ah] [kan]
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
most of the job <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> !aiya! it's like contract it's not really [ah]
it's not permanent [ah] but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
that is that makes sense [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> nobody will also <malay>macam</malay>
be eager to you know (um) ya
join the company like this
[ah] mostly
full time but because <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] I teach tuition [kan]
so tuition
but ya that's why
no but tuition only left <malay>lagi dua bulan</malay> [ah] until (um) october [kan] O level <malay>atau</malay> N level [kan]
so that time middle of october [kan] so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months [ah] [kan] so actually
last week I just start (um) this new student [ah] <malay>budak melayu</malay> [ah] <malay>budak apa</malay> N level [ah] N level <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit batok#
I think one or two weeks before [ah] two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right [ah] so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest [ah] maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same [ah] one week difference I think
the normal tech
!huh!
ya
no I think now they they make more centres [ah] I think they I think <malay>dia orang</malay> there's no way they can do in a big hall [what] [kan]
because like the hall
it's like a big group [ah] then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
then <malay>yang</malay> students <malay>yang lain</malay> all <malay>pergi</malay> normal classroom [ah]
I think same time [ah] the the whole singapore <malay>mesti</malay> same time [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> later how to know that you know
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better [lah] until october
I think part time got got a a lot job [ah] <malay>macam yang</malay> this (um)
<malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] (um)
data entry [lah] you know those
just typing on excel [kan] basic [ah]
[ah] office [ah] and typing or sending email those basic admin work [ah]
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description [kan] is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said (um) they said okay monday to friday the timing is (um) I think
about five to ten [ah] or four to ten like five hours [ah] or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
for part time <malay>mesti</malay> commit
(um) for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply (um) sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear [ah]
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer [ah] so
for me best is (um) data analsyt <malay>atau</malay> business analyst
<malay>atau</malay> system analyst [ah]
like but mostly mostly also must support [ah] because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
<malay>kena</malay> twenty four seven support
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support [kan]
so phone support is a bit too much [ah] you know
[ah] that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
it's like like to me not much difference right <malay>kalau</malay> work from home then
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
I think python <malay>macam</malay> python for me is okay [lah] because it's a
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable [kan] it's a it's it's python programming considered high level [kan]
actually high level is the the code that <malay>macam</malay> can be readable [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay> if a human being <malay>baca</malay> the code
(uh) they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
(mm)
[ah] there's this code thing called fortran right <malay>betul tak</malay>
it's called [ah] fortran
A N ya
then what <malay>ni apa</malay> this there's this language <malay>namanya</malay> C hash [eh] <malay>apa</malay> C hash [eh] is it
is it C hash or something hash
[ah] C sharp
!huh! golac
G G O L A C [eh]
[oh] golang
but it's (um) the pace is what like <malay>dia ikut</malay> which (um) which language
(mm)
okay then
because
I don't really like to like build you know <malay>macam</malay> build all the app
building [kan]
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these [ah] data and then maybe
a bit of support [ah] the support kind of role [ah]
because like for me last time I work in a bank [kan]
<malay>ingat tak</malay> (um) during the year twenty
twenty nineteen [ah] twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
[kan]
that time I work in a bank [kan] so
my job mostly like [ah] then investigate [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
so (um) laymans [kan] the back end [ah] so
you know logs [kan] you know logs
L O G S [ah] log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
[ah] error error <malay>dia akan</malay> email [kan] so times ten [kan] times ten
go to back end and then take everything out [lah]
then investigate maybe or something
(um) the front part is a investigation [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay> need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
but the it's like ticket [ah] like they say what
support and ticket and then
(uh) raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close [ah]
then last what you call that analyse [ah] whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite (um) interesting or it's it's quite a
like enriching to do this kind of work but <malay>yang tak suka</malay> is the I really <malay>benci</malay> is support twenty four seven on the phone [ah]
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called (uh) run the bank [ah] not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means (um)
it means that the the app is ongoing [ah] you understand like it's not a project [ah] that means the project already finish that means it's live [ah] live product being used by users [ah]
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china (uh) all this so the timezone all weird weird [one]
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us [what]
ya then their working hours until our six [what] so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues [what] I think there's only one period that
the like not say down time [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
low low what low traffic [eh]
[ah] nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven [ah] because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead [what] only [lah] then just wake up [what] that time
because there's two countries new york [eh] no two states
new york and where [ah] san francisco right [ah]
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server [ah]
I don't think so [ah] or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank [ah] our local bank so ya the business not so much [ah]
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this [ah] this basic functions [ah] [kan]
[oh] they call it the green [eh] green lane [eh]
but but
we cannot go right
<malay>nenek boleh pergi balik</malay> [ah] <malay>nenek</malay>
ya but somebody must handle that [what]
(um) I think <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] but [eh] but <malay>dia</malay> right <malay>yang syakilah iman</malay> is maybe [ah] I think
they can come
[ah] they they can say [ah] ya they can use the fact that their house right at #clementi# need to do something [ah] right collect the mail the mailbox [ah] because
[eh] I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think <malay>berlambak</malay> [ah] mail <malay>dia</malay>
(um)
but the the tenant [kan] you know the [eh] now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail [ah]
who
okay
no [ah] [oh] auntie I always just say <malay>cik cik rozi</malay> [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> something [ah]
cousins (uh)
they I think busy also [ah]
then <malay>dah</malay> you all <malay>dah makan belum</malay>
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight [ah]
<malay>semua tengah tidur</malay> [kan]
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
<malay>tak dia punya</malay> ingredients [kan] <malay>beli kat pasar atau</malay> (uh)
!huh!
(mm)
so there's money
you mean the <malay>ikan</malay> is the the one that is boneless [eh]
it's not in the fridge [eh]
[oh]
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
(um) <malay>mesti</malay>
fry the [eh] fry the fish first right
ya the sauce right then pour on top [kan] just just <malay>tuang</malay>
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make [ah] <malay>macam</malay> mix and match
<malay>apa apa</malay> ya like
tomato <malay>semua</malay> [ah] tomato (um) pineapple
[ah] capsicum <malay>sedap</malay> I like I like the capsicum
I think the it [ah] the the the preparation is a
the <malay>yang makan masa</malay> [ah] [kan]
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife [ah] hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid [ah]
but it's it's good if you have a maid [ah] but
for for us actually if let's say our our family [kan] <malay>macam nak ada</malay> maid [kan]
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
<malay>kalau siapa dah kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>atau</malay> like we have our own house [kan] maybe separate [ah] let's say I
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house [kan] so one maid right (um) share our #woodlands# house
they maybe my future house or your future house [ah] so then like the maid right
no I mean like one maid [ah] because like the maid <malay>tak payah</malay> just stay at one house do all the work [what] because sometimes <malay>mak ada nenek ada</malay> [kan] so maybe can
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else [ah] like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first [ah]
(hmm)
ya
no but I think
internally [kan] if
the maid is okay then we we must <malay>bayar</malay> for the transport
and maybe give them time off [ah] [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off [ah] right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal [ah] because (um) as long the maid
<malay>tak</malay> complain <malay>atau tak</malay>
feel <malay>macam</malay> pressure [kan] we we like they call it give and take [ah]
don't over over work the maid [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> maid is okay then okay [what] you know
!huh!
normally the maid off sunday [kan] one day off [kan]
ya
this one maybe we can plan ten [ah] next time because <malay>bapak</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua<malay> [kan] <malay>nanti mak</malay>
like at least like the maid <malay>boleh masakkan</malay> actually the best [kan] the maid <malay>masak</malay>
right because if the maid <malay>masak</malay> right then we just need to buy the stuff [ah] then <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh</malay> just order online [kan]
but any online <malay>pasar</malay> or not <malay>macam pasar</malay> food [eh] buy meat or chicken <malay>ada</malay> [eh]
but I mean like the <malay>betul punya pasar</malay> online maybe maybe
no because fairprice <malay>jual</malay> beef <malay>tak</malay> [eh] because beef is very hard to find right
but I think they're a bit
[eh]
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map [kan] is fixed [ah]
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual [ah]
ya then if the stock finish
(um) <malay>macam mana</malay> the person <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh] !wah! cool [ah]
[oh] no [oh] but means the device [kan] then the the user <malay>mesti jalan</malay> to
so call move [ah]
I think no but
I think I think [ah] Singapore difficult because you know why or not
our our house all small [what] america everything is so big [kan] I mean america everything you see <malay>dia punya rumah besar-besar</malay> or I think european some also the house big [kan]
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental [ah]
but the device is (uh) quite <malay>mahal</malay> [kan] I think thousands right
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface [ah] the mapping [kan] the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue [ah] [kan]
so seven days <malay>tak payah pergi kerja</malay> [ah] just somewhere else [ah]
but they they can they will monitor your work [ah]
[oh] ya [ah] standard meeting [ah] [kan]
[oh] last time that time zoom you all also use zoom [ah]
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people [kan] during the COVID
really [ah]
!huh! they going to open here [ah]
ya but singapore smart [ah] I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues [ah]
[oh] good [ah] [ah] are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not [ah] now
ya
[oh] open already [ah] I don't know [ah]
<malay>itu hari cakap</malay> open the ikea but [oh] but now open [lah]
half [ah]
I think half of that
[eh] I think because I think
susah nak apa kita</malay>
[ah] predict the people [kan] because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
[oh] actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those (um)
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what [ah] counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot [ah] like last time I went I went exchange also same [ah] I I
because most people will eat solo [ah] because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so nobody can meet their friends to eat [what] so they just have to eat <malay>cepat-cepat makan</malay> then then just <malay>balik</malay> class [ah]
so
the counter table is like just one person [ah] then you face the you face nobody [ah] like you know face like a the wall or something [ah] so it's like against the wall [kan]
[ah] actually they should make like that
but that that time weird you know [ah] <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa nama kedai dia yang</malay> mister you you know orchid house <malay>dekat</malay> #serangoon# gardens <malay>tu</malay>
orchid house the the indian food <malay>macam mamak</malay> [ah]
<malay>mamak</malay> food
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
<malay>al-azhar gitu</malay> those kind <malay>macam</malay> woodgrove <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
#serangoon# garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor [lah] you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting [ah] like like #al-ameen# at our place the the woodgrove [kan]
ya open concept [ah] like is is like sheltered [lah]
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
phase the first week of phase two [kan] <malay>atau</malay> I think I <malay>jumpa</malay> my friend during the phase two second week [ah] [kan]
phase two is about nineteen june [kan] so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend <malay>makan dekat tu</malay> [ah] orchid house
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person [ah] then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side [tau] that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
<malay>pelik ke</malay> so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird [ah] [kan]
so that means like the four of you [ah] or three of you [kan] will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing [ah] but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then [ah] section off like one table instead of six right become four [lah] you know
I mean they can do that [lah] but I think
maybe today they change [lah] because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
<malay>mesti</malay> customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else [kan] because
because of the <malay>apa</malay> seating arrangement
or if they more than five
and some people they <malay>apa</malay> like they in a group [kan] say eight people [ah] four four [kan]
so I think recently there's a news [ah] then they like to inter change like I think they
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then <malay>bersembang</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan kawan-kawan</malay> [kan]
but I think
but must pity the the business owner [ah] for because actually right like very strict [ah] I mean [eh] it's it's not the [kan]
(uh) [eh] it's so they are very strict [ah]
so
I think some of the
(um) I heard the store owner [kan] <malay>atau</malay> business owner dia orang</malay> call the
[kan] complain [ah] like [oh] call police [ah] I don't know what they call [ah] they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually [oh] at first maybe they ask them to go out [lah] say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
but sometimes we think [oh] it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you <malay>tengok</malay> news
another search [ah] you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy [kan]
ya I think maybe like they have a counter [lah] like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't [ah] what you call that scan out [ah] checkout from the place
[eh] but do do you think it's possible [kan] <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> make a system [kan] means by far away then they auto checkout
[ah] if the person off then <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya the the app <malay>apa</malay> what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
!huh!
[ah] trace together [kan]
[oh] that one
it's good [kan] <malay>macam</malay> but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
[oh] because of bluetooth [ah]
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
[oh]
so like between [ah] android and they also know what to do right
ya
(um)
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google [ah] [kan]
I don't know [ah] because like maybe I want to try Google [ah] but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air [kan]
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini [eh]
actually that one <malay>bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal</malay> you like [eh] !hey! google then the you can play spotify
you can play (um) I mean you can play the [eh] what's it called [ah] the radio station like singapore radio station
[ah] live streaming [ah] as long you got wifi [lah]
so actually from the wifi [eh] but actually dangerous [oh] I realise [kan] they recognise our voice [oh]
the google home speaker [ah] I mean the I mean google home [ah]
because right that time [kan] my friend [kan]
K because my my friend he <malay>dia pakai</malay> google home [eh] google phone [tau] so I use apple [ah] but the that time I stay #punggol# also share with him [kan]
so
I ask google [ah] using my voice [ah] like when is my birthday or what is my age [ah] something
then they know [ah] cause I think like google gmail [ah] all this something
so like they know (uh) something like my birthday or my name [ah]
then because my friend got google phone right
so he use the the what google assistance [eh] <malay>yang cakap</malay> the voice [ah]
[oh] there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker [ah] the google home speaker [kan] then he ask (um) like what is my name or something [ah]
then the google know that it's him then say his name
[ah] or birthday [ah] [ah] I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess [what]
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person [what]
[ah] so a bit scary [lah] I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community [kan] instagram or something [kan]
<malay>dia cakap</malay> even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
[ah] <malay>macam macam mana nak tahu</malay> [ah]
no I mean <malay>macam mana nak nak tahu</malay> that whether they are listening to you or not
but if the wifi off [kan] but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device [kan]
so will it still listen
no I think if let's say [oh] but I think google [kan] <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] if you like ask question [kan] like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say (um) [oh] sorry we cannot
(um) connect you
to the
but default [ah] but if you ask like questions like (um)
something basic [ah] like (uh) what time is it maybe <malay>dia tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tanya</malay> something like (um)
[ah] offline what do you call it offline data [ah]
what basic basic functions [ah] [kan]
ya
it's good [ah]
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon [what] a lot so
my friend [eh] my friend singaporean [kan] but then he <malay>dia</malay> study full time <malay>dekat pergi luar</malay> [ah]
then <malay>dia punya</malay> apartment [kan]
I think because they also got money [ah] so their apartment like one room one bedroom [ah] so like those studio [ah]
then <malay>dia pun ada</malay> alexa I think now alexa better [ah] because
got how many version [ah] I also don't know [ah]
smart home device [ah]
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven [kan] like is there a brand for smart oven now
[oh]
[oh]
got smart shower or not I don't know
[oh] but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there [lah] because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen [ah] I don't know
or voice [ah]
[eh] but that means right COVID better [what] if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene [kan] then I think maybe future [ah] singapore the lift also maybe smart [kan]
or lift system
I think can make right
[oh] the base I mean there's a pedal [kan]
I think that one <malay>bukan</malay> maybe that one is it thailand something [ah] I cannot remember
[ah] the [ah] the <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh] [ah] this place [ah] that time I went interview #tanjong pagar# go it's called what guoco tower [ah]
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working [ah] so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens [kan] too many screen one is left one is right [kan]
so when you tap [kan] <malay>dia dia tahu</malay> which which place to go to [ah] like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down [what]
because you card is only one level [ah]

then I just I just went like I just attended the meeting [ah] and then after that they like the the
the membership the program itself is like it's quite interesting you need to like you only have to clock in ten thousand steps a day like for five days out of seven days a week and then you get like cashback you get like vouchers and stuff like that which I thought was pretty cool
but then after that they started asking me about my savings
like they started to ask me like (err) are you are you a a thrifty spender like how do you save your monthly allowance like when do you receive your allowance when they kind of thing and then

I don't know okay but anyway anyway there's this (uh) job application for #jurong# bird park !huh!
got #jurong# bird park is hiring
[oh] serious
you don't want [ah]
ya junior zookeeper (uh) junior birdkeeper
<malay>kenapa</malay> [eh]
(err) do you think we should stop the recording now
okay but you have to keep
talking because
you
but if I talk and then you don't respond to me then what's the point of me talking
okay but so are you checking it now
should we just end it how do we end it do we just stop or what
now
okay okay okay

<malay>kenapa</malay>
but <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>terkeluar</malay> Zoom
I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
okay <malay>tak apa</malay> I I <malay>ajar</malay> you <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> Zoom <malay>dulu</malay> cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
okay <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I <malay>punya</malay> sign in is just under sign in with <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> personal I would think you have to (um) sign in <malay>pakai</malay>
your own email [lah] <malay>tak</malay> okay but let's just pretend <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> your own email okay
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to (um) another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
(mm)
okay so like <malay>selalunya</malay> when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will <malay>macam</malay> send you a link [kan] then like from from the link you you just
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you [ah] they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
select you can see like my background <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] you it's <malay>apa</malay> (um) it's virtual screen so <malay>maknanya</malay> my background <malay>takleh nampak</malay> [lah]
[ah] so
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> messy <malay>kalau</malay>
yes ya
so you can change like your virtual background [ah] at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I <malay>selalu pakai</malay> virtual background cause <malay>belakang</malay> messy [kan] so I don't want to like show my background so <malay>kalau</malay> it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
then you can you can use their (err)
<malay>tak ni dah</malay> log in <malay>dah</malay>
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you [lah] I'm not sure about your personal [one] but my school [one] has like
(um) my school's background
so (uh) you can also add in your own photo so for me I <malay>macam</malay> I create I even created my own background just to
<malay>bagi lawa</malay> [lah] so I I use this
<malay>tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni</malay> [kan] it's
(err) you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show [lah]
(mm)
K
so background is done and then (um) <malay>apa lagi nak tahu</malay>
(mm)
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet <malay>dengan</malay> iPad I think [ah] ya
so when you click share screen right
I'm not sure about (um) <malay>apa</malay> not android <malay>apa nama dia</malay> Windows <malay>punya</malay> laptop but
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
so <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>pakai</malay> desktop [kan]
it will show everything that I go
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp <malay>punya</malay> web
everybody can see that
but
ya but if I <malay>pakai</malay> if I choose the Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
so even <malay>kalau macam</malay> I <malay>tengah pakai</malay> Google chrome <malay>lepas tu</malay> I open WhatsApp web
<malay>dia tak akan nampak</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> (err) window
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share [lah] share
so like this would be hard <malay>macam</malay> (uh) once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just (um)
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
[ah] you stop share [lah]
ya so you just stop share
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know <malay>selalu macam</malay>
you <malay>selalu cakap</malay> then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper <malay>orang boleh dengar</malay>
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
and then it goes the same for the video [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your video <malay>takde</malay> they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me <malay>dalam</malay> class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak yang tunjuk</malay> you <malay>tadi</malay>
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say (um) they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that [one] is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad <malay>dia akan tanya kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay>
allow
<malay>macam</malay> for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers <malay>tadi</malay> (um)
she chose don't allow
so even <malay>kalau</malay> even <malay>kalau dia</malay>
pick the stop video I mean I mean [ah] like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> video [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
actually you can see yourself [lah] <malay>kat tepi</malay>
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are <malay>apa</malay> the video is done I mean the video is off
<malay>apa</malay> done
(mm)
and then other basic things is like <malay>macam</malay>
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
raise up your hands or (err) <malay>apa</malay>
thumbs up thumbs down
okay I don't really have it [oh] <malay>dengan</malay> yes no
okay so they will just ask [oh] [ah] who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just <malay>angkat tangan</malay>
<malay>tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini</malay> [lah]
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands (uh) put down your hands yes no
(err) thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs [ah] hands up
ya usually at the participants area [lah]
ya then like just now you can like
<malay>apa</malay> rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want #siti# instead
so #siti# ya and then other basic things is (err) okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
so record is just you <malay>boleh tengok balik</malay> [lah] the recording
okay so you can choose between like (err) record on your laptop or record on cloud
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record <malay>macam macam</malay> that time I conduct my master classes right
and then I had to record the classes
[ah] I chose
the first mistake was I chose (uh) to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
<malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so so I had to I had to
<malay>apa</malay>
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then <malay>susah</malay> [lah]
ya then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I just (um) I tried out (uh) record on cloud
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
then <malay>orang akan</malay> just
ya <malay>orang akan</malay> be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
(mm) ya
and then some basic things like chat
chat [ah] okay cause <malay>ni tak ada</malay> participants <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] so
(mm) then you know you can change (err) to everyone <malay>ataupun</malay> to a specific person
(mm) <malay>tak boleh</malay>
<malay>takleh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap yang</malay> like what like the host who
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host (uh) even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer <malay>kat dalam kelas</malay> [lah] ya
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which (err) will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
(uh) instead of everyone there's like person [ah] other people's name all the participants' name [lah] then they will have like bracket privately
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message [kan] you have to make sure <malay>yang apa</malay> you you click back to everyone
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages (uh) your and messages <malay>apa</malay> to everyone
it will be altogether
ya so you just have to <malay>macam baca betul-betul</malay> [lah] like which one is everyone which one is to you only
(mm) ya but that's just like
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to <malay>apa</malay> to to my friend [ah]
(mm) other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
breakout rooms is just (uh) <malay>macam tadi</malay> you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of <malay>macam</malay>
forty people
<malay>lepas tu orang tu nak</malay> breakout into smaller groups to do group work
so I will just
<malay>macam</malay> create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>tengah tengah tengok</malay>
I'll just be like (err) there will just be a notification that pops out (uh) proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait [lah]
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
(mm)
(mm) I guess so [lah] but like
cause
cause for adults I don't think you guys <malay>pakai</malay> much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks <malay>apa</malay>
I get
ya so if you like (uh) if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say <malay>macam</malay> I conduct my fundraising master classes [kan] the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just (err)
it will just be somewhere here [lah]
like ya
(mm) I think it's better than <malay>apa</malay> what's the other option the outlook is it live live
google meet or live outlook something like that [lah]
(mm)
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people [lah]
(mm)
but just now you had you had something on
<malay>ada apa</malay>
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
but it's so <malay>susah</malay> just now
(mm) but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no but like but like what was your <malay>apa</malay> what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room <malay>ada</malay> virtual
I <malay>tak</malay>
I <malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> [lah] but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi susah tak</malay>
[ah]
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay> it's the starting of the
[oh]
I mean technically it's in the poem also [what] so like even if you <malay>baca</malay> like
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
but this is done by the escape room <malay>punya punya</malay> company [lah]
[oh] so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator <malay>macam</malay> team bonding facilitator right
!huh!
the gavin (err)
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation [what]
[oh] then the escape room is they create or what
cause cause got my for my global studies <malay>punya apa</malay>
welfare pack [kan] everything is online now [what] so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> okay basically if it's physical [kan] in school then they will give you like nearing to exams [lah] <malay>macam</malay> your <malay>apa</malay> midterms or your final year then they will give you like (err) a literal goody bag
then inside <malay>macam ada</malay> foolscap <malay>ada</malay> snacks <malay>ada</malay> like ya then like all these are like
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
(err) <malay>apa</malay> get
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff [ah]
promote [ah] sponsorship [ah] sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship [lah] but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty <malay>punya</malay> goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small <malay>apa</malay> faculty group [kan]
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with [lah] so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like (err) cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical [one] or something like that but like
<malay>tapi lima orang apa</malay>
maybe maybe ya then they
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but (um) is to try out our <malay>apa</malay>
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather (um) if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
(um) room <malay>punya</malay> fee
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay [what] to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that [lah]
<malay>tak tak tak kita</malay> play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you <malay>nak orang</malay> (uh) you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want [what] [kan] ya
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
you have to source out for the for the people [lah] but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android <malay>punya</malay> phone
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried [lah] we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
and then cause at first they tried to <malay>apa</malay>
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that [lah] like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
(mm)
and then like initially I wanted to
(uh) produce like three different
E-vouchers for <malay>apa</malay> three different three different categories <malay>macam</malay> welfare [eh] welfare <malay>pula</malay> beauty (uh) food and <malay>macam</malay> activities [lah] like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end <malay>macam</malay> I think they just decided
to produce one instead
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to <malay>macam</malay> we tried to
engage in home-based businesses
<malay>tapi tu pun susah</malay>
like it was supposed to be
release
[oh] it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships <malay>tak</malay> reply cause COVID <malay>sekarang</malay> then even their organisations not doing well <malay>apa</malay> the companies not doing well
like even like activity <malay>punya</malay> entertainment places <malay>pun tak</malay> not
they open [lah] but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
(err) we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
ya then now I just finished my fundraising <malay>punya</malay> series [oh]
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
!woohoo!
ya our target was four hundred dollars
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first <malay>macam kita</malay>
we just like no confidence [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>susah</malay>
four courses [a'ah]
(err) each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my (um)
(uh) members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism [lah] he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also <malay>macam</malay> donate in bulks [what] like you and mama
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
seventy per cent seventy per cent <malay>pula</malay> seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot [what]
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half [lah] like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible [what] it's not to rely on like
just you <malay>sorang</malay> [jer]
[kan] so like that's what he said [lah] he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
(mm) but ya not not there yet not as
(mmhmm) (mm)
ya then we're like that's quite true [lah]
(um) no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is [oh] third is excel and forth is (um)
<malay>apa</malay> embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think <malay>macam</malay> is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that [one] a bit but in the end (err) a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class <malay>macam</malay> it's not that bad [lah] ya
cause it was still <malay>macam ramai</malay> then she was like [oh] my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like [oh] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>nasib baik</malay> cause there's only like
three people <malay>yang</malay> sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people <malay>yang</malay> sign up
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like (err) in our faculty there was there's another group
[oh] by the way I won a giveaway from them
from the faculty <malay>punya</malay> group
ya it's a just a makeup set [lah] ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
[oh] ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
[oh] at first he I don't really know him but I just <malay>tahu pasal</malay> he lives in my for
ya
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance <malay>macam</malay> I saw his (uh)
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time <malay>pasal</malay>
[ah] this excel course [lah] <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> and I wanted to join that time <malay>tapi</malay> I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course [lah] ya
and then fast forward (err)
I was <malay>dengan tengah</malay> planning for this fundraising I was thinking like (hmm) like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> I think
like
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
not hands-on <malay>macam</malay> very practical skills that people would need <malay>macam</malay> in their workplaces in their school right
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him [lah] I was like [oh] will you be interested [oh] I ask his number from my friend and then after that [ah] I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
he was just like ya sure sure <malay>lepas tu</malay> I I went to find out (err) he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like [oh] my god so <malay>kesian</malay> then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
[ah] but ya it's just it's
<malay>dah</malay> I told him already but
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
two and half cause the maximum <malay>kita anuh</malay> is
(uh) two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like (uh) extra class notes and he even like answered (err) post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
[oh] but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
[oh] he was (err) he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like (uh) ya
prestigious one [lah] but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
(mm) really [meh]
(mm) okay [lah] ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like !wow!
how is someone that smart
ya
<malay>esok ada apa</malay>
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
[oh] the Staple B is it
actually I don't even know what's <malay>abang</malay> doing
like what what what did he <malay>macam</malay> in the end

so it's it's just plain rice chicken <malay>dengan</malay> just different sauce
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
[oh]
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at #novena#
<malay>mana</malay> [seh]
I don't know I just go #novena# <malay>untuk</malay> (err) skin centre
so is that good
[oh]
ya but the soft launch <malay>abang nak buat apa</malay>
how is going to earn from that
[ah]
but it's a a like you know like stall in in a food court <malay>ke</malay> in a
in a shopping mall <malay>ke</malay>
so food court [lah]
that's basically a food court
(mm)
that's a food court
okay [lah] like <malay>atas atas punya</malay> food court cause I heard like there's <malay>apa</malay>
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
(mm) no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> it's this semester is all online [kan] I didn't even step in school like for one moment
[ah] it's focus more if your if your room is conducive [lah] but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all [what] I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
(err) go back to school to study <malay>apa</malay>
no at first cannot <malay>sekarang dah boleh</malay>
but <malay>jauh</malay>
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
you <malay>boleh</malay> #tampines# hub is the most not conducive environment ever
like I don't even know how people study in #tampines# hub
it's so <malay>bising</malay> you ever went there before
the basement [kan] you're talking about the basement right
it's so <malay>bising</malay> like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay [lah] understand but like
ya the is twenty four hours [what]
ya I mean how can people go inside without going inside the area
ya
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside <malay>yang kat atas semua</malay> it's so hard
[oh] no cause COVID then now they
[oh] but library now they open
I think
#bugis# the national library and like some bigger national libraries like #tampines# library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online [lah]
but like two hours <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>sikit</malay> if I want to study there
ya and then <malay>nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun</malay>
like I don't mind studying outside but
some establishments <malay>macam</malay> Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is [oh] my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that [one] my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams (err) assignments to do
six
all different [lah] so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
<malay>tapi</malay> it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
twenty four hours [ah]
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam (err) my job <malay>punya</malay> module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to <malay>cam</malay> use all these
your laptop <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can [lah] but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you [lah] but
even if you have friends <malay>macam</malay>
#paiseh# [kan] <malay>nak tanya</malay>
like it's not not
#neh#
no but it was
it was so much time [lah] I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
!huh!
<malay>cakap apa</malay>
no [lah]
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
[oh] you look at
exactly ya
so it's usually like like <malay>apa</malay> a combination of (err) topics
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
[oh] no but
but one thing bad about online school was that (err)
[orh] okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module [lah] but
[ah] generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought <malay>macam lebih lebih bagus</malay> [ah]
no the answer is no
[oh] that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
(uh) non exam modules and two exams <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> happy [lah] !yay! three three modules no exam
[ah] <malay>ambil kau semua</malay> submission at the same time cause usually
like (err)
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually [lah] (err) the <malay>macam apa</malay> submission the deadline is
about the same so let's say
in this (uh) my first mod then my second mod right I have like (um) my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
<malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [lah] but it's just like that [ah]
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
(um) let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
but the assignment like most of my assignments here (um) especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating <malay>nya</malay> assignment
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like [eh] it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like !yay! no exam fun [what] then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like !huh! why I never knew until I experience it
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy <malay>punya</malay> mod
and my major (err)
my major <malay>apa</malay>
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words [lah]
so you you <malay>bayangkan</malay> I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
<malay>semua</malay> yes you see
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major [one]
and then two thirteen november okay then this [one] is okay [lah] relax [lah]
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same <malay>sama-sama</malay>
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two [lah] but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam [what] like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time [lah] then now I think
some period
<malay>macam</malay> now
now and
two [eh] no week six that's the crazy period [lah] cause that's the like now now is my #chiong# period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster [lah]
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you <malay>tak percaya</malay> you <malay>tanya kak</malay> #shima# the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
that's that
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just <malay>belajar</malay> for that one
(uh) like you <malay>belajar</malay> for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
I just got my I just go my <malay>apa</malay>
(err) result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay>
twenty third november <malay>baru</malay> end
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you [lah]
ya
!huh!
[oh] no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments [kan]
then cause different assignments is different weightages <malay>apa</malay>
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case [lah] cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
like like I think it's cause <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
<malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !huh!
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that [what] then I think they don't want [lah]
ya but
I guess it's it's okay [lah]
like
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we <malay>dapat</malay> results you <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did [lah]
ya
ya
it's like
<malay>lagi cepat</malay> stress
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni [lah] I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay [lah] I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
you <malay>naik</malay> year three year four it gets harder and harder [what] you have to take harder modules [kan]
ya and then after that
I just want to <malay>macam</malay> freeze my [lah] so that it won't <malay>macam tak turun tak naik</malay> I mean I mean <malay>naik</malay> is possible it's very hard for you to <malay>naik</malay> [lah] honestly
ya <malay>tak turun</malay> [lah] basically
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
(mm)
(mm)
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like [oh]
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
(uh) our sem two [kan] sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email [lah] they said like [oh] like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
<malay>dorang nak tunggu</malay> vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already [lah] but unfortunately <malay>tak ada</malay> vaccine
so they said cannot [lah] like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there [lah]
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round <malay>punya dah</malay> actually <malay>dah tutup</malay>
but then they just <malay>buka balik</malay> then they said [oh] it's until [oh] it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
ya
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so <malay>macam tak kira kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything [lah]
but the thing is my
my major <malay>punya</malay> requirement is that
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like <malay>macam</malay> group work
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again [lah] cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out [lah] I <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> [lah]
(mm) so sem one but my course my my major <malay>ada</malay> this requirement that you <malay>kena ambil</malay> this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so <malay>kalau</malay> you miss out in sem one <malay>tak boleh ambil</malay> in sem two [jer] [tau]
you have to wait
you have to wait another year [lah] so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do (um) online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause (uh) you're it's actually taking
two (uh) <malay>apa</malay> different modules from two different universities
right
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a <malay>macam</malay> group work <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no it's not
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with (um) just like (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
(uh) doing online <malay>kalau boleh</malay>
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if (uh)
they don't let
if you are <malay>apa namanya</malay> I lost my train of thoughts already <malay>ayah</malay> keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling <malay>pula</malay> it's actually trying to like
take two different (err) from two different schools <malay>macam macam mana</malay> you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck (lah) we just we just trying to ask but
I don't really have hope <malay>yang kita akan pergi</malay> [lah] cause it's ya it's quite hard
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then (um) the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is <malay>macam tak baik</malay> [lah] like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
and obviously the school will not allow it [lah]
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
no <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> one <malay>kalau</malay> one year then I won't [lah] like no and and it's not just them it's like
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore [what] if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can [lah] which is damn unfair cause it's just like
the faculty I mean my major <malay>macam</malay> just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
[eh]
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous [lah]
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
but the the new application <malay>yang dorang kasi</malay> it's more
<malay>apa</malay> there's more options [ah]
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
<malay>kena</malay> submit <malay>lagi</malay> [ah]
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first [ah] so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject <malay>apa</malay> and you and you won't
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options [ah] to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay [lah] no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now [what] it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
you've been looking forward to this but <malay>nasib baik</malay> I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what <malay>takde</malay>
know like <malay>kak</malay> #shima# stay in the hall everything
[oh] ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision [what] remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya [oh] did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know [lah]
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report [lah]
ya but no the thing is
what it what people are mad about is like <malay>macam</malay> the the college <malay>tak</malay>
they don't they don't <malay>dia tak</malay> relay <malay>apa-apa</malay>
(mm) like cause some people notice like
only after two weeks they reported <malay>baru ada</malay> like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
the <malay>laki</malay> [lah]
then like people like
it took two weeks just to <malay>macam</malay> do something then that speaks a lot [what]
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything [lah]
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know [ah] just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni</malay>
<malay>jap jap</malay> and then after that like they and then we were like
(uh) what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release (err) a statement [lah] saying like [oh] increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know [lah] look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
(um) my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know <malay>macam</malay> sensation [lah] like the media just wants to like keep on (uh) saying [oh] again
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like [oh] like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous [lah]
no but but in but <malay>kita punya</malay> people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report [lah] like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic [ah]
like everytime another one comes and then like (uh) yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that [what]

okay clap

very typical
no [lah] nope
this is for the <malay>belakang</malay> or what
(mmhmm)
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] so [lah]
but it's a waste of money we already paid for the laminate thing
I mean we could ask if it's like <malay>macam</malay> like hundred dollars
why don't <malay>kita</malay> just no just
leave see what (uh) just leave it as it is
and maybe like maybe during <malay>hari raya</malay> time we wanna change
and then we change we don't change now
ya
this quite cute <malay>ni</malay>
ya
this [one] got the half half
okay <malay>dah dah</malay>

okay right
so probably (err) I will start [lah]
so my question is regarding the wedding preparation
okay so from my understanding right <malay>apa tu</malay>
the <malay>kadi</malay> is you book the <malay>kadi</malay> from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them <malay>apa tu</malay>
directly [ah]
okay
okay
ya
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] it's okay [ah]
it's okay <malay>tak payah banyak-banyak</malay> then ya
(hmm)
[oh] okay <malay>jadi kalau kadi tu macam</malay> stay further but you select that <malay>kadi</malay> because you prefer also okay [lah] [oh]
(mm) okay
okay I see
okay okay
okay
(mm)
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
[oh] I see that means <malay>kalau</malay> if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
[oh]
[oh] I I I I <malay>takut</malay> what or not I <malay>takut</malay> go in [ah] then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend [kan] then is charges <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
okay
there there there is any amendment (err) there's there's charges [ah] ya
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> on that day is your date available already [lah] on the
[oh] haven't
ya
[oh] okay okay
[oh] I see so <malay>kirakan</malay> before the date available
you go in you select the <malay>kadi</malay> so (err) I mean you play with the form <malay>tapi</malay> you don't submit
[oh]
[oh] I I was thinking of doing that <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>macam takut</malay> #tersubmit# then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference [ah] the the charges [ah] and then ya so but I was also curious [ah] I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very (err) sought much sought sought after [lah] so don't want to make the mistake [ah] then that time you book <malay>masa tu nya</malay> (err) it's a sunday
<malay>mesti</malay> popular [kan] but then (err)
(err) how fast [ah] did did did sold out as in do you like wait the the night when the the date became available or you just wait the next day you submit
[oh]
okay
[ah]
<malay>takut tak dapat</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm) okay cause I also have to settle quite a number of things [ah] cause for #dewi# side [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay> cause the dad is <malay>bukan</malay> is a non-muslim <malay>jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke</malay> I think <malay>sepuluh</malay> then
[oh] [oh]
[oh] I think about ten [ah] ya but <malay>dia ada lagi satu</malay> (err) <malay>punya susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (um) <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak boleh apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau buat dekat</malay> (err) location <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> cannot be <malay>yang</malay> full time staff
so full time staff <malay>sana ada</malay> about <malay>tiga orang</malay> so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english [ah] so my (err) number of <malay>kadi</malay> shrink shrink then <malay>entah abeh sekarang</malay> nowadays I cannot see the <malay>kadi</malay> reviews on the web [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
but the the videos are removed ya so I like
so I also don't know but I know #salim jasman# I saw the video [lah] so I thought
he's okay he's fast I prefer <malay>pasal dia nya dia nya</malay> style is like
<malay>berbual sikit</malay> then go
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) <malay>kadi tu dia</malay> quite quite
very eloquent [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> I <malay>tengok dia nya</malay> video [kan]
[ah] they they drag on
[ah]
ya ya (mm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
ya <malay>pasal sekarang</malay> I know <malay>yang satu kadi ni yang</malay> I identified this #salim jasman# I saw
<malay>cara dia buat macam betul</malay> relax [ah] (err) he just
(err)
I think he is not very particular as long as he can hear the person say and he just proceed
[oh] okay
okay
yup
ya
busy [ah]
okay
(mm) okay (mm) (mm)
okay okay
[oh] okay okay
[oh] the okay (uh huh)
<malay>tapi bagus</malay> [ah] because you <malay>tak ingat</malay> then that means also no stress [lah] <malay>bila baca baca</malay> [jer] [ah]
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds <malay>baku</malay> ya
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga</malay> ya
(hmm) okay I see then ya
<malay>tapi yang kadi tu</malay> is your family <malay>punya</malay> (err) acquaintance [ah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> by then you don't know who that colleague is [lah]
(mm)
ya
okay (mm) okay <malay>jadi kirakan</malay> my plan <malay>sekarang</malay> is to go to the website fill up all the details then <malay>tapi bila dia punya</malay> date available submit straight (mm)
okay
okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tapi dia</malay> to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through [kan] okay
okay
okay same ya
(mm) okay same here okay <malay>jadi kalau</malay> time slot <malay>dia</malay> is (err) <malay>macam mana tu satu kadi</malay> can have more than one time slot [ah]
I mean based on your experience
[oh]
[oh] then ten to twelve will be very (err) quite hot [ah]
ya usually that time is the hottest [ah]
ya
[oh] [oh] okay
convenient [lah] (mm)
okay okay so I now I have a plan already so I can start to fill up the form
okay and then the charges <malay>untuk</malay> (err) this registration <malay>ada tak</malay>
[oh]
okay okay
<malay>tapi</malay> the marriage prep course <malay>tak payah</malay> [kan]

okay (mm)
okay so so <malay>sebelum</malay> interview <malay>dengan kadi</malay> is you <malay>jumpa</malay> the head of the first

!huh! <malay>ye ke</malay> [oh] okay
all the time I heard is compulsory
until recently
ya
<malay>harus</malay> [ah]
okay
yes
<malay>betul juga</malay> !wah! <malay>tapi masa tu tak ada</malay> wedding cake
[oh] okay okay okay
I also want to reduce also
[ah] ya [lah]
<malay>pasal dia</malay> single single layer [kan]
<malay>pun tak dapat rasa</malay>
okay I see
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>ye</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi yang</malay> cake <malay>ni</malay> is is actually not a muslim right is west western culture ya okay
okay
<malay>sekarang</malay> nowadays they offer <malay>macam</malay> hotel one they offer dummy cake just to for the photo taking
(mm) okay

(mm) (mm) nowadays got <malay>pak andam</malay>
(mm) <malay>pasal nak ikat dia punya bunga</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi sekali</malay> [jer] [kan] maybe before the <malay>dia nikah</malay> [jer] [kan]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya
<malay>tapi mak andam sampai</malay> the whole day [mah]
so no no point right
okay okay
okay
ya
okay
ya okay
<malay>sama</malay> [lah]
bread and butter right
okay
(mm) okay
okay
okay
okay okay
okay
okay
!huh!
okay
okay
okay okay
(mm) okay [lah] angry [lah]
okay
<malay>cuma cuma dia punya masa tu</malay> thinking is <malay>dia nak pergi sana cepat</malay> so <malay>dia ada</malay> time to makeup [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) okay [oh] okay okay
for bride [lah] ya you <malay>dah</malay> plan [pe]
ya okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tu tak boleh jadi</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh</malay> [seh]
!huh! [oh]
<malay>kirakan sekarang ni macam</malay> they are <malay>macam</malay> (err) they messed up the (err) planning
some some some <malay>mak andam</malay> because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning [lah] okay
okay
okay <malay>dia</malay> panic [lah] okay
okay
<malay>kirakan</malay> flexible [lah] okay okay (uh huh)
(mm) <malay>jadi kirakan kalau macam</malay> if we do <malay>nikah</malay> and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
[oh] <malay>kirakan bukan pasal</malay> delay <malay>pasal</malay> they earn more [lah] no [lah] we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
<malay>tapi</malay> [oh] but you know how their charges are is like per whole [oh] not [oh]
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion [ah] ya
okay
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> #prata# okay
a bit greasy [ah]
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
[oh] most of your friend also do at fort canning [ah]
okay
I see
okay <malay>jadi mak andam</malay> is not requirement unless you have (err) several outfit change
[oh] okay okay <malay>jadi sama</malay> [lah] I think for my side I think I don't want to have <malay>mak andam</malay> I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have (err) ya
(mm) but but she have no experience
true also
okay
okay
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah] cause you want what you want [lah] okay
okay
I I even thought of what you know because <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>katong sana</malay> [kan] there are many (err) salon ya then we thought (err) go there early ya
but that will be strange
(mm)
ya cause very close [eh] because <malay>yang</malay> grand mercure <malay>ada banyak</malay> salon ya how good [ah] that's why I have to go there okay
peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early
ya <malay>dia pun</malay> I email <malay>juga</malay> (mm)
(mm)
okay so that part
ya I have to ask #dewi# to do research [lah] then from there
most likely we also will do the same thing [lah] <malay>kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi</malay> [ah] the day <malay>macam</malay> one off <malay>saja</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay <malay>mak andam</malay> is for rental cause they got special rate
ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> of course photography on the same day is the best [lah] cheapest [ah] cheapest [lah] because you do makeup all that
[oh] okay so we do the <malay>nikah</malay> and the photography after that
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
<malay>paling senang dekat dalam</malay> hotel <malay>tu tak boleh gerak-gerak</malay>
(mm) okay
ya
(mm) ya <malay>dia nya</malay> swimming pool I ever went it looks nice [lah] so I think I need to ask the person on that day
whether to see okay
(mm) we can go up and see [ah]
(mm)
<malay>bila</malay>
really [ah] you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel [oh] we thought of booking hotel for you all so
!huh! is
okay
lucky you tell me [eh] cause we really thought of booking for you all also then dinner we can go eat ya okay
okay ya okay ya let us know [lah] because we thought of (err) booking [lah] ya
okay
okay then ya so
three three (err) I think for for your case [kan] <malay>tiga jam macam</malay> okay [ah] very manageable
ya it's is very fast I like that
<malay>apa yang</malay> teething problems
I I know one problem that you all face is the
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem <malay>aku</malay> outside [mah] but I can see people no space sit ya
(mm)
!huh! [oh] they stay back [oh]
(mm)
<malay>pasal panas</malay> [oh] ya [lah] <malay>hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat</malay> (err) lawn <malay>tu</malay> mostly <malay>budak-budak</malay> parents <malay>semua tak pergi</malay> [seh] [ah]
yes yes I saw I saw it's quite (um)
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the <malay>nikah</malay>
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
for for my case okay [lah] <malay>terus</malay> settle
(um) but it's during the (err) the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in [ah] how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
cause for for (err) the place I have right there's a stage <malay>jadi kalau kirakan</malay> okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> start at eleven thirty
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau apa tu</malay> like what you said
<malay>betul juga tapi</malay> wedding <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang macam</malay> panic [kan] <malay>jadi ada sikit</malay> problem <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma apa tu</malay>
(err)
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my <malay>nikah</malay> so
<malay>nikah</malay> plus (err) tea ceremony ya
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
ya [lah] <malay>siapa nak ikut</malay> to the letter [kan] yes
she don't care
yes
okay cause I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
<malay>kirakan</malay> I want to like <malay>macam</malay> eleven thirty to one for example is <malay>nikah</malay> tea ceremony and then
that's also the time <malay>kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar</malay> [lah]
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
okay <malay>tapi kalau</malay> COVID <malay>dia ada</malay> different kind of rules [ah] only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
(err) out of that twenty they have to be in their table [oh] but <malay>mungkin</malay> maybe <malay>masa tu</malay> policy <malay>belum</malay> start [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I went to the Grand Mercure right and (err)
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
<malay>tapi tapi kalau ada apa-apa nanti kena</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> COVID infection [ah]
okay
hopefully [lah] okay
okay I see but only worry like (err) <malay>yang</malay> table <malay>yang tak</malay> mingle boring [ah] <malay>duduk tengok</malay> each other <malay>makan</malay> cannot mix with the you know
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what [ah] ya
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> your wedding <malay>lain</malay> [tau] your wedding can mingle is a is different cause (err) your time can be taken [ah] you know speaking [ah]
<malay>kena</malay>
simple simple (hmm) okay <malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
really [ah] actually I don't want to but because I don't want to make it boring for them and I want to have like unified (err) unified
okay
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> if I
(hmm) okay okay [oh] I <malay>itu yang</malay> category <malay>macam</malay> (err) emcee [ah] <malay>yang macam</malay> too much [lah] that's why
ya I want the like (err) formal one simple one
true also
I see
I <malay>kena fikir juga pasal ni</malay>
that is one thing then ya <malay>baju</malay> you all buy the fabric then make at the #joo chiat# right

sorry [ah] why why what happened
okay which man U game was that (mm)
[oh] I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
<malay>macam main bawah blok</malay> [sia] <malay>tu</malay> bro
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david #moyes# you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when #thiago# was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
[eh] anyway <malay>sekarang</malay> david #moyes# <malay>kat mana</malay> [siol]
[ah]
[oh] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> manage west ham [oh] west ham [eh] [ah] how did west ham do in their [oh] they lost against new castle
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games [ah]
am I right okay never mind (err) who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch [tau] it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw #thiago# go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
and you know we we've got these we've got these <malay>dia macam kau macam</malay> you just look at this guy
and you're like okay <malay>dah</malay> settle settle settle you know you know you know he's got the swagger you know he's a bawler you know like damn this guy goes in and that's it man the game is over
(mm)
okay
(uh huh)
that philosophy [ah]
okay
the same louis #van gaal# were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
(mmhmm)
okay
ya
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
so that's why #mourinho# <malay>selalunya dia nya</malay> team (err) their possession their possession stats are usually quite low right okay
I see
okay
!wow!
so he's like the empty football guy
(uh huh)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay that's that's the same school [ah]
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
just whack [ah] basically [ah]
[a'ah]
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
#klopp# and #mourinho# <malay>ni macam dorang macam</malay> opposite sides of the spectrum [ah] in a way [ah]
#klopp# denies you space #mourinho# #mourinho# gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with [ah] but [ah] okay [lah] I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean !wow! wonderful game from a
<malay>apa</malay> swan [eh] swan swan and harry kane

how do you how do you play it on Android on your phone <malay>aku</malay>
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years [ah] actually I can play on my iPad also [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] anyway [ah] I don't want to get myself involved in another addictive thing [ah] cause you know I've just (uh)
I've I've recently gotten addicted to a few things on Netflix already and on Apple so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
(err) I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically (err) [ah] I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
(err) so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated (err) Netflix show
I I like what Netflix does these days [eh] <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> ranking for the programme stuff so like if you are watching from singapore they will tell you like what are the good shows it's not what are the good shows that are singaporean me in like a moulmein high for instance
okay but anyway (err)
[sial] [lah] bro that [one] <malay>macam</malay> for life for life for life I will be like when I watch moulmein high right I will be like
<malay>kau</malay> #zuleika# #zulkifli# actually likes this bloody show this poor excuse on my television program
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix [lah] cause
what happened was (uh) when september now [eh] so last month (err)
early august after I came back from that camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
(err) I was like okay [lah] feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
!hey! there's this #anelka# documentary on Netflix
[ah] have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this #anelka# documentary [ah] so so it's (uh) it's a
tell all documentary [ah] an #anelka# and his life you know like you know how he converted to islam you know and then what he's currently doing you know the the clubs that he has played at everything <malay>macam</malay> basically
<malay>aku rasa nama dia macam gitu</malay> [ah] I mean he's muslim name is supposedly #bilal# but okay anyway I mean it doesn't focus too much on the religion on his religion but more on like the funny
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
like one was the the france <malay>punya</malay>
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause (err)
raymond dominic actually like (uh) had a an argument with #anelka#
and <malay>macam pada</malay> #anelka# it was not fair [ah] like for him to be made ya for him to be singled out so okay so anyway
I got into Netflix cause of that #anelka# documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows [lah] but some like (err) okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai [ah]
okay so so so basically <malay>macam</malay> I've watched cobra kai I've watched (err) I mean I don't tend to watch the series [ah] I would watch like documentaries or <malay>macam</malay> movies [ah] so like social dilemma was another thing I watched recently which was pretty interesting [ah]
(err) social dilemma is basically this documentary that I mean everybody's talking about this documentary now (uh) it's about how <malay>macam</malay> Facebook Instagram all these all these you know the social media giants [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> basically
<malay>dorang tahu</malay> like what attracts you what what you're interested in (uh)
so <malay>dorang buat macam</malay> (uh) and if not an avatar they like what do you call it [lah]
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like [oh] they sell the data
to all these third party you know it's it's not that it's more like <malay>macam</malay> they they use your data to know what hooks you and that's why <malay>macam</malay> Facebook becomes like you know it becomes personalise it becomes something that you are addicted to
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation [ah]
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
[sia] [ah] why do they think this way [sia] <malay>asal dorang fikir macam gitu</malay> like <malay>dia</malay>
like like ya no cause cause your the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the is bad for the country
(uh) am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
<malay>kau</malay> how can people just support [sia] <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> but actually the problem is the people who are supporting they are being fed information that fits their worldview you see okay so so it's a very like ya [lah] usually it's either very insidious thingy [ah]
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like [oh] you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting [lah] like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it [lah] so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and (err) it's about how this guy (err) I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder (err) ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you [lah] but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town [lah] that he's in
[ah] it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean [ah] okay [lah] so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places [ah] one is (err) knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america (uh)
(err) K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so [ah] basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
so he seen all like atrocities of war so he's kind of like <malay>macam</malay> lost his faith a bit [lah] cause one of the themes of the movie
is (err) you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that [lah]
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so (uh) and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then (err) and then and then and then
after he has a son of his own he starts to <malay>macam</malay> go back to
like worshipping god [ah] no <malay>macam macam</malay> it's like it's like suddenly he
feels drawn you know it's like <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>orang beragama pun macam</malay>
<malay>kau ada kau punya turun naik gitu</malay> that sort of thing so <malay>macam mungkin dia tak sembahyang</malay> for like five years <malay>lepas tu dia macam</malay> [eh] #astgahfirullah# <malay>aku kena qadak balik solat aku</malay>
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
ya so so so that's a tragedy <malay>macam</malay> something happens and then after that he he has this <malay>macam</malay> love hate relationship with god and then his son who's growing up is looking at this you know and observing it and then the son also grows up
to have that kind of like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story (err)
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted [ah] I mean in the movie they they they
[ah] not not just inner demons [ah] I mean they are just they are evil people [ah] you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is [ah] robert pattison
you know that twilight fella [lah] !huh! ya the glittery vampire so <malay>dia yang sekarang</malay>
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something [kan]
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but [eh] but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show [ah]
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie [ah]
[ah] well he doesn't he doesn't molest children [ah]
okay shouldn't stereotype (err) pastor <malay>dorang</malay>
[a'ah]
okay
are you sure you want to say this on (err) are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box [ah]
okay [lah] so it's an [lah] it's not the Android box <malay>yang</malay> Android box <malay>yang sikit hari aku pergi rumah kau kau ada</malay> [kan] <malay>tu benda</malay> [kan]
[oh] is it
so basically it's an [lah]
okay okay
[ah]
[oh] is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya [lah] they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five [ah] it's like not not even [ah]
ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl [kan]
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
(mm)
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that (uh) they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no [lah]
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's (uh) not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
(err) groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans [lah]
no he was in house of cards and and (err) house of cards the final season just <malay>macam tergantung macam gitu apa</malay>
because of this [ah] so
so I mean like in singapore #dee kosh# obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
ya so so so basically I think this is what's happening <malay>mungkin sekarang dunia sekarang</malay> cause of all the
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
religious upbringing to say like [eh] <malay>ni benda salah</malay> [sia] what am I doing you know that sort of thing so <malay>macam</malay> I mean that's probably why you see all these peeping toms in
no [lah] no no no no no I mean there that if there was it would have been a big thing and it would have been like <malay>macam</malay> it won't have been like once every few months [ah] which is the situation you find it you find now [ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
alright
[oh] my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through [ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
he's he's a good kid [ah]
okay
[a'ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
okay
<malay>dia panggil kau</malay> sir but <malay>asal dia masuk lagi siang dari kau</malay> [seh]
[oh] okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him [oh] you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya [lah] cause you went to was it sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that #upskirtism#
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
so he actually did it
look [eh] look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates [ah] bro
check it out I I was wrong okay [lah] I mean I think I can tell this to the camera [eh] to the camera <malay>pula</malay> to the recorder okay I was from #serangoon# right
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name [ah] but but but I don't know but
ya I mean when he when it came out in the news the first thing we did was to share in the WhatsApp group and then we were like asking like <malay>ini</malay> #aizat# #adam# <malay>ni semua</malay> like [eh] ya [eh] [eh] you guys remember this guy ya ya ya he's from our school <malay>dulu</malay>
I don't think you will he's a he's just a random chinese dude [lah] but but <malay>macam</malay>
and he was in a class where he was in a class where cause there were there were not that many (uh) malays in so like there were some classes which were purely chinese [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you won't find a malay chap in the in that class [ah]
so basically he was in one of those classes [ah]
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him [lah] like I I remember of
his existence back this in [ah]
yes
I'm I'm sure I'm sure the article is still somewhere on the straits times <malay>nanti aku</malay> google <malay>aku</malay> check [kan] <malay>lepas tu aku aku aku</malay> forward <malay>dekat kau</malay> [lah]
so you know you can you can you can know about the monsters that (uh) inhibits our society [ah] but basically ya [lah] back to what we were saying <malay>macam aku rasa</malay> that's where you know we are I mean just looking at our generation and comparing it to our parents generation you cannot really see
there's a lot of difference <malay>apa betul tak</malay> like
ya <malay>macam</malay> one thing about us <malay>mungkin</malay> (err) compared to <malay>kita punya</malay> parents [eh] <malay>macam kita kahwin lagi lambat abeh kita</malay> tend to <malay>macam mungkin ada lebih mata air dari mak bapa kita</malay> you know like our parents <malay>aku rasa dorangnya</malay> generations is like <malay>kau kenal ni satu perempuan</malay>
within a few months <malay>tunang</malay> another few months <malay>kahwin</malay> you know that sort of thing
ya
what was that so so so you see [eh] <malay>macam</malay> what #ondre# said is like that was our parents I mean our grandparents is completely different [ah] you know like my mum my grandmother like thirteen fourteen years old she was like married off to the husband without even knowing who her husband was
but ya I mean that was that was the case [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like [oh] it was a norm [ah] like [oh] your father will just marry you off you know when the time is right ya exactly so so like
like if you are a man of twenty one twenty two back there then you are okay <malay>kau dah kerja kau dah ada hasil sikit</malay> or maybe you're an immigrant like my grandmother they got married to both my grandmothers got married to pakistani migrants [ah] you know so <malay>macam</malay> like
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally [lah] cause he's from that country
<malay>orang</malay> pakistan <malay>kat sini</malay> will be like
okay you you you you you know you you you form part of our group now [ah] so maybe <malay>kat masjid ke jumpa dekat kedai kopi ke apa</malay> then talk talk talk [eh] I got a daughter you know
that sort of thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it was it was that sort of environment where the girl doesn't even have a say as to who she's married to [ah] but of course I mean
maybe I don't know [ah] maybe we're we're looking at it differently [lah] maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation [ah] from what I understand [lah]
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum [ah]
I think I think for you also that time you mentioned that <malay>macam</malay> (err) #syed ahmad# was interested in your mother
sorry #syed ahmad# we didn't mean to mention your name
[oh] okay
[oh] okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
[ah] we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
(um) okay so what was that okay so basically <malay>macam</malay> ya that's if you see that from one generation to the next definitely that relationship between men and women is changing [ah] so <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku pun ada fikir</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>anak aku</malay>
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
okay
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
okay
ya
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya
I think girls these days they are like <malay>lagi beza dari kita macam</malay> in the sense that they are really pressured to
look and ya look and behave a certain way [ah] perhaps [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
well I mean what can you say [ah] these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on [ah]
and I guess people are just
following trends [ah] just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
susceptible to this [ah] <malay>macam kita semua pun ada macam ikut-ikut orang apa</malay> in a way [lah] but <malay>aku rasa untuk wanita ni</malay>
<malay>dorang lebih senang dipengaruh</malay> [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> [ah] [ah] like compared to guys [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I mean like you mean like when I got married also I realised my wife <malay>macam</malay>
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
[ah] <malay>kau nak kahwin dekat masjid kau tak ada nak ada walimah</malay> you know that sort of thinking you know
but now is like quite common [ah] you know nowadays you have mosque
where they provide a place for you to do the <malay>walimah</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] but you still had your your function in a activity hall [ah] my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
a still somewhat rare for the whole <malay>majlis</malay> from front to end to be held in the mosque but of course nowadays you have places like <malay>masjid mawaddah</malay>
(err) I mean there there are some !huh!
no but bartley is like <malay>macam</malay> bartley is is is so called not really
(err) subject to any of these trends I feel [lah]
you can [lah] you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
I'm trying to say is that <malay>macam</malay> nowadays you have instances where people do say like [eh] should we have our <malay>majlis</malay> in a mosque cause then like <malay>orang nak sembahyang</malay> and all that it's easy for them that sort of thing and then ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's a it's a nice place to you for you to have your wedding [what] you know in a way [lah] but of course
<malay>pada aku pun aku rasa macam</malay> if I could have done it again maybe I would have done a <malay>walimah</malay> a small <malay>walimah</malay> outside the mosque [ah]
ya
okay [ah] not not exactly where I wanted the conversation to go but then you okay so so <malay>macam macam pada aku macam bini aku macam</malay> that was
something that that was on her mind like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] why are we doing it in the mosque <malay>abeh macam</malay> like [oh] I want to invite only these few people and of course now because of COVID you are forced
to have a small wedding like you can't have a big wedding but but I mean but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> like and same like when I wanted to buy my house which was a three room flat people were like
[eh] why you buying a three room flat [sia] it's so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> I think I've I've put my wife under a lot of pressure [ah] I've I've I've subjected to a lot of like questioning [ah]
[ah]
you know landed correct correct but I think in a way <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day you just have to be
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that [ah] you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house [lah] I don't know whether I told you
ya !huh! ya ya <malay>aku dah</malay> end of this month [eh] end of this month [eh] end of this year <malay>dah enam tahun</malay>
<malay>aku fikir aku nak</malay> upgrade to <malay>macam</malay> five room <malay>ke</malay> [ah]
#sengkang# <malay>juga</malay>
bro bro #tampines# <malay>mahal</malay> bro #tampines# <malay>mahal gila</malay> no no no I'm I'm going to stay near my parents
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> #abbas# <malay>nya</malay> parents <malay>aku</malay> #sengkang# <malay>apa</malay>
bro #sengkang# bro #raeesah khan#
[oh] sorry was that too loud jamus #lim#
(err) unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not #sengkang# but it's okay
no no this is #ang mo kio# so
basically basically okay basically basically #sengkang# right it's divided into a rivervale compassvale anchorvale and fernvale [lah] so for those people who don't know #sengkang# you know is divided into this so called <malay>macam</malay> four districts <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] so (err) anchorvale and fernvale is separated by this <malay>sungai</malay> [lah]
it's called the <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# I think [ah] so like if you look out my window here you can see the <malay>sungai</malay> [ah]
so that <malay>sungai</malay> #punggol# (err) is the boundary between #sengkang# which is held by the workers' party and #ang mo kio# which is held by pinky work
[ah] sorry [ah] every conversation between #zulika# and myself must involve some degree of politics [lah] then you know there's some spice [ah]
so (uh) we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come (uh) we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good [ah] [ah]
I I don't want to play games [ah] I mean I think I would draw the line at games [ah]
ya
my wife my wife and I [oh] but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife [ah] okay
[a'ah]
okay
!wah!
that's a very productive (err) your time bro
[oh] okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad [eh] you you should talk
you should talk to my cousin #abbas# [ah] who lives down the street cause he was the one who told me [eh] <malay>kalau kau suka</malay> breaking bad <malay>kau kena</malay> watch this better call saul [lah]
so <malay>aku macam aku ada tengok</malay> [ah] like like a
I think I watch like season one season two I mean there were parts where it was already addictive but after a while <malay>aku macam</malay> how many seasons are there [oh] my god breaking bad only has five seasons
[oh] my god okay
ya [lah] he hasn't changed his name yet [lah]
okay
yes yes yes yes
(uh)
okay
[ah]
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see [oh] ya ya ya ya ya
no I I I think I think I watched up to that point where <malay>abang dia yang</malay> very afraid of electricity or some shit like that right
(err) so I think his brother died or something [eh]
okay I I think roughly around at that point <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them [ah] okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
[kan] there was one point where the brother suddenly like he he he I for some reason it was like a miracle <malay>dia macam terus</malay> didn't have that
a psychological thingy so he just ended up like going into the office and I think he didn't want the ya [lah] but he kept on <malay>macam</malay> like downplaying <malay>si</malay> jimmy <malay>nya</malay> achievement [ah] <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> you'll never amount to anything that sort of thing [kan]
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago [sia]
okay
!huh!
I I've never watch game of thrones [ah] by the way
and the witcher <malay>ke apa</malay> witcher witcher <malay>pun aku tak tengok sangat</malay>
of course [ah] bro ya
there was a prison break movie
[eh] prison break <malay>si dia tu dah mati</malay> [kan] the actual <malay>dah mati</malay> [kan] the guy who plays michael scofield [lah]
yes he died right
okay let me google this michael scofield <malay>mati</malay>
wentworth miller
[oh] okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me [ah] no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true [ah]
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it [oh] ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
so is season five good or not <malay>dorang ada tulis</malay> prison break season six <malay>lagi tak</malay> [ah]
[oh] my god I I thought this was over [sia] bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
the movie was not on the <malay>ni ni</malay> [kan] the movie was on <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] only the final break
shucks [ah] #ikram# stop getting me hooked back on all this crap [lah] <malay>malas</malay> [sial] <malay>nak pergi tengok ni semua</malay>
[ah]
[oh] my god stop [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[a'ah]
[sial] [lah] bro you could have read all the books [seh] in all that time [sia] bro
[oh] I heard of that but I didn't watch it
<malay>aku bilang kau aku aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> once I see <malay>macam satu benda ni ada</malay> four five seasons [kan]
<malay>aku terus lemah</malay> [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> no [lah] I cannot watch this [sia]
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that (err) I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently [lah] so this is iphone
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so is a you know it's it's one of the new boys [lah] so apparently you know now if you install fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay [ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
!hey! siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
the the code will come out I just scan and cause I'm using the singpass <malay>punya</malay> app
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
[ah] all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful [lah] I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
mine is after iPhone eight [lah] basically <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] so so so it's one of those things that I don't know [ah] Apple fan boys are talking about these days [ah]
double double tap then the code <malay>keluar</malay>
the scanner the scanner the scanner <malay>keluar</malay> not the code the camera thingy ya
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a code
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
it automatically scans the code [oh] okay
double tap then the no you don't need to press anything double tap and then your that that square will come out and you just aim it at the code [ah] <malay>macam ni kau tengok</malay> <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
no no no that's that's if you can [lah] <malay>kat bawah tu</malay> [kan]
then it goes <malay>ayatul kursi</malay>
there <malay>kat bawah kat bawah sini</malay>
it goes in a anti clockwise [eh] clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
can you see or not it's like when you follow you follow this <malay>dia macam</malay> go
like that
so (uh) #inshallah# with [ah] I also reciting <malay>ayatul kursi</malay> we will get our twenty dollars and (err) we can spend it on a steak later at #jalan kayu#
[eh] so so so (err) we're coming to the end
shall we talk about our favourite <malay>makan</malay> places since it's almost lunch
<malay>tempat makan aku tahu ada tempat makan sana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I've never heard of it being described as a good place [lah]
okay
babe <malay>aku pun aku pun</malay> I know I know (err) anchorvale
<malay>dorang ada</malay> the vending machine cafe [ah] if that's what you are referring to
[oh] I think I know what your day is referring to
the <malay>yassin kampung kau pernah dengar yassin kampung</malay>
yes so <malay>yassin kampung</malay> they have this off shoot called <malay>lepak</malay> one corner
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
the worst name you can have for this particular place cause it's the place where you cannot <malay>lepak</malay> one corner it it doesn't feel like the <malay>lepak</malay> place [ah] it feels like you just go in <malay>kau beli makan dekat</malay> no the thing is what know you can't even sit down to get the waiter to come and serve you you have to
[ah] both [ah]
okay ya good joke but [ah] so then <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia macam tempat makan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> okay <malay>kau kena masuk abeh kau kena macam</malay> queue up <malay>dekat</malay> the stall [ah] so it's like a hawker stall [ah] it's like a hawker centre
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
hawker centre you don't sit down and the fella comes to you right you got to go to the stall and order like <malay>abeh kau kena pergi sana</malay> order then after that you got to get ready your cash cause you got to put it into that stupid machine obviously these days nobody wants to touch cash so you put it into the machine they will dispense your change
then after that <malay>makanan dia</malay> okay [lah] not bad [lah] but <malay>pada aku macam</malay> so so <malay>juga</malay> but it doesn't have the <malay>lepak</malay> feeling [lah]
because like <malay>pada aku lepak</malay> feeling <malay>macam kau kau duduk</malay> then like [eh] #bhai# <malay>teh tarik lagi satu</malay> [ah] [eh] if you want to go place you should go to #mahamoodiya#
but I mean it's a bit late for for #prata# #simpang bedok# [ah]
you don't know #mahamoodiya#
yes the one next to the Shell [eh] <malay>dorang dah</malay> up market [sia]

I was looking through our the booking right
then <malay>aku</malay> realise
<malay>mahal</malay> [sia] it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the <malay>apa</malay> last week of the year [what]
[kan] then <malay>aku tak tahu macam mana</malay> like we need to have more options I guess
ya okay
but unless we go for the <malay>apa</malay> [ah] smaller rooms [ah]
because the one that I found was
that one <malay>untuk yang</malay> the suite room so <malay>aku rasa macam besar sangat</malay> I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
the same place because
okay (err)
<malay>aku rasa boleh</malay> [ah] but I think it's about <malay>dalam empat ratus gitu</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah]
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus [ah] below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think <malay>aku rasa</malay> for now <malay>empat orang</malay> but
ya I think only four [lah] right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so (err)

there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least <malay>macam tujuh puluh</malay> percent <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> go to phase three [lah] so
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that [lah] they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members [lah] <malay>yang tinggal dalam serumah</malay> right
ya
different timing
ya
can
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas <malay>punya</malay> dinner [kan]
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely [lah] I mean you cannot meet [lah] but
so <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> like
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
[oh] ya just five of us [lah]
without partners [lor]
(mm)
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us [what]
korean ya that [ah]
#farin# birthday
[oh]
[oh] yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners [lor] that
#bo# #pian# [lah] [kan] <malay>macam tak boleh apa</malay>
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
I mean technically it's not even a <malay>macam</malay> public holiday on that day right
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya okay
I think he never go there before so you should be safe <malay>dia tak ada</malay> benchmark <malay>untuk tempat tu</malay>
ya
(um)
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work [lah]
then the next morning he will <malay>aku rasa</malay> go to the work straight
ya
(mm)
ya [lor]
so the tuesday morning <malay>aku rasa</malay> he has to go back to work [lor]
monday right
is it really
ya
[oh]
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
!hais!
okay [lor] we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday <malay>punya</malay> time slot I mean (err) rates ya
then he say it's like seven hundred [oh] my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred [sia]
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> taiwan
you are in a cold room
!whoa! but luckily I went taiwan [sia] just before lockdown
ya
(err) not as good as that one we we went that time
ya it was that one I go on march it was <malay>macam sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> just like aircon kind yes
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
!hais!
!hais! ya
ya
[eh] but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
(um) ya
but you know the that time the who say [ah] which minister
the he say <malay>macam apa</malay> like
he's not going they are not going to <malay>macam</malay> vaccinate everybody <malay>kat</malay> singapore
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> save <malay>duit agaknya</malay>
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably [lah] elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations [lah] wait those are compulsory right
ya maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel [lah]
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
was there [lah] [oh] my god
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> purpose [kan] I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so <malay>kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat</malay> they can just spread to each other [lah]
(err) they have another issue to tackle there [oh] my god
(mm)
are you talking about succulent
[oh] cactus cactus <malay>yang kecil-kecil gitu</malay> [eh] then
[oh]
<malay>dua</malay> cactus
the normal one cactus
no the normal cactus <malay>yang besar dia ada</malay> thorns then <malay>macam bulat-bulat gitu</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay> shape
straight then <malay>bulat-bulat</malay> [eh] right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
<malay>kau siak</malay> [ah] !hey! <malay>mahal pokok tu</malay>
(mm)
[oh] I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what [sia] cardboard
[oh] what
<malay>kau tanam pokok</malay> durian [jer] [lah]
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
!hais! anyway I have an assignment on an essay [lah] so I need just (err) your your point of view [lah] I guess
(mm) it's about (um)
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
the experts say [lah] the lockdown causes more <malay>macam apa</malay> problems than benefits ya
why
(mm)
ya
true [leh] ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
(mm)
ya
(mm)
good [what] lockdown good [what] I was enjoying the period
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems [lah] rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
[oh]
ya
(mm)
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel [lah] like always been pushing
all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation [lah] so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway (err)
<malay>macam dulu dia tak pakai</malay> grab but <malay>sekali</malay> now [oh] I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it [lah] rather than <malay>kau tahu macam kalau tak ada</malay> COVID like everybody is still
<malay>macam</malay> oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during also got famous because of this so
okay [lah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya [lah] #alhamdulillah# I need the money so what's the problem
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money <malay>untuk</malay>
to avoid this (err) to convert their platform store into online platform [lah] so
<malay>aku rasa</malay> okay [lah]
(mm)
true I mean you will lose your human touches also [lah] right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of now like because of a lockdown so I think
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa</malay> what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>semua buat</malay> #dalgona# coffee <malay>macam kau</malay>
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
(err)
I think it brings families together
kind
<malay>macam</malay>
you will just stuck at home with your family [lah] you got no choice but just to interact <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> like
that's all [lah] like
so
ya
I know
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like <malay>kalau kau baca</malay> that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
not every family can get along [lah] hundred percent get along so
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one !wah! then
ya
right ya
(mm)
ya obviously
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better [lah] because you know carbon footprints were reduced [lah] I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit [lah] of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight [lah] like just
ya
ya
ya
okay [lah] at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress [lah] I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit [leh]
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
(mm)
ya
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> like I think they <malay>dia orang tak</malay> concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
maybe they did [lah] like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
I mean during the even like <malay>dia punya apa</malay>
not counsellors [lah] what what is it calling
<malay>orang yang</malay>
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
so they don't really care about that part <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but
ya
(mm)
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes [lah] but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya [eh] can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society [lah] I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case [lah] on the rise during
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water [one]
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito [one]
it's true okay [lah] but that's not really a problem I guess
it just go without the track [what] [sia] <malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down [lah]
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel [lah] at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] confirm <malay>ada</malay> [lah]
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot [leh]
is it
aren't we not at the top
[oh] we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest [lah]
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then <malay>macam</malay> suddenly <malay>kau dalam hutan tu kau</malay> introduce <malay>monyet kau</malay> introduce pangolin <malay>kau</malay> introduce lemur <malay>pelanduk</malay> I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
<malay>pergi mana balik rumah kau</malay>
ya <malay>ni bukan</malay> library [tau] <malay>kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil</malay> [tau]
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to [lah] but it's not possible [lah] per se
[oh] my god
[oh] that one that they kill all the animal [ah] but cause the one all is affected infected with the coronavirus [what] ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
so they have to kill or <malay>macam</malay> that one [lah] like what chicken flu like that [eh] bird flu chicken flu
they have to kill all the the chickens [mah]
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
<malay>sekali</malay> coronavirus from plants [leh]
yes
<malay>apa apa merepek kau</malay>
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya inside the middle [ah]
(uh huh)
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese (err) [ah] swiss cheese plant
stop it [lah]
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times [leh]
what is a prayer plant
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but monstera is an indoor plant [what] right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
(mm)
ya
ya
technically they are bushes [lah] weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
not really [leh]
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt [leh]
<malay>kau masih</malay> [tau]
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer [lah] but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
(err) the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk [leh] like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also [what] light can [ah]
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
<malay>dah mati ke</malay>
can [ah]
ya probably can [lah] I don't know
I don't know it just grows short [lah] from small to big [lah] I guess shoots ya
!hais!
I only need to buy one plant <malay>untuk taruh dalam</malay> office <malay>aku</malay>
no [oh] my god that one
<malay>mati kesian benda tu</malay>
but actually <malay>mati</malay> a very terrible death to do
ya [sia] <malay>kau teruk</malay> [sia]
then we got scraping <malay>benda tu</malay>
no [meh]
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
[ah]
(mm)
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office (uh) condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
!aiya! the typical <malay>kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> coconut tree but it's not
what is it called [eh] <malay>yang</malay>
it's not coconut tree <malay>yang pokok-pokok yang</malay>
fern <malay>gitu</malay> is it look like a fern
!aiya! very the
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] serious
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
ya usually events that kind of <malay>pokok</malay> [lah] you know like those
standard <malay>pokok</malay> I don't know
it's the typical <malay>pokok</malay> at events you know
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
(mm) [oh] my god
(mm)
yes that's one thing <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
!hais!
(mm)
spray is it then
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
(mm)
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also [what] if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
(mm)
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
(mm) ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die [sia]
(hmm)
[oh] my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough [lah] too much plants [ah] mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant [eh]

it started out fine but it's like (err) when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
when we went to the camps when we tried to come back to the campsite [lah] so basically after the (uh) night the first mission night walk right then they had a briefing then <malay>tepuk</malay> [ah] something like that we walked back to the campsite that I somehow tripped tripped but I didn't really trip because it was
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
but the what weird like <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>benda yang pelik yang terjadi</malay> [kan] actually <malay>selepas tu</malay>
like so basically [kan] like okay so I was injured so I I fell so I I sprained my ankle [kan] so <malay>yang dia punya</malay> faci <malay>dia</malay> [kan] the [eh] no a teacher wanted to take a shorter cut [lah] because I was injured right so they (uh) they brought three of us took the shorter cut by the time we <malay>sampai dia punya</malay> campsite [kan]

like beside that's why when the moment you said [oh] <malay>kat</malay> #bugis# right then I was like is it near the near the <malay>madrasah</malay> and when you said yes I know about this story it's quite famous [lah] I mean who would think

okay [lah] okay it was fine it was fine it was because you know you <malay>pergi surau</malay> you won't go alone [what] especially because I <malay>budak</malay> singapore [kan] <malay>mana orang nak bagi anak pergi sana</malay> especially because malaysia you know [ah] there's a lot of those cases right so
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>bukan culik</malay> [jer] <malay>habis</malay>
so it's like I mean <malay>seram</malay> is <malay>seram</malay> but <malay>yang paling seram</malay> is one of my uncle's house <malay>dekat ni jalan</malay> #tan kee# it's <malay>kat</malay> [eh] but I think they move [ah] already it was damn dilapidated

ya but I mean I shower because it was with my mum but imagine if I was I was alone I will not shower I don't know how my sister went to shower alone [oh] my god <malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>masa tu tengah ada</malay> case <malay>apa tu</malay> you know they <malay>masa</malay> that [one] is early two thousand still got case of <malay>apa tu orang minyak ke apa</malay> [kan] something like that
no they say that
<malay>pengamal pengamal</malay> they they they practise like magic no they <malay>amal</malay> it like
you you know how some you know how some people <malay>buang dia orang punya</malay> pad <malay>darah dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang nak lawa</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang nanti ambil dia orang baca-baca dia orang ambil dia orang punya darah uzur tu dia orang taruk kat muka dia orang baca-baca</malay> that's how [lah] <malay>dia orang amal</malay> [lah] <malay>macam orang</malay> ya because like you know how they <malay>simpan jin simpannya hantu raya simpannya simpannya cik kak</malay> [kan] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>balik kampung</malay> no
no I don't know I don't know [eh] I think I don't know [eh] is it I also don't know but I I still don't know the difference I only recently found out all the difference between <malay>langsuir</malay> and <malay>pontianak</malay>
LOL
[oh] <malay>yang nenek tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>bomoh</malay> [eh]
is it the <malay>makcik bomoh</malay> that [one] that episode
(uh huh) cause I watched that [one]
ya the one that the guy <malay>potong kuku malam-malam</malay> then the guy the other guy <malay>bukanya payung dalam rumah</malay> [kan] ya ya why what's your question
<malay>apa apa</malay> no <malay>penanggal penanggal lain</malay> do you realise it's the same thing because #nananggal# is the philippines term for <malay>penanggal penanggal</malay> is <malay>melayu</malay>
you will realise that okay you realise that a lot of the folklore right it's similar because we live in the same region you know if you check our genealogy [kan] philippines indonesia <malay>melayu orang orang</malay> singapore yes correct we are all basically the same ethnicities just that because of the you know the like they they split up and things like that !aiya! anyways but ya it's actually the same folklore [lah]
that's why you said lady in white right for us it's <malay>pontianak</malay> you were saying
(mmhmm)
<malay>cerita apa ni</malay>
[oh] one of the one of the [oh] it wasn't in the it wasn't in the [oh] ya ya ya ya ya the <malay>penanggal yang takde</malay> so basically the <malay>apa tu</malay> the organs that [one] right ya it's not a joke my dad used to [oh] ya you know I I did the interview right so basically (uh) for our interview for the coding in school right for class so my dad actually used to work for telcom
you know <malay>zaman dulu</malay> is <malay>yang apa tu tali dia</malay> hanging [kan] <malay>kat atas</malay> it wasn't underground like now [kan] ya so basically singapore [ha] <malay>kat</malay> <malay>kat</malay> malaysia <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>kat</malay> singapore [lah] so basically like <malay>apa tu</malay> they had to change <malay>dia punya</malay> lines <malay>kadang-kadang kalau kadang-kadang dia</malay> (uh) telephone <malay>lama dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>rosak</malay> then he was one of the people who go and repair
ya it was [ah] it's technician [ah] electric <malay>punya</malay> technician so basically what happened was that you know if you <malay>tukar senja-senja</malay> you'll see sometimes the <malay>penanggal</malay> head will get stuck at the at the hanging lines
no how to say [eh] <malay>penanggal</malay> is not really <malay>macam</malay> it's not like <malay>hantu raya</malay> it's not like <malay>pontianak</malay> it's not dead [oh] it's practice they say [eh] they <malay>pengamal</malay> they like <malay>orang minyak</malay> [kan] <malay>amal</malay> black magic so it's like <malay>apa tu</malay>
[ha] they practise [ah] but I don't remember what was the reason I know I know (err) <malay>orang minyak</malay> is to be good looking or something
I don't remember I think he was ugly or something then he say that he wants to like he was sick of people making fun of him or something <malay>aku tak ingat</malay> right no no no he made a made a <malay>perjanjian dengan syaitan</malay> then to like to make himself look handsome LOL then that's called something called plastic surgery [sia] plastic surgery
but like I kind of understand because when you work with not <malay>bomoh</malay> [lah] but you work with <malay>syaitan</malay> right it's natural I guess I mean the fact that you don't have
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess (err) I don't know [lah] I mean #allahu alam# [ah] [eh]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>suka hati kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay>
that's why I say I don't know you go Google [lah] I don't know what else [ah]
[oh] <malay>dia nak makan anak dia</malay> I think
[oh] <malay>awet muda</malay>
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
you know the story about the there are like people I remember one of the incredible tales and actually it happened if you I don't know if you notice but when people get (uh) malay people pregnant right they will put things under their what was it pillow put things at their <malay>tingkap</malay>
people correct
I guess it's kind of make sense but I mean if it was a follow [ah] they say that (err) they put because they are this one <malay>jin</malay> or ghost [kan] <malay>hantu</malay> [kan] that will actually steal the baby ya it's the same <malay>jin</malay> that you were telling me that day we were talking about that day I think
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
scared the heck out of me they eat the ya the <malay>rahim</malay> they they eat the <malay>janin</malay> right they that's why they say [what] <malay>zaman dulu maghrib</malay> [jer] <malay>tutup tingkap</malay> then they then they will hang like <malay>paku-paku atau punya apa tu</malay>
<malay>garam</malay> kind of I don't know this I don't know for some reason <malay>garam</malay> is apparently quite useful in like islamic practices right they use it as border ya I don't know is that I don't know is that how my dad <malay>pagar rumah</malay> or not but ya
ya they say what is it [ah] what what <malay>daun apa</malay> also not <malay>ketumbar</malay> but they say LOL <malay>ketumbar untuk makan</malay> there's one <malay>daun</malay> they use to like <malay>apa tu</malay>
I don't know what's the name of the <malay>daun</malay> but it's like
ya I I they say that it cleanses something no I don't remember but if I remember I'll tell you but it's like ya they say it clean like <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
<malay>anasir-anasir sihir</malay> or something like that
no it's
islam
they said they use it for <malay>kalau orang kena rasuk ke kena rasuk kena apa tu kena hantar apa tu sihir ke</malay> they use the <malay>daun</malay> or something I don't remember this one <malay>daun</malay> they even sell <malay>sabun</malay> or like <malay>sabun</malay> because who want to buy <malay>daun</malay> and go and clean yourself
use it's the same idea as <malay>tanah liat</malay> you know so you touch pig or dog you can just wipe what ya technology ya
but ya actually a lot of the #jins# are quite chicken [sia] I heard a lot of people right need to be careful like you know people give birth right you don't know who the one who <malay>sambut</malay> the baby
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean (uh) you hear stories that sometimes inside the
(mm) they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right [eh] no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it [lah]
I mean like I said [lah] the the the <malay>jin</malay> we were talking about this it eats (uh) it steals babies and things like that that's why they say [what] actually the the reason behind [oh] need to go back inside the house (uh) (uh) <malay>sebelum maghrib</malay> right
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so (mm) I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
(mm)
(mm)
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
but ya you can you imagine the doctor when got nurse then <malay>sekali</malay> got extra nurse the one that <malay>sambut</malay> your baby [oh] no [oh] my god hell no because my mum says that it's very <malay>keras</malay> [lah] that's why I was so scared when I was hospitalised early this year I was like but then again new places also got things [what] everywhere got things [what] even talking about them right now confirm they'll be like [oh] they talking about me
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
(ugh) two bad you don't you don't go to camp [sia] but that time when I was like red cross in brownies I always had camps right sometimes like when you too tired I don't know whether it's a hallucination or not but I'm pretty sure I'm not because what I'm the kind right once I sleep I like if world war three happens also I wouldn't wake up I will sleep even when a bomb drops ya <malay>tidur mati</malay> [ah] ya then like so basically what happened was that I was awake I woke up I was groggy but I was awake I mean I'm blind [lah] I wear specs [lah] but I was awake but I saw like something at the end of my bed like standing
I was looking at it okay <malay>baca apa kau aku baca pun kena kacau</malay> that's why
<malay>baca ke tak baca</malay> it won't stop me from getting disturbed
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also [what] they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a like I mean a lot of like while (uh) psychological study said that [oh] it's just like (uh) was it what [seh]
<malay>khayalan menjelma</malay>
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
is it but then again when you hear about like I see like all the <malay>syarahan-syarahan</malay> they say actually <malay>jin</malay> can <malay>apa tu</malay> manipulate your dreams things like that even when they actually disturb you they can't touch you they can only manipulate your mind right
like you said [what] they can (uh) what is it [ah] they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
I think rather than <malay>hasutan</malay> right if they can insert images in your brain when you're sleep right they can do the same when you are awake [what] ya so basically it's not exactly <malay>hasutan</malay> but it's more of because <malay>hasutan</malay> are words right they play with your mind ya definitely even when you see (err) like english like like american horror movies or things like that if you realise that most of it is just ya they play with your mind
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
like because sometimes I don't know some people they say [what] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>iman kuat</malay> or <malay>semangat kuat</malay> or something right then they said that <malay>apa tu</malay>
[oh] so since like this person <malay>semangat kuat akan</malay> disturb so I'm like ya like how my my sister <malay>lemah semangat</malay> [kan] so <malay>dia</malay> <malay>kena kacau</malay> instead of my father
because my <malay>kakak penakut</malay> I think no wonder <malay>anak dia pun ikut</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> #bushu# can you open the light for me mother never open the door please [lah] how old already you put switch on the light [lah] your house also it's not like house haunted okay actually ya maybe I don't know also her house maybe haunted because I <malay>kena</malay> tap before
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night [lah] around four
I was rushing it was her birthday soon so I was like I was like sewing then I was like trying on the feet [lah] whether it fits well the shoulders are okay I was looking in the mirror then suddenly I felt like a huge like a solid tap on my shoulder you know you can feel the tap you know and I was like I switch I turn the I turn the mirror like around then I was like I never disturb you you don't disturb me [ha] I want to sleep you don't disturb me and then I I just I I didn't switch off the light I went to my bed I just play the phone the whole night I don't dare the next day I went to sleep with my mum I was so scared I was like [oh] my god the heck tap me is different you know if it's like just <malay>khayal</malay> like if it's like (uh) you mean if it's your imagination right you will feel someone walk behind you or something but this [one] is not I felt sold tap like someone tapping my shoulder sounds like
what
no shit [oh] hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
<malay>ustaz</malay> say they cannot show themselves doesn't mean they can't touch you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
[oh] my god have you seen the the <malay>penampakan</malay> like and the videos and like got one video right I think malaysia or something
like the ya the paranormal activity kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby [oh] my god [ha]
(mm) that's why [ah]
I honestly feel that K [lah] the one that I I I I'm a sceptic [lah] like you if you post on <malay>macam</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang buka</malay> <malay>dia orang macam tunjuk</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang nak</malay> views #kot#
I feel like I I believe more those <malay>yang macam</malay> amateur amateur ones that <malay>macam</malay> a that [one] scares me for real like I saw one [kan] and he was like
waiting for her boyfriend then they were talking talking then her boyfriend go out she go out with her boyfriend then then there's <malay>ada</malay> show that she was talking talking talking then she U-turn back go back in the room use her phone
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the (uh) door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia [lah] you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
then because singapore I feel like singaporeans by that time singapore was modernise malaysia still <malay>kampung</malay> #kot#
maybe <malay>dia orang tak</malay> no it's not that practice no if you realise a lot like like I said my
can I even say this though it's like like my <malay>nenek ada saka</malay> [kan]
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
but then again for malaysia even now there's people who still have <malay>saka</malay>
I think [oh] I don't know I do know there some #bomohs# in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise [ah]
I I like it's hard to find people with <malay>susuk</malay> in singapore LOL they might just as well put fillers [kan] it's easier to find a doctor than a bloody <malay>bomoh</malay> ya that's why might as well just put on lip fillers and nose fillers then you go and find <malay>bomoh bomoh</malay> pun (uh) !wah! golden golden <malay>apa tu</malay>
(uh) <malay>apa tu susuk emas dalam muka saya biar biar awet muda</malay> LOL what
so <malay>leceh</malay>
(mm)
ya then I guess the I mean even your boob getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't I guess it won't expo and stuff [lah] but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay [lah] it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya [oh] because it will like corrode or something is it [oh] ya ya
okay
but ya
for <malay>susuk</malay> or like if you <malay>jaga</malay> like if you <malay>ada saka ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>kena jaga lama</malay> [seh] [ha] <malay>kain kuning</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut kuning ayam ayam seekor</malay> so <malay>apa tu tangga galah tangga tak boleh</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay>
I don't know I don't know I don't have <malay>susuk</malay> I don't have <malay>saka buluh</malay> #kot# <malay>buluh</malay>
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>payung</malay>
I don't know I think <malay>buluh</malay> has some
I don't know like how you know certain like I said <malay>daun</malay> or <malay>air garam</malay> maybe like <malay>buluh</malay> has some
I don't know some
[ah] ya something like that I'm not sure
<malay>dia</malay> docker <malay>ke apa</malay> metal
I don't know I mean okay but I mean if it's <malay>galah galah galah galah</malay> metal <malay>kat dalam rumah apa kalau</malay> metal <malay>kat dalam rumah apa</malay> you need to walk under the <malay>galah</malay>
but why would you walk under the <malay>galah</malay> when there's clothes dirty water will drip on you anyway
would you walk under the <malay>galah</malay> if there's like dirty clothes above your head no why would I want underwear water on my hair
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
I guess but then again if you do <malay>susuk</malay> probably you won't you will be more aware [lah] I mean <malay>zaman sekarang</malay> I wouldn't know [lah] <malay>tengah main</malay> handphone !alamak! <malay>jalan bawah galah bodoh apa</malay> the heck but ya
<malay>kau ingat kau ingat</malay> burger <malay>ke apa dah terkeluar masuk balik</malay> I mean I don't think it's so easy to remove
but this ya
but I want one thing I'm I'm thinking is that what did they say once it comes out <malay>terkeluar</malay> right you because [ah] you become uglier
that's what they say if your your <malay>susuk keluar</malay> you become <malay>buruk</malay>
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [eh]
(err) accord sort is it they show you stuff
<malay>macam</malay> botox [ah] it's just that botox is (err) it stays inside your skin
like and stays forever
ya boy
(mmhmm)
I guess so can you imagine your <malay>bomoh</malay> dies then you're you're you are no [lah] [eh] but then
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
<malay>nazak</malay> right I think that's I think that's common [ah]
so you suffer more when you die [ah] <malay>macam saka</malay> [ah]
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you cannot die <malay>tenteram</malay>
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
they say when they leave you to put inside your <malay>kubur apa tu tujuh kaki dalam tujuh kaki</malay> wide thing
you still can feel them lowering you down and things like that they can they can feel you <malay>kafan</malay> you they they can feel them showering you things like that
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
it's like <malay>pakai baju biasa</malay> [ah] [eh] please [lah] you haven't die your clothes so thick already you wear so many layers <malay>kafan</malay> won't kill you it's just one layer you probably
probably you be shivering like !alah! <malay>asal dia orang tak taruk banyak</malay> cloth <malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>sejuk</malay> [siol] <malay>bajet ke satu</malay> layer [jer] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal tapi</malay> [eh] <malay>dia orang kafan sampai tu apa</malay>
<malay>kain kafan</malay> all the way <malay>apa</malay> guess you have stockings
<malay>kain batik</malay> just to cover your <malay>atas</malay> [jer] but your <malay>kafan</malay> is all white [ah]
it's just to cover the face so people don't <malay>macam</malay> stare at you or something it's just <malay>macam</malay> you okay if like you eat <malay>nasi lemak</malay> will you eat the wrapper
no you will eat the rice and the chicken and the <malay>sayur</malay> all [what]
[ha]
I don't know I mean depends on the family (uh) because you are unless
you not supposed to say this [lah] but unless the
<malay>mayat jijik</malay> [ah] no but there are cases if you know right when #allah# <malay>tak nak terima</malay> your death [kan] then you <malay>apa ada</malay> the maggots or like <malay>ular atau apa tu nanah</malay>
it will push you back out or like your <malay>kubur</malay> will be filled with water things like that then I don't think the family members wanna keep either they just I think they just probably throw it away or like keep it
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>duduk balik</malay> is it
pass to you
no [lah] what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
they just I I the one that I know is <malay>jangan</malay> when they say <malay>terima tak</malay> or whatever <malay>ambil beban ke apa</malay> don't just just don't say yes there's no respond
<malay>biar</malay> #allah# <malay>ambil beban</malay>
or may #allah# take your <malay>syaitan</malay>
ya I think so it's an agreement [lah] basically you are agreeing [what] if you nod it's a form of agreement [what] no matter
during <malay>nazak</malay> a lot of people pass cause I heard one time
they had to open the <malay>bumbung</malay> you know zinc <malay>kampung</malay> right so they use zinc <malay>punya bumbung</malay> [kan] so for like when the person <malay>tengah nazak</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang buka dia punya bumbung tu biar</malay>
<malay>kau ingat kau kau ingat</malay> convertible <malay>ke apa</malay> they had to climb and open it [lah] <malay>kau ni</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay> but ya [lah] they have to open the zinc <malay>bumbung</malay> then it's like let the
ya if the thing leaves [ah] because I think I I don't know if you saw <malay>yang jangan pandang belakang</malay> they they the thing couldn't get out so it's just sticking at the walls climbing and all until the guy <malay>terima nenek dia punya benda tu</malay> I'm so glad when my grandma never pass to my mum no it's more like the thing doesn't want my mum
because my my my mum <malay>cakap</malay> the thing
he's recording [sia] the thing <malay>apa tu</malay>
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
I don't know I don't have a I don't have a <malay>saka</malay>
I don't have a <malay>saka</malay> I'm a sucker but I don't have a <malay>saka</malay> you get me but ya it's like (um)
how to say [eh]
I
lame okay and my mum said [lah] my mum said [lah] [eh] she said that the thing picks a master that is like
don't have worldly desires <malay>tak tamak tak apa tu tak jahat tak tamak tak jahat</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
basic willing to help people <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] sincere [lah] so maybe like
it pick my grandma because of that but none of my <malay>pakcik makcik</malay> and my mum because my mum was definitely money money money my mum !wow! she went out to work work work work she said she had no life she that she did nothing but just work I ask her what's her hobby it's work
for real
ya because <malay>zaman tu</malay> right <malay>zaman tu perempuan kena cuci rumah</malay> and <malay>masak</malay>

or the other alternative
but like what
or another way to do it is <malay>macam</malay> we we take the train [ah]
ya actually that <malay>apa tu aku</malay> always <malay>macam</malay> like find it's better to <malay>macam</malay> take the train <malay>macam</malay> more scenic and then you can see the
the not so
popular sites then <malay>kau tengok macam</malay> how the <malay>orang-orang tinggal dekat tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tanah lapang</malay> [kan]

seems familiar
from griffiths primary [ah] thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
(mm) okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya [lah] griffiths (uh) primary is the one next to my place [ah]
[ah]
no no ya now renamed to #angsana#
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
#angsana# griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
maybe like past years like
you know there's an A rates <malay>macam</malay> top scorer
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
[ah] speaking of which
<malay>anak saudara aku</malay>
<malay>masuk</malay> #angsana# primary <malay>aku pernah agak</malay> [kan]
ya <malay>masuk</malay> #angsana# primary okay
<malay>pasal</malay> next year relocate to
<malay>tempat baru tu</malay>
[eh] not next year [ah] <malay>tahun dua ribu</malay>
<malay>dua puluh dua</malay>
<malay>pergi yang tempat baru yang dekat rumah abang aku</malay> [ah] <malay>sana</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> #tampines# green riches
[ah]
#tampines# <malay>yang aku cakap dengan kau yang ada sekolah</malay> learning kids [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah]
<malay>kat situ</malay>
<malay>ada satu tanah lapang dorang tengah buat sekolah kat situ jadi</malay> #angsana# <malay>akan</malay> shift <malay>sana jadi dia akan kat sini</malay> for <malay>satu tahun</malay>
then (err)
<malay>lepas tu tukar</malay> [ah] <malay>tukar kat tempat baru</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>jadi aku boleh skodeng dia</malay>
<malay>skodeng</malay> [eh] word <malay>melayu ke tu</malay>
ya
okay [lah]
<malay>tengah lagipun kakak ipar aku</malay> like <malay>tengah fikir apa ni</malay>
like <malay>macam mana nak</malay> transport <malay>dia pergi sana pergi sekolah</malay>
school bus <malay>mahal</malay>
<malay>tak tahu tapi kalau dia ambil</malay> one way [jer]
less I think <malay>dorang cakap potong</malay> ten dollars [jer] which is <malay>merepek</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>patut</malay> like half price of it <malay>ni macam potong berapa</malay> dollar [jer]
ya
so anyway like that [ah] so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
<malay>dia bangun siang sikit jauh sikit kat sini tapi kesian pula</malay>
primary one <malay>lagi baru</malay> transit
<malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>apa ni dah berapa waktu</malay> [eh]
[oh] how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
<malay>kalau tak nanti</malay> wasted <malay>nanti kita tadi</malay>
!woohoo!
!wah!
so the kid
but he's not present [lah] for that two months or he's still [orh]
[orh]
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer [lah] in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better [lah] because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but ya
ya
(mm)
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
<malay>semua sama</malay> it's like
(uh) ya
ya then everytime like your work <malay>macam</malay> you have to go down to their level then <malay>macam</malay> you need to <malay>macam</malay> if like you guiding them you have to like <malay>macam</malay> bend also
<malay>pergi urut</malay> [ah]
<malay>pergi urut</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> pregnant <malay>kau tak boleh</malay> request <malay>macam kau ajar</malay> like
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
[oh]
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[oh] no because like <malay>macam</malay>
in primary school [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah]
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate (uh) like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
<malay>macam</malay> if that those train multiple subjects [lah] and like what levels you will prefer to teach or if you prefer to <malay>macam</malay> follow up with the class you know so <malay>macam</malay> but again that is subject to like ya approval and also the needs of the school they always have to make that clause
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the the principals [ah]
ya (uh) head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
the department [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the direction of it
ya
but they also <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] they also do school duties stuff like that ya but I know [ah] actually my [ah]
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know [lah] what they do
<malay>teh apa</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi nampak dorang macam nampak dorang macam</malay> <malay>sibuk juga</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>pasal dorang macam</malay> in between the free period <malay>dorang kena macam</malay>
you know settle some like don't know [lah] some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching [eh]
ya
I think like can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
<malay>habis berbual dengan ni</malay> [eh]
[ha] <malay>korang yang dengar ni korang tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>gaji cikgu-cikgu berapa</malay> ya
[orh] [ah]
I think (err)
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like [eh] I mean my previous school [lah]
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
but my previous school you just print it will auto ya so I was like [eh] I I <malay>aku nampak</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ada orang</malay> print <malay>apa</malay> itinerary [lah] <malay>dah nak</malay> holiday [kan] and itinerary holiday [lah] <malay>lepas tu</malay> flight (uh) flight <malay>punya</malay> information <malay>semua</malay>
then <malay>satu tu aku nampak</malay> (oo) <malay>gaji tapi aku macam</malay> okay <malay>aku tak nak tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>tak nak tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi tak boleh tertengok juga</malay> <malay>aku tengok ni cikgu lepas tu aku pun</malay> <malay>fikir ni</malay> [kan] <malay>macam rahsia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> then <malay>aku tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ni nama siapa lepas tu macam mata tak boleh</malay> stop <malay>gitu aku kena tengok juga</malay>
<malay>tu cikgu</malay>

[orh]
okay [lah] ya [lah]
<malay>dia pun macam manusia juga</malay>
but uni
<malay>cakap pasal belajar</malay>
ya
because that time I think (uh)
<malay>pusat</malay> #taufiq# like did a poll on the story did you see
whether like (um) like
we are we prefer I think east side or west side something like that [lah] or <malay>tanya</malay> like <malay>mana kita tinggal</malay> [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
<malay>timur ke barat</malay>
[ah] no ya but from from the way the question they ask she ask like <malay>macam ni</malay> [ah] they're kind of expected right
and some more it's like a prime <malay>macam</malay>
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
because the second level is the <malay>turun barang punya</malay> [kan] then <malay>tangga naik atas</malay> then I think they have posted they posted some photos also of their office I think their office <malay>macam</malay>
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya [lah]
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
I don't know because I saw just now you saw or not <malay>dia punya</malay> story
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
<malay>ada</malay> [oh] okay
ya
I think I saw (um) another person who who has a shop at the building posted that view before <malay>macam macm dia tengah kat</malay> treadmill <malay>lepas tu depan tu</malay> swimming pool
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think (err) central port
it's (err) #geylang# #geylang#
<malay>kau tahu yang dekat yang</malay> petrol station #geylang# <malay>tu</malay>

then <malay>ada</malay> petrol station just before the bus stop <malay>yang pasar</malay> ya I think along that stretch

my name is #Intan# and this is weird
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe <malay>entah bah</malay>
wait wait wait so <malay>kirakan</malay> like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like (err)
later on like the when the government give like the government (um) announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give (uh) you
ya we top we we top the rank [ah] isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasti</malay>
okay well
well as you know [lah] [kan] I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January (um) there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report (uh) Singapore reported their first case
but by that time (um) we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like <malay>kita pergi</malay> #Bangkok# for like <malay>satu minggu</malay> holiday
even though like you know there were threats of (um) like you know this unknown virus being spread around [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
like we didn't care so (err) after that when (err) Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
we went to Japan <malay>habis habis lepas tu</malay> was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking <malay>nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal</malay>
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but (err) my my boyfriend was like the most #kiasu# of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most #kiasu# and he was very irritating
<malay>dia pakai dia</malay> the kind <malay>macam dia pakai</malay> mask
and then is like he just insist [ah] right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
<malay>habis</malay> like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a (uh) metal tube with like hundreds of (um) other people like he will refuse to wear <malay>dia punya</malay> mask and I'm like
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> so anyway
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know #Tokyo# is near
#Yokohama# no is it is it near I mean like (err) there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in #Tokyo# [lah] so
(err) we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like (err) luckily we came back right before when (err) Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other and (um) and whatever
sorry so ya <malay>begitu</malay> [lah] but ya then after that it's like (err)
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
(uh) they took unpaid leave and then after that (err) I I I <malay>tanya dia orang</malay> [lah] like [eh] so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on (err) what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then <malay>dorang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> lucky [sia] <malay>kau</malay> (um) (um) you left at a very good time and then I'm like
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
but ya <malay>macam begitu</malay> [ah] and (err) like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
so I can balance I can juggle my life with (err) studies I can keep my time occupied [eh] and like you know just do my stuff
you do you remember that (um) the viral video that fiasco the whole #Ateeqah Mazlan# <malay>punya benda</malay> that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like <malay>macam padanlah muka dia</malay>
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up <malay>siapa</malay> is it or something is it I can't remember
ya <malay>habis tu apa macam</malay> like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them <malay>dia macam nak dia berniat nak</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> I think I think her <malay>niat</malay> is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place (um) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) like the current regulations that are in place (mm) related to home based business <malay>begitu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> satisfy is like an understatement because <malay>dorang</malay> I mean like you know like <malay>melayu punya</malay> backlash is like next level <malay>dorang macam</malay> like [oh] (err)
(err) <malay>dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup</malay>
[kan] as in what do they say (uh) they said something about like (err) <malay>nak tutupkan</malay> (err) <malay>nak kacau periuk</malay> [ah]
<malay>periuk nasi orang</malay> something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
<malay>dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi</malay> so funny
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her [lah] but as in like the fact is that like stupid [sia] you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible
okay I did not think that it was our good friend #Hadi# <malay>pasal si</malay>
[oh] my god stereotype [sia]
that's another unwanted
of course [lah] I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID [eh] sorry during it's like people will stuck at home okay <malay>lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan</malay> [kan]
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum <malay>macam</malay> frus
then after that she was like (err) even at times at times we we I suggest [lah] okay I say nevermind [lah] mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
<malay>dia orang masih kerja</malay> like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than (uh) more than ever and like
it's still a <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja tu kerja</malay> [lah] but like you know
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some <malay>macam</malay>
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked (err) they they featured some characters like you know (um) everyday Singaporeans and everything
(um) like I think one of them was about like (uh) a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to (uh) the needy [lah] basically and (uh) you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not (err) feature
food deliverer (uh) like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like (um) healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
(err) like you know like for example they they do a they did a feature on like the (uh) cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
the <malay>apa tu barang barang</malay> for the (err) how do you say the the items for the supermarket [kan]
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
how how long is that show two hours is like <malay>dua jam</malay> I don't think you can like squeeze everything together [lah]
[oh] really
[oh] it wasn't cheap
(mmhmm) but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
highly taxing job for example [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like in a family a a low income family of like for example <malay>dia punya anak dia</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia</malay> special needs kid
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay> the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older <malay>habis dorang tak ada</malay> they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
(um) you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like (um) not considered
people who are like who are eligible for like <malay>macam</malay> help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular (um) like income ceiling for example and then after that like <malay>macam</malay> (err)
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like (err) very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like <malay>macam</malay> you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
[eh] what
but in order to in order to get
(mm)
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so <malay>macam</malay> I guess
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like (err) because (err) <malay>apa</malay>
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that (um) like
(err) the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading (err) (um) like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very <malay>leceh pasal</malay> like you know because
there were at least <malay>macam</malay> twenty people in the class then after that like (err) we
(err) our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking [lah] like [eh] so how [ah] you think that next year [ah] no sorry next sem which is like in a month (um)
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so <malay>macam kita</malay> very move very FOMO
so so (um)
(err) we we were like somehow like quite happy that (uh) we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then (err) then we we tested out the Zoom (err) interface then it of like sucked [lah] because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then (err) we had exams
and this was the very funny part so <malay>kita orang punya</malay> exams we <malay> kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one [eh] <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
what is that module I took I forgot [oh] (uh) it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
we were revising and basically we were revising based on (err) what the exam usually entails [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
like like <malay>ada</malay> <malay>ada</malay> open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sitting for the exams then COVID happened
so basically we were stuck at home so (err) like the school has to think about something
(err) so that time <malay>nak</malay> like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working [ah]
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
(uh) there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book <malay>tapi kita orang macam</malay> like
[eh] get real [lah] <malay>kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan</malay> you know go on Whatsapp <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> text [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak</malay> what's this what's the answer for this but in
<malay>tak ada tak ada</malay>
so it's like (um) basically we were (err) there are there are like three different kinds of exam so <malay>macam</malay> like open task
so this open task (err) is like
a forty eight hour it opens like (uh) forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then (err) it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like (err) by one thirty on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
so <malay>macam</malay> like we get on we we all got go online <malay>lepas tu</malay> we all sit down together
<malay>buka tu</malay> link <malay>duduk</malay> for two hours <malay>ku duduk situ</malay>
<malay>kau buat tu</malay> (err) exam just like a normal exam <malay>tapi</malay> (err) <malay>ni</malay> in the comfort of your own home <malay> begitu
well nothing because okay for that <malay>macam</malay> the time exam [kan] the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on [lah]
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me [ah] I personally I rather do myself [ah] because I know I can do it
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like <malay>ada</malay> forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a assignment so basically I had to do (err)
stuff !hais! like I prepared questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
[ha] you <malay>memang betik</malay>
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to [lah] as in like you know when I left
when I left (err) when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
[eh] thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful [ah] sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work [lah]
I enjoyed my life met so many many different people <malay>habis lepas tu</malay> like now (err) <malay>bila</malay> I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and [oh] my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
(mmhmm)
(ugh) I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive [lah] I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now <malay>pasal</malay> like (err) how to say this like (um) I'm much older than I was obviously
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up [lah] you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the (err) that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it [lah] okay like my my classmates [ah] my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
<malay>dia pandai tahu dia pandai</malay> she graduated from mass comm [eh] no she graduated from advertising
#Ngee Ann# similar course <malay>tapi dia punya dia punya</malay>
distracted <malay>tak tak boleh tahan</malay> so I had a project before just like <malay>macam</malay> like maybe two weeks ago ya so <malay>dia sibuk dengan dia punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>punya</malay> birthday
<malay>habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam</malay> you know it's a group work
so <malay>nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk</malay> and then discuss <malay>lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa</malay> in a powerpoint
presentation <malay>nak kena</malay> prepare <malay>pasal kita orang ada</malay> presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that <malay>kita kena buat</malay> like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life [kan]
I said to her okay you know what <malay>aku buat aku buat yang</malay> lit review <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang</malay>
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like <malay>macam kita orang punya</malay> (um) information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report <malay>itu pun dia tak boleh buat</malay>
and
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so <malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>dia boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi mana mana</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia punya</malay> twenty third birthday <malay>dia pergi</malay> prepare all the <malay>apa tu</malay>
gifts for him <malay>bagai</malay> can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
because is like even though when I was working <malay>tak ada</malay> chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
[eh]
<malay>itu</malay> part time just
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay [lah] I I don't think my my (err) my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
we are online (uh) we doing online lessons right now [kan] so like half the time <malay>kita</malay>
(um) <malay>kita</malay> log-on like at 9 o'clock
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture (uh) eleven (uh) sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and <malay>leceh gila</malay> then I was like (err)
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>malas</malay> [ah] but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks (um)
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that <malay>duduk dekat atas meja</malay> [lah] and do my work
and then !huh!
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time (err) by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that [lah] so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on (err) in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
this semester so I <malay>macam</malay> like to be able to connect with them in a level (err) I mean like online everything is very cool
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
<malay>apa punya</malay>
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free [eh] (uh huh)
(mm)
as in this particular Food Panda thing <malay>dia punya</malay> promo [jer] <malay>daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja</malay> as in like (err)
no because
no no no like like periodically right periodically (um) (err) Grab host like have this like (err) promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer (um) a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then [oh] no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
(uh) the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so (err) ya
and then (err) so isn't like basically is this was this (uh) service available on (err) Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course [lah] because now everybody can go out already [what]
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know #Nurul# is (err) #Nurul# has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya

[ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (hmm)
(mmhmm) true true true true true
I mean to me it's good in a way like (um) all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to (um) the recordings [lah] because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching [ah] like ya as you said [ah] traditional traditional methods are the best [ah]
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like !aiya! I appreciate [lah] they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
(mm) (mm) and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all [lah] like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya [lah] I really appreciate that part ya
(mmhmm) I mean
okay it's really draining
(err) cause like the
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya I mean usually we we (uh) our exam <malay>punya</malay> duration would be like three hours right
ya then (um) like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days [ah] for forty eight hours [ah] so that was really crazy [ah]
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest [lah] because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
(um)
(uh) know
ya like
cause ya but but but but it's not the usual [ah] question answer kind of thing [ah] cause ya ya cause it's like (um) I'm taking it (uh) for this for this forty hours exam is like it's it's it's (err) what's the subject [oh] education secondary (uh) educational psychology <malay>nya</malay> subject so it's like
(um) (hmm) so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean (uh) I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like (um) it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given [lah] so it's really appropriate [lah] I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya (mm)
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] like (err) initially I was like
(um) ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us [lah] (err) beforehand she was like (um) ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like !huh! really forty eight hours then she she she was like
[ah] later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like

ya they they they they ask us [ah] like (um) are you guys okay
(um) ya like (um) if you I mean you know some some wouldn't be okay with like having group assignment right
cause like due to I don't know maybe different time zones or such so they like give us like (um) options if you want to do like if you want to go for like individual (err) individual or like group assignment [ah] things like that [lah] so like they like I would say they cater and accommodate to us [ah] to our needs [ah]
but then ya she mentioned [ah] like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
[oh] they usually ask us to tell the students that it's
okay (uh)
I mean like to go lenient on them [ah] but then she she like somehow like rant to us ranted to us [ah] she was like but then they never
(uh) take care of their like the the the lecturers [lah] like cause they are also like going through new things right like to have like a full-fledged [ah] online classes is equally like very (uh) what difficult for them [lah] basically

like you want to buy groceries and such [ah] I mean ya so I mean I mean I'm good [ah] I I mean I think
that I just like to stay at home so I've been coping it well [ah] I would say I binge watch drama cause like I mean cause we haven't started our classes right ya
so I've only like I I I'm taking these I mean I I took that time like to actually like watch all the drama I missed
and ya before I actually started the online classes [lah] ya you should watch you should try watching (uh) the good place [ah] it's on netflix
it's it's the the good place yes yes yes
(uh) <malay>cerita dia</malay> like it's about (um) <malay>cerita dia</malay> it's about like (um) this person
(uh) she okay it's about afterlife [ah] basically
so it's like they haven't offered the heaven or the hell kind of thing ya so it's like the good place I mean in a sense is like the heaven and the bad place is the hell
so ya so she realised that she's bad and she's placed in the good place then she was wondering [lah] like
[eh] <malay>aku selama ni</malay> (err) <malay>dekat dunia aku aku</malay>
<malay>buat jahat</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi kenapa</malay> like ya <malay>tapi kenapa</malay> like she's quite <malay>dia macam</malay> like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like (um) <malay>tapi kenapa aku dekat</malay> the good place like shouldn't be ya <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tak ke patut</malay> ya [lah] <malay>tak ke patut aku dekat</malay> the bad place ya but then turns out that

<malay>aku tengok</malay> drama [jer] the world of married
it's about this girl she's very successful <malay>macam dia jadi</malay> the associate director
of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her [ah]
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
in the first place <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> whether she
he really cheat <malay>dekat dia ke tak</malay> eventually [ah] she found out [ah] and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl <malay>macam</malay>
although <malay>dia tahu</malay> that he is a married man <malay>dia tetap nak dengan</malay>
that guy [ah] then that eventually
(um)
because the guy has always been <malay>macam</malay>
living off from her wealth
so <malay>dia</malay> the wife
was actually very very very
(um)
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
then but then in the end <malay>dorang</malay>
(uh) <malay>cerai</malay> [lah]
then <malay>cerai</malay> the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama [ah]
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage [ah] because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
(uh) you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this (uh) phrase
[ah] loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
ya
but
now like the story I <malay>masih kat</malay> episode nine so like
(uh) they got divorce but then
the (uh) kay the son right is so irritating [seh] <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>besar pun dia macam</malay>
<malay>macam selenger selenger gitu</malay>
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
(um)
she like restrained herself
cause <malay>dia tak nak</malay>
<malay>anak dia ataupun dia tak nak macam</malay> involve
in this kind of thing again [ah] drama again
ya
(mm)
but then I heard that
I mean [lah] I don't know cause #Syamsul Yusof# has always been
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> how to say [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> rumours <malay>pasal dia</malay> like you know remember about Diana Danielle also
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love [what] like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore [kan]
because I heard that he stole something and everything
I mean he really got really really <malay>macam</malay> soul soulless again
but
I don't know [lah] how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
[oh] wells
ya
ya
but
I don't know [lah]
[ah] up to him [lah] he celebrity [lah]
but you know (um) you know I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] if I want to do my hair tomorrow <malay>ke tak</malay>
ya the original price is about three hundred fifty [seh] and hundred fifty for three hundred fifty treatment
then right I see their steps like firstly they will like massage
then after that they will like put essential oil for you to relax then they will put something for your scalp then they wash
then after that they put like this
beads then they crush it then they put like the medicine the carotese medicine or what
then after that they steam
after they steam then (uh)
okay already like they blow dry
(mm) I like I mean I've booked for tomorrow but I don't know what time what time you going school [ah]

<malay>tak sabar</malay> [seh]
I never know why
well cause maybe you don't really get sense of security there like everyday it's like it's playing with your anxiety did you do something wrong or not
ya
why I mean like even if I were to continue my studies I don't think I'll be in the same school as you
is it cause you <malay>tak</malay>
(uh) used with your friends <malay>lagi kot</malay>
!huh! they you mean you don't #chiong# last minute [one]

overpriced or like they take from Shopee or something
[oh] my god you know like I've been searching for clothes [kan] then most of the clothes <malay>takde</malay> my size [seh] it's like I go to like
AforArcade I go for Modparade I go for Editor's Market actually Editor's Market maybe tomorrow I <malay>tengok</malay> cause

so like one hundred fifty gone
then maybe like fifty gone for transport and like nine thirty gone for
(uh) eat (uh) <malay>apa</malay>

so that would be two hundred fifty then I mean I have like fifty dollars left
like what you cannot also buy [seh] fifty dollars

ya so confirm cannot save like that
I've been trying to save
that's true some more I pay for the bill and then pay for myself

clothes but I thought I wanted to buy him body cause clothes <malay>susah</malay> [ah] for me I need to see his size all then later he cannot wear how
ya some more like clothes hard
cause I don't know whether he will like my taste
but he chose to wear it that's the thing it's
is it then <malay>tak</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak beli</malay> [kan] <malay>dia baju batik</malay> confirm <malay>dia tak beli tak pakai</malay>
no he won't wear purple he say Barney
what serious [ah]
[meh]
exactly he is
[oh] ya that's thing I <malay>takut tak muat</malay> cause
you know got like those like slim fit regular fit all then I don't know all this guy shit
ya that's why I thought just buy <malay>sapu</malay> [jer]
he can <malay>wangi</malay> himself
<malay>lagipun</malay>
that's the easiest
<malay>kalau beli</malay>
(err) clothes then you have to take into
size the design whether it fits
ya
but how is he [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
how is he coping now
in the new work and all
(mm)
<malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang suka</malay> act tough [jer]

ya
(mm)
it's okay [lah] one day I see him [lah] slowly

cause if he's free he will usually go dating [what]
do you like study math anymore no right

(mm)
because like I heard the kid is really struggling as well
ya and then like he needs to take next year and then
he skip his grades are doing really bad right now
so he really needs help

for me <malay>mak dia tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>yang dia tengah</malay> struggle then like
<malay>mak dia</malay> just hantar <malay>dia</malay> to like those like
tuition centre
then it like didn't help him then she don't want to teach him also
then I feel that <malay>macam</malay> if you give up on your own son then what about
people outside [seh]
ya
but actually he's such a nice kid [seh] I kind of miss teaching them <malay>tapi</malay> I really <malay>takde</malay> time <malay>untuk dia</malay> !hais!

#Didi# the dinosaur
and stuff like that
like a little sick cause his mum didn't want him to skip tuition
[oh] my god I think was only fifty
ya last time you also got paid fifty right
no it was never seventy
it was always fifty #Erra#
ya that's why I stop
is like about ten [ah] eleven
or twelve dollar plus
<malay>satu</malay> hours
ya still not worth it
like I know [lah] I get it <malay>dia macam</malay> mentally draining to teach a kid
some more he's very naughty but
I don't know I just <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> I just really hope that he at least
make it to like
make it well
yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
primary school <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
ya
but
(uh) I don't know [ah] it's like you know like how this kind of drama always happen then teachers will talk about it I just feel that the teachers should just stop talking about it <malay>macam dorang</malay> like to pry open to
people private affairs [seh]
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> feeling of a good
relationship I mean
<malay>dengan</malay> teachers
ever since primary school secondary school and days
because I feel that the teachers all <malay>macam</malay> #kaypoh# you know like during my right
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex [ah] my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell (um)
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students [seh] but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that [seh] and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
I <malay>tak suka</malay> [seh]
so traditional
I don't know [lah]
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
!huh! it's not it it's not
<malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> I always <malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
I <malay>pernah lambat</malay>
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no [lah] sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then [oh] ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
then I say [eh] I injured <malay>mesti pakai</malay> ankle guard colour black cause last time we need to wear white socks right
then I'm like [eh] you want to pick fight with me cause of this <malay>merepek</malay> [seh]
don't know
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay [lah] whatever you young but never mind [ah]
but she cannot handle the team well [seh]
she <malay>lepas</malay> [kan] at us so many times
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
at the she was looking <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums [seh]
I remember so many people vomited [ah]
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what [eh] I remember she do the stupid like
(err) push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
<malay>abeh</malay> like we all felt like dogs [seh]
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know [ah]
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
(err) the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
I remember there was this girl <malay>dia macam</malay>
like quite <malay>berbadan</malay> then like she was so <malay>semangat</malay> to go training then after that training I never see her face again
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
[eh]
ya I think I brought the trauma when trauma with me when I <malay>masuk</malay> [ah] <malay>bola</malay> [seh] <malay>masa</malay> I seventeen <malay>kat</malay> cause after that right I <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop [seh]
and like I I feel it's not normal
like before every match <malay>pun</malay> I very <malay>macam</malay>
nervous <malay>semua</malay> you know
!huh!
<malay>tapi</malay>
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
I feel that <malay>dia macam</malay>
help to
discipline us and make us stronger [ah]
cause imagine <malay>kalau kita tak buat</malay> sports [eh] <malay>kita</malay> confirm <malay>tak nak gi lari semua</malay> [seh] cause I see some of my friends <malay>yang tak masuk</malay> sports [kan]

then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive

is better than getting a at this rate

most of them the new ones are built near like
the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
you got see (uh) is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the

hi kira
what are you doing
I I ask what are you doing
what are you doing <malay>bukan</malay> how are you doing
[oh] ya I forgot how is your <malay>haus kau batuk lagi ke</malay>
(mm) cause <malay>aku perasan juga</malay> like I notice your cough in your (um) videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and (um) and also like when you have <malay>kahak</malay> in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not (um) clearing her throat first before she talk
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
<malay>kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke</malay> and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
[oh] okay [lah]
have you how many times you had to use it so far
<malay>susah tak nak pakai tu</malay> like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
[oh] I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like <malay>lambat</malay>
[orh] <malay>kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak</malay> inhale like deeply [ah]
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school <malay>pun</malay> I used to have bad coughs <malay>yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama</malay>
[ah] I used to have to eat a lot of (um) cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic [lah]
(mm)
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was (err) developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my (mm)
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
I have <malay>kahak</malay> so I have a lot of <malay>kahak</malay> that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so <malay>dia macam satu</malay> it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
[ah] so <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> I can recognize it [lah] when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
<malay>macam</malay> at that time I think I didn't know cause [ah] before
how do I what
actually (err) is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is (um) <malay>tempeh</malay>
(err) <malay>roti kicap</malay>
I know I know no but ya I think these three <malay>yang betul betul</malay> I've been avoiding because
(err) at first <malay>memang</malay> I avoided everything I avoided like #vitagen# #yakult# [lah] yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt [ah] <malay>apa tapi macam kalau</malay> yogurt is in (mm) is like a flavor <malay>aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia</malay> is is in at yeast allergy it's like (um) (err) fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast [kan] is a product of fermentation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan</malay> because it's like soy bean fermented
(mmhmm)
<malay>kicap pun aku tak</malay>
[ah]
ya <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> [lah] is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] because (uh) in some <malay>kadang-kadang aku makan</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba macam ni</malay>
(err) <malay>apa gatal</malay> but actually you know (uh) when I went to clinic my it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new <malay>macam</malay> active (err) areas <malay>yang gatal</malay> and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad [ah] episode of sinus <malay>punya ni</malay> like <malay>selsema</malay> for like one month
so my dad told me to start (err) drinking <malay>yang</malay> effervescent tablets <malay>tu barakah</malay>
so I did and then he ask me I started (err) started drinking that and then he said that [oh] ya it's very bad <malay>padahal</malay> [kan] I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains (um) <malay>macam</malay> yeast <malay>ke apa</malay> but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
(err) so (err) <malay>tapi</malay> recently because I at first I <malay>memang betul betul jaga</malay> my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat <malay>kicap</malay> because <malay>kicap</malay> is such a common common thing <malay>kalau kau masak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia</malay>
ya ya no at that time she's making #nasi goreng# #sambal sotong# tau like leftover #sambal sotong# so <malay>dia letak</malay> [lah] <malay>kicap tu sikit</malay> just for flavour
and then I was I already ate like one full plate and then she's like #aina# I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put <malay>kicap</malay> and I was like
<malay>tapi</malay> I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so <malay>malam tu aku macam aku</malay> [dah] ready [lah] <malay>untuk makan ubat</malay>
but I realised that I didn't react
so at that bad <malay>macam</malay> is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the <malay>gatal pun dia kurang</malay> [lah] I can control it so when (err) after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
(uh) nine months since I've been to the doctor
so <malay>macam</malay> I should start
I should start (uh)
trying out food <malay>yang</malay> I'm not eating
so I I drank like vitagen once and it was okay <malay>tapi aku kurang</malay> [lah] I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
[ah] <malay>cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti</malay>
(err) <malay>kicap tempeh</malay> yogurt [jer] [lah]
actually supposed to go and see the doctor <malay>bulan enam</malay> but at that time [kan] I was [ah] I couldn't go because clinic <malay>tu dekat</malay> #tangkak#
ya #tangkak# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# but it's far [lah]
(mm)
#tangkak#
it's
(uh) is like one or two hours
you know why because is <malay>betul betul dekat hujung</malay>
<malay>betul betul dekat hujung dekat</malay> singapore like really is like there
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya
because especially because my house is (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #danga bay# which is
I think [ah] the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
and then my window is facing the (um) memorial the #sungei# that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats <malay>ada kelong</malay> and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya <malay>tapi</malay> I'm I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger [kan] (mm) <malay>kalau kitaorang balik</malay> #johor#
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings [kan] <malay>dorang semua</malay> [dah] ready <malay>bawa</malay> passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip <malay>dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari</malay> (um) like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
juice like the drink yes yes
<malay>dorang</malay> some some [ah] <malay>dorang tak</malay> produce <malay>dorang tak hantar</malay> that brand <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia
at that time [ah]
so they will go there <malay>macam</malay> is a trip for them and then <malay>kitaorang budak-budak</malay> would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
ya and then
we'll all be like so jealous !wah! <malay>tak dapat ikut pergi</malay> singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore <malay>dengan</malay> malaysia <malay>takde beza</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>sebenarnya</malay>
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in (um) in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
ya it's the same I think ya <malay>sama</malay> [jer] it's just that you know at that time I was like !wow! singapore
did you (um) see
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
[ah] that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the <malay>memang</malay> my family <malay>memang suka makan roti kitaorang</malay> we can go through like one <malay>bantal yang besar tu</malay> like two days so now substitute is wraps [lah]
wrap wrap
wrap
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay> always <malay>ada tu</malay> or you know like <malay>prata yang</malay> frozen
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
(mm)
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's (err) you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
croissant croissant <malay>itu memang</malay> one of the <malay>benda yang paling kelakar</malay>
because <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>terbiasa</malay>
ya <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] cousin <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>belajar</malay>
why are you not eating
[oh]
<malay>tunggu</malay> [jer] [lah] lunch is almost lunch time
are you going to cook or [what]
usually <malay>kau yang masak ke</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
[oh] how old is she
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(um) I think <malay>dia tak</malay> not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
(err) routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize [kan] it's not it's not just (um) <malay>sapu</malay> lotion on dry skin you have to be <malay>bilas</malay> with water first and then you have to pat dry and then <malay>baru</malay> you lotion because then <malay>baru dia ada</malay> moisture
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] ya ya <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know if I if I <malay>mandi</malay> awhile like
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
wear it <malay>bilas</malay> and then I put lotion and then is very effective <malay>kalau</malay> you moisturize it overnight
[ah] ya
[ah]
<malay>dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga</malay> that's why you know when I was
(mm)
(mm) but when I was younger and it was bad <malay>memang</malay> my mom would <malay>paksa</malay>
like
if she caught me
(err) because sometimes it hurts tau <malay>untuk mandi</malay> cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
shower
to make sure that I properly (err) you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat (um) olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>macam masa tu</malay> [kan] I
[ah] <malay>tak tak</malay>
<malay>yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia</malay> powder <malay>tapi dia dalam</malay> capsule
[ah] and then [eh] that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills <malay>pasal kau tahu</malay> (uh) <malay>sampai menangis</malay> like I tried to eat it until I cried
and then (err) I gave up you know what I did
I open the capsule onto a spoon <malay>lepastu aku makan</malay>
it's disgusting <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm)
[oh] your your cough medication is too much
<malay>kau makan ubat</malay>
okay [lah] [kan] maybe
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know <malay>potong tiga ke</malay> to get used to it instead of <malay>makan powder</malay> [jer]
(hmm)
[ah] you need to take your time [lah]
(mm) have you have you done the portal
<malay>tapi dia macam</malay> faulty [lah]
can <malay>jap</malay> I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like (uh) after I register <malay>tak boleh nak</malay> log in <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> website <malay>dia macam</malay> faulty <malay>tu yang si</malay> #nai# <malay>cakap semalam dengan</malay> doctor john
[ah] you when you register to use your <malay>apa</malay> <malay>punya</malay> account
(mm)
try [lah] <malay>nanti apa</malay> I think they need to (um) solve on their site before they do before you can log in
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
(mm)
I get it I get it [lah] but thing is <malay>kat</malay> you need like a car
[ah] to go to work
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah] I think that's that's really the only <malay>macam</malay> problem that I have
(mm)
but
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tak banyak pun tapi</malay> they haven't responded to my email
<malay>aku dia ada dia ada dia macam</malay> (err) inquiry box <malay>dekat</malay> website <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive (um) interns undergraduate internship <malay>apa</malay> ya program
<malay>tapi dorang tak</malay> reply maybe I need to email them directly
(mm)
ya actually I I agree <malay>dorang punya</malay> one of the malaysia <malay>punya</malay> government or any authorities when <malay>punya</malay> weak link weak point is that <malay>dorang punya</malay> website is very poorly handle
[kan]
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
[ah] <malay>bukan tak pandai</malay> they don't see the need
[ah] <malay>macam kita</malay> [kan] <malay>apa-apa pun kita akan</malay> website <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] website website
so <malay>tapi aku cari</malay> [lah] <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>pun banyak juga</malay>
more opportunity <malay>banyak tempat</malay> but it's definitely gonna be far from my house [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] as long as you know
[ah] ya
yes <malay>apa ni apa aku cakap</malay> [oh] when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria [kan] <malay>aku pergi dengan</malay> #shikin#
and I saw (um) some of the stuff <malay>dia tengah macam</malay> recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
<malay>macam</malay> like writing on the clipboard so <malay>aku tanya dia aku tanya dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau apa dorang ambil</malay> aquaria <malay>ni ambil</malay> intern <malay>ke lepastu dia kata dia pun</malay> intern
[ah]
<malay>dia cakap apa lagi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya and then she said that (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I ask [lah] <malay>yang selalunya yang</malay> feeding [kan] <malay>yang</malay> diving and feeding <malay>tu dia kata</malay> anyone that has a diving license <malay>boleh</malay> I'm like [ah]
(mm)
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I wonder also
(mm)
it's hard
<malay>jauh ke dari rumah kau</malay>
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's either you have a long commute <malay>atau</malay> you <malay>sewa rumah dekat situ</malay> [lah] <malay>sewa bilik</malay>
(mm) actually actually
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> #fasha# #fasha# <malay>nak buat</malay> intern <malay>kat</malay> #johor#
<malay>sebab</malay> (uh) ya [lah] but she wants to be close with #shami# <malay>dia nak jumpa</malay> [lah]
so this so <malay>kita orang macam</malay> [dah] <malay>pernah cakap sebelum ni</malay> that if she gets an internship in #johor# I would I mean if we get in the around same area
we would rent a place together [ah]
(mm) but don't know [lah]
[ha] <malay>mari mari</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> #johor# <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>besar</malay> so we don't know [lah]
(mm) (mm) <malay>tak tahu kat mana tu</malay> [jer] [ah] when I think that
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
<malay>macam</malay> is I'm so scared
<malay>ye tak pasti macam</malay>
I saw because I did see my brother going through his internship <malay>pun susah gila nak cari</malay> no no company would want
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak nak bayar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I did see some private companies <malay>yang bagi</malay> internship not bad [lah]
I think you just have to find the right one
#wei# you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer [lah]
[oh] [ah]
<malay>takde</malay> I'm trying to find material for my <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor <malay>bagi</malay> like
you know did I explain to you my new title
<malay>dia dia</malay> [kan] my old title was combining water quality <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) macromentoes
so I did my field work <malay>tapi</malay> since we cannot go to the lab
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
(uh) the data is from the paper that he published
<malay>dia</malay> [dah] published [dah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> co author [jer] <malay>dia bukan</malay> the main author doctor #chan# <malay>lepastu dia ada</malay> data <malay>dekat tempat yang sama</malay> of macromentoes so <malay>aku kena</malay> analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper <malay>punya</malay> data
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
<malay>dia punya</malay> paper as a reference for my water quality part
(um) I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know [ha] I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
ya
I also agree about the reading part
<malay>macam aku aku</malay> try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
<malay>pastu</malay> I go back to it and then <malay>aku akan</malay> copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
<malay>pastu</malay> I try to retype it
in a different way
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it becomes <malay>macam</malay> disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>gunanya</malay> supervisor
(mm) so far so far my progress is very little
are we the same
are we the same
[oh] <malay>laju kali ni</malay> supervisor <malay>kau laju</malay>
last sem
last sem <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> supervisor <malay>aku</malay> [jer] <malay>yang asik minta</malay> ya your supervisor was so quiet
I think [kan] I think she knows (uh) means she learn from last sem
<malay>sebab haritu</malay> [kan] <malay>kitaorang ada</malay> meeting mentor mentee [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> doctor #chan#
and then he said that (um) #farid# ask how we how did we do as a class
uhh <malay>macam</malay> on the our presentation <malay>dia cakap</malay>
the examiners all are impressed <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> presentation
<malay>pasal</malay> our presentation wise we are all <malay>macam mantul</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> when it comes to the writing
[ah] writing <malay>kita ada macam</malay> slack
(mm) I think it's a bit it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
(mm)
I think must me and my feelings <malay>pun macam gitu macam</malay>
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
(mm) sometimes <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> [oh] my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it <malay>tapi sebenarnya</malay> okay [jer]
<malay>tak</malay>
(mm)
no but you know [lah] how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
(mm) I think
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
the opposite
because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
[ah] and <malay>tapi aku rasa macam</malay> my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions <malay>dorang akan jawab</malay>
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita nak tahu</malay> [kan] we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
make sense (mm)
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
(hmm)
[ah] <malay>memalukan</malay> like you feel embarrassed
did you hear about the girl
<malay>yang dekat</malay> #terengganu# [eh]
did you hear about the girl <malay>kat</malay> #terengganu#
[ah] <malay>yang kawan</malay> [ah]
#wei# <malay>tu gila</malay> [dah]
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
(mm)
<malay>maksudnya</malay>
<malay>ye lepas lepastu dia boleh</malay> Whatsapp <malay>lagi macam</malay> acting as if like nothing
<malay>macam</malay>
[eh] <malay>bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>macam ramai</malay> [kan] <malay>orang punya</malay> story <malay>macam banyak</malay> version
<malay>kesian</malay> [dah] like
imagine imagine the dad
wife [dah] [lah] <malay>sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang</malay> first [kan]
but it's so sad [lah] <malay>tapi memang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> video evidence [kan] that she entered the house
(mm) <malay>dengan apa</malay> I think like hair in her hand
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> log in [kan]
[dah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I think you just wait [ah] because think somewhat <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
I think someone did text the <malay>yang apa</malay> doctor <malay>jaga situ puan puan</malay> #lin# [eh]
(mm) we just have to wait and see
<malay>adoi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>apa dia</malay>
no if my mum is around I don't cook
(mm)
<malay>aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh</malay> [jer]
I do the after part
(mm)
[kan] <malay>dia macam semak</malay>
[orh] <malay>dia panggil</malay> okay [ah]
I think my
my mum doesn't ask us to help <malay>kalau dia tengah masak</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> after <malay>tu</malay> I usually just go and see [lah] <malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta</malay> [lah] <malay>minta tolong</malay>
excuse me
<malay>aku pun tapi</malay> <malay>aku kurang</malay> [lah] because <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>tengok</malay> drama <malay>yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat</malay> netflix
so <malay>macam</malay> is a lot of more steps to
to watch it <malay>tapi sebab</malay> you know K drama they are so long
<malay>macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ</malay> for an hour to watch it
actually that's why that's why it
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people <malay>punya</malay> comments
but I think the K drama <malay>yang</malay> I watched that had a lot of (err) long episodes was prison playbook
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] I don't usually watch (uh) slice of life <malay>punya</malay> drama
I usually watch <malay>macam</malay> investigative <malay>atau</malay> medical <malay>tapi</malay> somehow prison playbook <malay>ni</malay>
(err) [ah] best
it's interesting and <malay>dia kelakar</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay> just a nice balance of <malay>kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar</malay> more <malay>kelakar</malay> than <malay>sedih</malay>
best <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> episode <malay>dia yang</malay> one one and a half hours
<malay>lama</malay>
ya #wei#
<malay>ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa</malay> [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [dah]
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I'm used to watching (um) english
english <malay>punya</malay> series english <malay>punya</malay> series <malay>paling lama pun</malay> like forty minutes [jer]
and then <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> [lah] twenty minutes twenty minutes [jer]
you know what I grew up on was (um) how I met your mother
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot <malay>tapi macam tak bercakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references <malay>macam</malay> inside jokes
<malay>pastu</malay>
ya [dah] you know <malay>masa tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia kat dalam dia kat</malay> channel hallmark
<malay>kot</malay>
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode <malay>baru</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> my mum was (um) was very strict with this about bed times [ah] usually <malay>macam</malay> ten <malay>tu</malay> we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister [lah] my oldest sister <malay>kitaorang akan</malay> sneak out <malay>untuk tengok</malay>
<malay>pastu kalau</malay>
I don't know [ah] sometimes <malay>dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar</malay> [jer]
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know <malay>biar</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
let us get away because sometimes <malay>kita kena belajar</malay> [lah] to be
you know have to break the rules
especially because <malay>kitaorang</malay> [kan] <malay>ramai</malay> there's like six of us
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
[ah] <malay>benda macam ni</malay> is like a small thing let it go [lah]
I used to <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] my sister and I would break (um) bed time
a lot <malay>sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok</malay>
<malay>baca buku yang</malay> I don't know time at first it was <malay>bagus</malay> you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot <malay>kalau kitaorang pergi</malay> big bad wolf or sale <malay>yang</malay> like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to <malay>simpan</malay> and then the worst part is that we have books <malay>yang</malay> we haven't read but we want to buy new
<malay>tapi</malay>
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] <malay>sampai sekarang tak baca</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> my mom [dah] <malay>simpan semua buku dekat</malay> my grandma's house <malay>punya</malay> store so <malay>kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam</malay> store <malay>tu</malay> but I read books on my phone now
exactly you just download the the book the E book
#wei# <malay>kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek</malay>

[ah] so
[ah] and then he's nice I mean we argue a lot <malay>tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja</malay> [jer] because I think we have the same like almost similar personality

[ah] so for me
no kids (uh) but I was (uh) raising <malay> itu my nephews my nieces [kan] from the time they were young [lah] (um) partly because for (err) me (err) usually [lah] I'm not around in singapore <malay> pasal
I was studying away [kan] abroad then after that when I was working also (um) I was living abroad most of the time <malay> pasal kena posting
so <malay> selalunye not here so when I'm back usually

(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
<malay> tapi apart from <malay> macam bonus <malay> macam grade [kan] I mean <malay> takde apa-apa macam incentive <malay> ke or
[ah]
ya
ya
ya
(uh) is just to put [ah] <malay> betul [lah]
actually [ah] your
ya actually [ah] your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend [lah] <malay> pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu [kan] one of my friend so he was
(uh) like you accountant also (err) so actually <malay> yang hantar dia so went to <malay> belajar lepas how many years [ah] three years ya three years <malay> lepas tu balik [lah] <malay> balik then of course serve the bond [lah]
serve the bond buat accounting [kan] and like you [lah] also quite good at it <malay> dia punya bond <malay> berapa [eh] <malay> enam tahun masa tu
if I'm not wrong
(uh) (uh) for accounting
not too bad <malay> pasal pun for them <malay> dorang habiskan <malay> dulu baru pergi unlike me [lah] <malay> pasal for me [kan] disrupt (uh)
then [ah] then <malay> pergi luar lepas tu [ah] <malay> balik you see so
(err) <malay> ye [lah] for
for me a bit different so <malay> lepas tu my friend <malay> balik as usual [lah] <malay> kita [kan]
keep in touch
you know especially when <malay> biasa [lah] [kan] <malay> ada baby then baby shower
<malay> lepas tu keep up <malay> lepas tu kaya-kaya then <malay> macam every <malay> dua tiga bulan you know [eh] fed up [lah] let's go have <malay> teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue [kan] suddenly he said
[eh] I'm leaving [ah] my job

(err) I think that's just tip of the iceberg [lah] <malay> pasal masa period gini [kan] <malay> kena buat banyak [lah] I think the most important yang <malay> dorang kena buat triage <malay> macam
<malay> semua bila datang tu [kan] [ah] <malay> nanti is (uh) people like my friend and his team [lah] then they check and then they ask them [eh] you look familiar [ah] because after a while [ah]
they keep coming back <malay> tahu because now they know what to do like [oh] my back pain (uh) <malay> dapat [oh] I feeling
a bit fever [kan] and a lot of them now get full medical check up
[kan] <malay> pasal when you tell them (ugh) my chest (ugh) cannot breath sir (ugh) (ugh) (ugh) [ah] then you cannot take the risk [kan]
so my friend after a while !wah! <malay> boleh kenal muka tahu
so he will tell them [eh] you look familiar didn't I see you one month ago your over [ah]
!huh! but it's tough [lah]
because the shift work [eh]
I mean basically (err) you don't have enough people [lah]
I mean that [one] for sure [lah] it must be twenty four hours <malay> pasal you just never know when this virus will strike [kan] [ah] so <malay> sebab itu susah [eh] for your job <malay> yang last time <malay> tu so you say you cover asia pac <malay> selalunye which countries [ah]
[oh] indonesia (mm)
[ah]

[kan] (um) <malay> macam gitu [ah] but back then [ah]

got a lot of things to do [kan]
within say three days you are in one country [ah] !wah! you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast [kan]
so from that time [ah] you know <malay> sampai ke malam [ah] then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work [kan]
so [ah] it's fun [ah] especially when you're twenty something [kan] <malay> penat pun penat [lah] of course but you know it's fun get to see the world [ah] by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone [ah] I'm different era
(uh) no distraction but also [kan]
you must understand [ah] so much harder I mean <malay> dulu

of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
twinx the magical fairy <malay> ini semua [kan] that that was I went through the whole cycle
[kan] then you have to be always referee [kan] <malay> nanti (uh) <malay> yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband <malay> lepas tu adiknya abang I want to watch something else <malay> abang [ah] then you have to be referee [kan] then when the cousin <malay> semua datang [ha] <malay> lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>kalang kabut
then you know [lah] I'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
on (uh) handphone or tablet or whatever you see ya I bucked the trend long ago I always tell them <malay>kalau nak tengok semua</malay> share okay
[ah] good for you [ah]
[ah] <malay> macam Panadol you know
I think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but I think you are absolutely right <malay> macam mana pun [kan] I mean cannot [lah] you know when ipad first started [kan] I realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put [kan] <malay> dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know I started seeing that very quickly you see so
<malay> macam kenapa [lah] you know maybe [lah] you call me jurassic [eh] <malay> pasal I'm conservative about this thing [kan] <malay> macam !huh! why is your baby looking at Youtube [lah] and this and that [kan] to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry <malay> pasal dia punya lung
get exercise <malay> tahu
<malay> cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor [lah] you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying <malay> pasal babies are
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you [kan]
father of four [kan] you <malay> tahu [lah] [kan] <malay> budak-budak ni semua <malay> bila nangis then you <malay> kasi attention <malay> sikit aja semua okay
but I don't understand [ah] this parents [kan]
[ah] there must be other horror stories you see [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
exactly exactly [ah] <malay> sama [lah]
no <malay> pasal you <malay> pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family <malay> keluar [kan]
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me [lah] [eh] you know is quite disturbing [lah] no you go and see especially pre COVID when families can go out [kan] then you see [eh] father mother two kids maybe [ah] maybe got maid [lah] [eh] doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like [eh]
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your Instagram your work mail your Whatsapp so what's the point [ah] [oh] my friends <malay> semua marah if I
say things like that you know [ah] <malay> kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so <malay> macam no [lah] you don't understand so I will said so what is it that I don't understand I live on the same planet way I have the same family structures [what]
right so what
<malay>kenapa</malay> I don't <malay>tak faham apa-apa</malay> you know say you know I don't understand you know these kids [ah]
said [oh] basically you can't be bothered [lah] you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
said <malay> biasa [lah]
[eh] let's face it [lah] you know even we as teenagers [ah] last time [kan] remember when your mother <malay> tanya score <malay> macam mana [ah] okay [lah]
[kan] despite the fact that you had two fights that day
lost your homework <malay> kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay [lah] nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
[ah] tease out [kan] bit by bit and find out <malay> semua [kan] all these kinds of things [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
(mm)
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
no I think until you basically die I always remind people <malay> pun [kan] you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them [ah] you are still [ah]
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something I always remind
people over and over again [lah] [kan] <malay> pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off <malay> macam even <malay> lepas I <malay> hantar last time [lah] [eh] my <malay> anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then I go to work
afternoon I check in [what]
although <malay> ada maid ada <malay> dia punya you know grandmother <malay> kat rumah [kan]
but I will just check in okay everything okay you know came back K do homework or not are you know check check check right then when you come home is the same [lah] you know A you know tomorrow got what [ah] got not you know got this now whatever
it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say [lah] you know you cannot okay for two hours I cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no [lah] nothing to do with that
nothing
but I don't think it's it's just you I think (uh) there are still a small but good number of people <malay>yang macam</malay> you and that's good <malay> tahu pasal
would to be honest I was teaching for about <malay> setahun gitu for one
right cause I was an adjunct I was an adjunct lecturer then I saw the kind of (err) students that we have these days
even the good [ones] honestly [ah]
when you
you know take some time talk to them [kan] <malay> tanya-tanya macam mana [kan] then you realize actually they are quite neglected
(err) by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning [ah] is the maid
(mm) <malay> tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know <malay> macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them <malay> macam manja-manja dengan teacher <malay> pasal macam
that is their their parental figure
[dah] [lah] <malay> every day pergi sekolah [kan] and even during COVID and home based learning [kan] they see the teacher still online [kan] <malay> pasal
you are looking at the laptop [kan] and what not ya and although parents now K [lah] belatedly realised !hey! you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
but I can tell you also when we went into phase two [kan] !wah! <malay> budak-budak semua balik sekolah [kan]
no more home based learning for many schools [kan] !wah! most parents hurrah hurrah <malay> pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out !wah!

to them one of I mean you all look the same you know you know all this (uh) (uh) ya
English people so I'll just borrow someone's (uh) membership
card
and then watch the weekend game or something [lah] you know and my time don't forget because this is (uh) nineteen ninety [eh]
there's no man U wasn't big name
you know
ya it was like you know man city you know (um)
liverpool everton newcastle (um) all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian [ah] [kan] you know they track track [kan]
so we go and we go <malay> bukan (uh) division one <malay> aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for <malay> yang macam
secondly thirdly [kan]
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
<malay> pasal takde big name <malay> takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
so that was (uh) always a lot of fun [lah] you know when I was also a student [ah]
then fast forward when you mention paris [kan] I actually (uh) live there two thousand four two thousand eight
(mm) (mm) (mm) I was posted to paris <malay> tapi from paris I also cover (uh) three other countries [lah] I'm based in paris but I also cover spain portugal and another country so <malay> empat
country [lah] <malay> yang kena jaga so for me [ah] when people come usual [lah] you know then they'll want to go to euro Disney and then don't forget [ah] I was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
not the duty free but the premium outlet
[ah] <malay> pasal
[ah] because that [one] is one stop
[oh]
euro Disney you see
[ah]
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet [lah]
and <malay> kalau pergi london <malay> tu just outside <malay> selalu ni all this (uh)
housewives all these <malay> makcik-makcik will want to buy the Wedgwood
[ah] dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
[ah] <malay> dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore I mean wherever you are in the world [lah] so !wah! #shiok# you know so I was in paris (uh) two zero four to eight so <malay> empat tahun [ah] <malay> kat situ
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) I live (err) I lived in (err)
(err) the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
(err)
quarter [lah] they call it [ah] so I'm literally halfway between #champs elysees# the arc of #triomphe# to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night [kan]
<malay> nanti nampak yang that <malay> lampu tu [lah] [kan] <malay> dia macam lighthouse [kan] every night [ah] [ah] so I'll see that light [lah]
circling circling
so I lived in the really the central part [ah]
[oh] so easy for me pasal I just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite (uh) good
(mm) [ah] that's the #gare du nord# (mm) (mm) (mm)
the museum [ah] [ah]
[eh] <malay> penat juga budak-budak
[ah]
<malay> naik stroller [lah] two of them
[ah]
actually #gare du nord# when you <malay> keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal <malay> banyak kebab <malay> banyak yang #maghrebian# <malay> nya [kan] <malay> yang daripada morocco <malay> daripada daripada mana [eh] (uh)
ya [lah] (mm) the #maghreb# areas [lah] (mm) morocco algeria you know those kind of places
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
they they call it #bateaux mouches# the flyboat
[ah] <malay> ada dua option satu you just <malay> naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
[ah] [ah]
burn down [ah]
so you saw when it was still
[oh]
no it's actually [eh] really really
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down <malay> pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's <malay> macam symbol [lah] paris [kan] so <malay> bila
[ah]
<malay> bukan sabotage <malay> bukan ada terrorism
[ah] sebab itu [lah]
<malay> sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat <malay> ni semua dorang touring [kan] it's really really
!wow! you know it's really inspiring you see
ya and I do miss (uh) living there <malay> pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world [lah] you know without a doubt [lah] you know
ya
paris [eh] <malay> memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london <malay> macam K [lah] you can walk a bit a bit [lah] <malay> tapi after a while <malay> macam
[ah] boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and <malay> macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery [kan]
(mm)
correct correct
I agree
correct don't look down you know I always tell people when you're in paris [ah] look up you know ya
I mean once in a while
<malay> kena tengok bawah [lah] <malay> pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni [kan]
[ah] then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place [lah] you know so it's quite good to go
they got [lah] <malay> nanti after COVID
[ah]
after COVID even for me <malay> pun frankly [lah] [eh] <malay> lepas I came back two thousand eight
after that I rarely go out anymore [lah] <malay> pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly <malay> dekat singapore [lah]
<malay> tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice [lah] <malay> pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my <malay> mak [kan] seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me I don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend [ah] <malay> masuk #johor# [lah]
(mm)
(mm) and also <malay> pun !aiya! you know <malay> boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids [kan] like I've got even (uh) grand nephews grand nieces [kan] <malay> yang dekat malaysia then its easy to (uh) go to
Legoland [kan] <malay> pergi makan-makan
relax relax you know so quite fun [lah]
you know (uh)
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen [ah] I suspect will probably
only be able to travel [kan] pergi #johor# and whatever <malay> sebelum kita boleh really go out there again [lah]
know <malay> dekat-dekat [lah] you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know (um) <malay> pasal every day before COVID [kan] between two hundred to three hundred thousand [eh] <malay> dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu [kan] <malay> bukannye satu dua ribu [kan]
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know [lah]
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right <malay> pasal apa dia punya
<malay> penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
[ah]
paradigm paradigm (mm)
(uh) paradigm about two years about two years [ah]
(mm)
ya ya [ah]
obviously [lah] but also don't forget catered also for the #johorians# who work here <malay> pasal
the ones who are here most of them will open up a account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in you know this [lah] pasal you know they don't you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks [kan] so
[ah] even for your maid you know today anyway [lah] [eh] these days
as soon as you hire one [kan] then <malay> dorang buka [kan] payroll payroll <malay> nye tu [ah] so <malay> dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan Nets
[ah] <malay> dia by two [kan] when you go there <malay> sekarang some shops [lah] they definitely accept Nets which is good [lah] you know
<malay> pasal even for their workers [kan] <malay> lepas tu balik malaysia [lah] <malay> nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up</malay> [kan] <malay>nak tukar duit
[kan] when their salary is already in sing dollars so <malay> dorang !alah! pakai Nets aje [lah] <malay> lebih senang
<malay> tak susah
but you can tell [ah] <malay> macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites [kan] <malay> yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil Youtube ghost town <malay> betul [lah]
is really bad <malay> macam city square <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
(um) <malay> orang semua tengok !wah! really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully [lah] it'll be a slow and painful process [lah] but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not <malay> macam kita aje [kan] you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so <malay> macam gitu aje [lah]
[ah]
[ah] that's always good question <malay> tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me <malay> macam each one is so different [kan] so
but generally [lah] my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then I can just lose myself
you know ya <malay> pasal dulu pun when I was a student then you know [lah] budget pun <malay> bukannye banyak [kan] even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type <malay> macam
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
you know you just <malay> ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know <malay> macam you <malay> tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you <malay> tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of <malay> teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what I did [lah] you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd <malay> lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends [kan] [ah] so for me that's where it's quite you know
that that's more it [lah] you know
but I must say (um) not so much now [lah] but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me <malay> pasal that was my first posting I lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest <malay> yang dorang <malay> baru [jer] <malay> buka [kan] (err)
(err) not not easy [lah] to go in [kan] that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
<malay> orang asing you know so was a lot of fun [lah] you know and then after that even after I left I made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
see the developments but the changes [kan] since my time there and it's been what you know (uh) more than twenty years [kan] almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even I don't recognize it anymore
[ah] [ah] okay good we are one hour already
[ah] we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now

okay [orh]
ya for me today was okay [ah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
<malay>tadi</malay>
today today was my off day
and I got like three days off you know how I told you <malay>macam</malay> I
<malay>ada kira-kira</malay>
<malay>sepuluh hari lagi</malay> left
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
slowly slowly [ah] slowly <malay>gila</malay>
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit <malay>macam</malay>
a bit
<malay>apa tu senget</malay>
ya
ya a bit skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
the <malay>apa tu</malay> the
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [seh] <malay>kurang ajar gila</malay>
it's not it's <malay>tak</malay> compulsory <malay>tapi macam</malay>
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
[oh] that sucks
(mm) do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure #bo#
sure #bo#
[ah]
[eh] <malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak baca dulu sebelum</malay> you <malay>buat</malay> paper
!huh!

okay I think that was me in in <malay>apa tu</malay> in
secondary school also when <malay>kita buat</malay> lit
ya
then why you take
[ah] okay okay understand understand
okay <malay>jap</malay>
speedy <malay>ni</malay>
speedy <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini</malay> [tau] like everytime <malay>dia</malay>
everytime <malay>kita nak</malay> everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak cukup</malay> attention
<malay>tak cukup apa tak cukup</malay> attention <malay>kesian dia</malay>
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three shift correct
so <malay>dia baru</malay> join
so it like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
<malay>kena</malay>
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite <malay>rabak</malay> (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
<malay>nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>abeh nak mandi semua</malay>
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
so <malay>macam</malay> he was damn lost [ah]
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
my language classes then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>tak cakap apa-apa</malay> never say anything so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to this confirmed movement to because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to shift
in december
same timing
three to twelve
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty to twelve [eh] twelve thirty
then now it's like (err) three to twelve
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot <malay>paksa orang</malay> to
<malay>datang</malay> and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then <malay>macam</malay> it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I'm
my sleep is deprived
I have to really plan <malay>macam</malay> straight away after finish
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
<malay>pastu keluar lepak</malay> and then go straight to work <malay>atau</malay> sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
<malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>kerja</malay>
ya and because my shift <malay>pukul berapa pukul tiga</malay>
<malay>tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang</malay>
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no <malay>takde takde takde</malay>
no they <malay>dorang</malay> big fans of <malay>macam</malay> the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>maksud dia</malay>
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally <malay>lain punya</malay> client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
<malay>tiga ribu</malay>
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she she took chemistry in the <malay>pastu</malay> (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that I've been very complacent <malay>macam</malay> I've
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
not complacent <malay>macam terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>apa tu terlalu banyak</malay>
I don't know I I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] <malay>yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok</malay> the the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like
a clock report right every ten
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
<malay>abeh kita</malay> proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is <malay>betul</malay>
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> whether they
whether they <malay>apa tu</malay>
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because <malay>kita punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak ada nak kena</malay> #chope#
reserve
<malay>macam</malay> you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of <malay>macam mana kita kerja</malay>
okay so <malay>pukul tiga setengah</malay> I <malay>bangun</malay>
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say <malay>pukul lima</malay> we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because I'm the kind of person <malay>yang</malay> I cannot <malay>tunggu</malay> for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I'm not a <malay>apa tu</malay>
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember I told you there was like one time in between july <malay>sampai</malay>
september <malay>ke</malay> august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
<malay>pastu</malay>
jaded ya
just jaded like <malay>macam</malay>
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so <malay>dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat</malay>
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
<malay>orang ketiga</malay> [lah]
no
<malay>apa benda</malay> home wrecker
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
no I think <malay>dorang nak</malay> more natural conversation so that
this whatever can pick up
I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but I just
I don't know <malay>takut</malay> it's not because I don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay [lah] I think it is their job [lah]
[a'ah] [lah]

yes yes yes that [one] <malay>yang tu yang tu</malay>
(uh) can watch online if you want [eh] you want to watch today
ya
why
(mm)
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> or ask anyone I don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need <malay>macam</malay> to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right you're right <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
cute <malay>gila</malay> [oh] my god it's very cute
ya ya I <malay>dah</malay> wash <malay>lagi</malay> I <malay>dah basuh</malay>
I <malay>dah kering</malay>
I <malay>dah apa lagi</malay> (err) vocabulary <malay>boleh kasi dorang</malay>
I <malay>kering</malay> I <malay>dah</malay> squeeze dry
I <malay>dah</malay> compress <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
ya I <malay>dah</malay> I've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now <malay>tengah nak kering</malay> I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
<malay>bawa balik</malay> [ah] <malay>mana satu yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
I I I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
because it all looks so pretty <malay>semua lawa gila</malay>
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
<malay>dia macam</malay> those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie <malay>dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before <malay>berbual</malay>
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it when it's <malay>macam</malay> when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
I feel like when everybody watches it
dia <malay>macam</malay> it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream <malay>lebih</malay> mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merchandise <malay>nak beli nak beli apa lagi</malay>
<malay>nak beli</malay>
ya <malay>macam</malay> these merchandise <malay>nak beli baju</malay> you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> if you if it were another show for example <malay>macam</malay> Fruits Basket
<malay>atau</malay> I don't know what's another show I don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so <malay>macam</malay> that's why I say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
you <malay>tahu</malay> [kan] I <malay>ada</malay> classmate <malay>jepun</malay> in my korean class
so <malay>dia</malay>
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so <malay>macam</malay> most of us <malay>kita ambil sebab kita</malay> either
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
<malay>kita tengok dengar lagu</malay>
<malay>kita tengok cerita</malay> K drama <malay>dengar lagu</malay> K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so I asked her like [oh] how about ya so I asked her <malay>macam</malay>
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say <malay>macam</malay>
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
<malay>macam</malay> real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
the life in japan <malay>macam</malay> how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how <malay>dia kerja</malay> part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's it's I love this class because <malay>macam</malay>
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old <malay>punya</malay> remember I <malay>berbual pasal</malay>
cute <malay>gila</malay>
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like I like I talk to her about <malay>macam</malay> my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also <malay>macam</malay> in #jakarta# and how <malay>dia rindu</malay> [lah] <malay>rindu gila dengan</malay> #jakarta# <malay>tapi</malay> she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place <malay>paling</malay>
<malay>paling selamat</malay>
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
<malay>tak kat</malay> #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) <malay>dia macam</malay> I don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
[ah] I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
<malay>sampai tahap maksima</malay>
kidding
<malay>apa</malay>
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because <malay>dorang punya</malay> numbering is very <malay>susah gila</malay> it's like
<malay>dorang</malay> count [kan] <malay>dorang punya</malay> currency <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia <malay>sama juga</malay>
so <malay>nak kena</malay> you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
<malay>banyak fikir</malay> [ah] I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but <malay>macam</malay>
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to <malay>layan</malay> my korean I feel like I'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
<malay>lawa gila</malay> it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech

hello hi how are you I <malay>nak minta tolong sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh tak</malay>

I mean we are going there [lah] but you have a recommendation where
I think I think I know I think I know <malay>yang mana satu</malay> we ever seen that place before but don't think I've tried <malay>sana sedap</malay> [eh]
[oh] is that type [lah] I mean you have to queue and buy you don't have no need to make reservation all that <malay>kena</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah</malay> [eh]
[oh] <malay>sebelas</malay> this is for lunch [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>nasi padang</malay> I think the most of the places <malay>jarang</malay> [ah] [eh] I think but there's one place I don't know you <malay>pernah pergi ke tak dekat-dekat sana juga apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nama dia</malay> I think it's called <malay>sari ratu</malay> you <malay>pernah pergi sana buka</malay> I think like <malay>pukul sembilan malam pun dia masih buka</malay> [tau]
I actually have no idea but I <malay>pernah pergi makan sana pukul sembilan malam gitu</malay>
<malay>dia punya lauk masih</malay> still looks fresh [lah] <malay>tak tak rasa macam</malay>
since <malay>pagi ke apa</malay> maybe <malay>dia orang masak petang juga</malay> but okay [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> in case you <malay>keluar dengan</malay> your family or your friends
<malay>tekak</malay> you <malay>nak makan nasi padang</malay> you don't know where to go ya it's it's I think they have a few other outlets but the one I went to was I forgot the name of the road [lah] but it's it's quite near the #kampong glam# area like #baghdad# street or something like that
[oh]
[oh] <malay>apa nama tempat dia</malay> [eh]
[oh]
ya I think the the mall itself is a expensive mall <malay>kalau pergi sana</malay> I think
okay [lah] I think I will try that that what <malay>minang</malay> place there
(mm)
ya then that's the plan think I'm bringing (err) my parents <malay>dia orang nak makan sana</malay> cause just nice [lah] think after that I <malay>boleh ke nak jalan</malay> around the area <malay>beli kain-kain ke apa-apa</malay>
that that area got a lot of <malay>kedai-kedai macam gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>jual kain</malay> [lah] <malay>jual buku-buku</malay> [lah] <malay>jual baju</malay> [lah] carpet [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>belum ada</malay> plan but around that area got a few malls [kan]
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
for the house I don't know like <malay>pinggan mangkuk ke apa</malay> think whatever ya [lah]
<malay>dia orang nak beli</malay> I think <malay>nak beli macam periuk-periuk tempat masak</malay> I think can bring to think #bugis# junction quite near
(mm) or any of the malls around there [lah]
ya
ya [lah] I think everywhere [lah] the same but now if possible <malay>duduk rumah</malay> more ya cause if you have to go out also <malay>yang</malay> no choice then <malay>kalau nak keluar</malay> you buy whatever you need to buy you <malay>beli dah beli dah makan ke apa</malay> then <malay>terus balik</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak merayap pergi mana-mana sekarang makin</malay>
how to say that frustrating like you said [lah] take out handphone take take the
code sometimes you take the code also still need to queue <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> and go there go to the shop for less than five minutes
true I think now <malay>banyak orang buat gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi kadang-kadang barang macam baju ke apa</malay> you <malay>nak beli kadang-kadang</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> online you <malay>tengok</malay> colour <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>nanti datang</malay> colour <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kita kita boleh hantar balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang boleh</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> refund <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! ya [lah] and <malay>gambar</malay> you <malay>tak boleh</malay> cannot
trust <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
(mm)
then in the end what happened did you <malay>makan</malay> the <malay>nasi</malay> [jer]
[oh]
I think I think got <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] I <malay>dengar</malay> complain for me that time I order but I didn't I didn't I didn't order for delivery I think I order for sometimes you can order
<malay>untuk</malay> self pick up you know you order then you <malay>pergi sana sendiri</malay> you you you
you pick up the food <malay>sendiri</malay> then I order at first they say the food should be ready <malay>dua puluh minit</malay> then I [dah] <malay>sampai sana</malay> I <malay>tunggu</malay> almost one hour <malay>baru</malay> the food <malay>siap</malay>
that time (mm) ya
ya [lah] that one is
that one <malay>lagi</malay> self pick up <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>tunggu dia</malay> delivery I think <malay>mungkin</malay> more than one hour but this was back then [lah] during the time time circuit circuit breaker
think nobody nobody nobody can say they never order grab during that time I think <malay>semua orang</malay> order
<malay>pernah</malay> order grab <malay>takkan hari-hari masak kat rumah</malay> [kan]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak makan kat luar kedai pun tutup</malay> then <malay>bila</malay> order <malay>tunggu satu jam</malay> ya [lah] that time I I <malay>ada satu</malay> friend <malay>pun dia ceritakan dia</malay> order I think (err) mothers' day I think
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> order <malay>pun dia</malay> order (err)
<malay>dia dah</malay> order <malay>tunggu lama-lama</malay> the <malay>punya</malay> app <malay>cakap</malay> waiting for driver <malay>nak dekat dua puluh</malay> minute in the end <malay>tak ada dia dah</malay> order order order <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu dia cakap</malay> cancel <malay>dah tunggu</malay> twenty minutes (uh huh)
[ah] mothers' day [tau] I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
day <malay>ada orang dah</malay> advance order the day before to arrive for example [eh] <malay>dia cakap</malay> you order for today <malay>esok dia suruh</malay> deliver for <malay>makan tengah hari</malay>
<malay>pukul dua belas</malay> [ah] on the next day [lah] they advance order [lah] then when it comes on the day half an hour before <malay>dia orang</malay> cancel <malay>dia punya</malay> order
<malay>orang orang nak buat</malay> celebration <malay>dia orang buat macam gini tu</malay> [lah]
ya [lah] but the the the the grab driver sometimes it's not their fault [lah] it's all the the the the restaurants <malay>kadang-kadang dia orang pergi sana</malay> then restaurant <malay>yang cakap</malay> cancel but <malay>dia orang tak</malay> fair [lah] then the driver the rider <malay>kena marah</malay>
(mm)
I think maybe for safety <malay>juga</malay> [lah] I think <malay>kalau satu</malay> not not <malay>dia orang punya tanggungjawab kalau dia orang pergi</malay> check and then the the let's say the deliver deliver <malay>lepas tu orang tu cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dalam</malay> [eh] inside my my packet got
for example [lah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> I see hair then they complain <malay>kat</malay> restaurant <malay>nanti</malay> restaurant will <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] but the rider just now got check your food so maybe the hair come from them
I think the restaurant <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang yang</malay> pack <malay>makanan</malay> so they have to make sure everything is there cause the delivery the grab delivery guy <malay>kerja dia</malay> is just to send so <malay>kalau</malay>
that one I not too sure [lah] but you know they earn also not much
ya
ya ya [lah] you can see <malay>tengok kadang-kadang dia orang hujan ke panas pun dia orang dia orang</malay> still delivering
ya but what to do ya but I think got one time I heard (err) I got one friend <malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>satu</malay> (err) whenever <malay>dia</malay> order
(err) I think her mum [lah] her mum surely will will
<malay>kasih dia orang</malay> tip <malay>kasih</malay> cash ya [lah] but sometimes [a'ah] <malay>dia kasih</malay> extra like maybe two dollar <malay>ke lima</malay> dollar
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I think so but I think maybe
maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> order often so maybe once in a while they order then ya [lah] but good [lah] then these people they they they don't ask they don't earn a lot [what] <malay>kalau dapat</malay> tip and not say
<malay>kerja dia orang senang</malay> ya [lah] <malay>senang</malay> as in <malay>cuma ambil makanan hantar makanan tapi kadang-kadang nak kena layan yang</malay> customer complain [lah] customer <malay>marah</malay> so I think once in a while <malay>ada orang</malay>
<malay>kasih</malay> tip <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>kasih dorang macam</malay> motivate <malay>dia orang</malay> [lah] at least <malay>ada juga orang yang</malay>
<malay>baik hati kalau tak asyik kena marah</malay> [jer]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap cakap pasal gitu kalau nasi padang dia orang ada</malay> deliver [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>cari semua tak ada</malay>
<malay>tapi nasi ambeng ada</malay> deliver <malay>tapi nasi padang</malay> I think <malay>tak ada</malay>
(uh) [oh]
<malay>kesian</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak ada</malay> offered to refund <malay>ke apa-apa</malay> that's not good actually
cannot [lah] the customer <malay>dia orang bayar apa</malay>
ya [lah] if you pay then I think cannot [lah] I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
so <malay>nanti esok</malay> you <malay>nak ikut tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> cycling (mm)
I think <malay>kita dah</malay> quite long time <malay>kita tak pergi</malay> #changi# beach [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] we go <malay>kita pergi</malay> early [lah] morning you know I mean by by <malay>tengah hari</malay> we should be done then can can go back
for lunch ya [lah] this quite some time I <malay>pun dah lama tak tak</malay> ride my bicycle
you <malay>punya</malay> bicycle <malay>masih ada tak</malay> then okay [lah] is it the same one that you <malay>beli dulu</malay>
cause recently I think that day I I I <malay>ada beli</malay> I went to the bicycle shop [lah] to change to buy new helmet cause my helmet <malay>dah dah koyak dia punya</malay> strap I was talking to the owner of the shop <malay>dia cakap sekarang</malay> like everyday <malay>dia jual</malay> like maybe
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
I think so cause that time <malay>dia orang tak boleh</malay>
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
wherever [lah] <malay>tak boleh pergi makan luar tak boleh pergi tengok wayang</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> shopping [lah]
I think <malay>dia baru baru buka</malay> [lah] !aiya! maybe I don't know <malay>tak tahu</malay> [eh]
maybe [lah] I think they they the the new movies I think maybe <malay>kalau rasa</malay>
you <malay>rasa kalau dia orang keluar pun sekarang mungkin tak siapa yang nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay> maybe they wait [lah] they wait until maybe the the cinema allow
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full [lah] I think if they full also it'll be
ya there's no <malay>apa</malay>
safe safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya [lor] but if ya [lah] okay [lah] if you okay
<malay>esok esok kita pergi</malay> to #changi# after that after that <malay>kita pergi makan nasi lemak nak</malay> (mm)
okay <malay>kita pergi</malay> the famous one [lah] <malay>kat sana yang</malay> #changi#
famous
I think the I don't know I think maybe the <malay>sambal</malay> [lah] okay the rest of the outlet should be the same
basic
three dollars [lah] then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that [lah] but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
<malay>esok kita boleh</malay> try [lah] <malay>kalau kalau kalau makcik</malay>
<malay>beli</malay> I <malay>senyum kalau pakcik</malay> then you <malay>senyum</malay> okay think just nice [lah] so we go cycling then go <malay>nasi lemak</malay> ya then after that we head back
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tu dah macam yang kat</malay> #bangkok# <malay>kadang-kadang boleh panas</malay>
<malay>abeh orang boleh pengsan gitu</malay> ya
I think <malay>dia punya macam</malay>
ya [lah] I think <malay>dia punya mungkin</malay> usually like that <malay>dia punya dia punya</malay> what you call that <malay>dia punya longkang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> drainage <malay>sumbat</malay> of course [lah] then <malay>kalau dia punya</malay> rain was like that day
I think the rain was
<malay>pagi sampai petang</malay> what six seven hours ya [lah]
if the rain that much then the drain <malay>sumbat mana air nak pergi</malay>
[oh]
ya [lah] <malay>tu nanti kalau dia orang ada rumah yang</malay> those landed property
you stay there ya [lah] will damage all the property [lah]
okay [lah] but this kind of weather I think <malay>susah nak</malay> predict <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok panas kadang-kadang pagi hujan</malay> or the other way that day <malay>pagi hujan lebat</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> stop
<malay>terus panas terik</malay>
I think <malay>dia orang</malay> also just <malay>tikam</malay> [jer] [lah]
they just guess maybe
maybe it's the other side maybe you <malay>kat</malay> east side #tampines# maybe <malay>kat</malay> #choa chu kang# <malay>ke</malay> #jurong# <malay>yang hujan</malay> right (mm) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like like that [what] not the whole singapore
(uh) [oh] <malay>kesiannya</malay> then
ya
confirm [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
[orh]
(mm) (mm) that means ya [lah] <malay>lama</malay> [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] but (mm)
I think most of the the what you call it <malay>apa dia panggil</malay> dengue hot spot [eh] <malay>dah banyak dulu</malay> I think <malay>tak banyak tempat</malay> I think near my place also <malay>kat</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>ada</malay> there there there's (err)
one case opposite my block (mm) ya but sometimes when you hear this kind of thing then you you you worry what so that time when when my my mum <malay>dengar</malay> then <malay>terus dia pergi luar dia</malay> check <malay>dia punya pasu-pasu bunga</malay> make sure <malay>tak ada</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> the officers <malay>datang</malay>
they can summon you [kan] I think ya so <malay>kalau</malay> you have like <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I think they come random [lah] it's either that or either that or I don't know [eh] <malay>mungkin kalau ada</malay> neighbour <malay>yang</malay> complain <malay>tak tahu kalau</malay> the neighbours suspect you you <malay>tak</malay>
maybe [lah] maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> they they take I think I'm just guessing maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> take like a a sample
of the water something like <malay>dia orang bawa</malay>
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> lab <malay>agaknya dia orang</malay> check I don't know cause if not
they they won't see what I think need like at least like a magnifying glass or like a microscope so maybe they bring back [lah] they take some sample of the <malay>air bawa balik</malay> to lab then run <malay>dia orang</malay> test <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] but ya [lah] sometimes they will check [what] even if they cannot see <malay>kalau dia orang tengok</malay> let's say <malay>rumah</malay> you
<malay>ada ada</malay> plants <malay>ada</malay> potted plants then <malay>dia punya air dia tengok</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tak tukar</malay> they will <malay>tanya apa nanti dia orang tanya dia punya air</malay> do you change everyday because by right you <malay>kena tukar</malay> so at least if
happen to be the <malay>nyamuk bertelur kat situ kalau</malay> you <malay>tukar hari-hari</malay>
then <malay>dapat dapat</malay>
but you you get to <malay>buang dia punya telur apa</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> let's say you
<malay>tak tukar</malay> I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> I <malay>pernah baca</malay> I don't know [lah] maybe takes a few days [lah] maybe like four to five days for the whole process for the <malay>nyamuk</malay>
<malay>telur</malay> to <malay>tukar</malay> [lah] so <malay>kalau</malay> you leave it for that long then maybe you might <malay>kena</malay> summon [lah] <malay>kalau dia</malay> check so that time my my mum <malay>dengar dia terus</malay> check
ya [lah] <malay>kat rumah pun semua tukar</malay> at least everyday [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah] the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that [lah]
ya [lah] so <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> ya [lah] because the the like what's the
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
the way cause I read on online the way to differentiate they say this mosquito <malay>dia punya kaki tu ada ada belang-belang ada belang-belang</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kena gigit pun</malay> (mm)
so I think if you if you <malay>rasa macam</malay> you <malay>kena gigit dengan</malay> mosquito I think you just
or you just monitor [lor] <malay>dia punya</malay> mosquito is not the aedes mosquito you you won't have fever what if after you get bitten then <malay>dua tiga hari lepas tu</malay> you <malay>demam</malay> I think better go doctor you check
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>tak ada dia</malay>
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
(mm) then that one can can can lead to complications [lah] <malay>kalau tak kalau biasa punya</malay> after some time it will it will get better ya [lah] but <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] you know means you you if you get bitten by the aedes mosquito then you <malay>kena</malay> dengue
ya so how to prevent
then you cannot see [what] <malay>kalau dia nak gigit</malay> you <malay>dia pun tak tak</malay> warning
ya
the the numbers just recently I think I think india in one day <malay>dia punya</malay> the number of cases for COVID [lah] was like six almost sixty thousand just one day
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still I think and brazil and then india ya [lah] but
these countries I guess because <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
ya then some of them might not be even <malay>kat</malay> hospital you know
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high [lah] okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya ya [lah] because the that time when they they they were checking on the dormitories I think all the foreign workers <malay>tak boleh kerja</malay> [kan]
ya I know ya
(uh) (uh) maybe ya
ya I think so
ya [lah] but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
<malay>semua orang</malay> first time <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> ya but
not only the construction [lah] I think when the
foreign workers was was told to quarantine [eh] quarantine themselves <malay>duduk kat dalam</malay> dormitory <malay>tu kalau</malay> I <malay>tak tahu rumah</malay> you you <malay>tengok rumput-rumput pun tak ada orang potong macam dah macam hutan kat</malay> my office <malay>pun sama dia punya</malay>
<malay>pokok-pokok dia punya daun semua dah</malay>
<malay>dah tak terjaga</malay> ya [lah] that shows
so ya [lah] you can see that actually
the foreign workers are important only time time <malay>macam gini</malay> then people realise [oh] ya ya [lah] this during this difficult
period you <malay>boleh tengok macam orang yang</malay> what you call that essential essential workers you can tell like <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>tadi kita</malay> complain <malay>pasal</malay> grab food driver and all that ya <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine <malay>kalau dia orang tak ada</malay> that time circuit breaker you <malay>nak makan macam mana</malay>
ya [lah] some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya [lah] if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
we wait for the food one hour it might be even worse without them maybe you order morning your lunch <malay>baru dapat</malay>
[kan] nowadays (mm)
and all these foreign workers now then you notice that without them nobody <malay>bersihkan</malay> know your around your area under your block all that
(mm)
true ya (mm)
ya once in awhile [jer] [lah]
ya [lah] but <malay>tempat</malay> your workplace how you still going to work or
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
when that day I think I was at the area [lah] raffles down there [lah] you can see I was there lunch time <malay>macam tak ada orang</malay> (mm) can see that there is definitely different [lah] you see the lunch time crowd <malay>macam</malay> more like a ghost town I would say
ya [lor] but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay [lah] ya [lah] okay [lah] if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
including my my <malay>tempat kerja pun</malay> I think in ya I think in future maybe this is what I I I I guess would happen [lah] sooner or later most offices also would wouldn't be might be might be smaller you know
cause you realise that most of the employees also don't need to be in office cause <malay>sekarang dah berapa tiga</malay> [eh] <malay>dah tiga</malay> since march <malay>dah lima bulan dah</malay>
most of the most of the business
working from home still <malay>masih</malay> survive <malay>apa</malay> so why do they need to like rent office <malay>mahal-mahal duduk kat rumah pun tetap</malay> business <malay>jalan</malay>
true
ya
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kat rumah pun</malay> at least you save transport right if ya [lah] our train here not expensive but if you talk about one month how much maybe
two to three hundred on transport food
(mmhmm)
maybe the only thing <malay>yang</malay> you spend more I <malay>rasa mungkin</malay> is just your utilities [lor]
[kan] <malay>bila</malay> at home
whenever you on the fan [lah] you on your laptop cause usually
ya
if not usually you are at home <malay>malam-malam</malay> and weekend but now it's like twenty four seven <malay>hari-hari</malay>
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya [lah] but funny
because <malay>bila dulu</malay> time <malay>sebelum</malay> all these <malay>terjadi orang semua nak keluar</malay> so <malay>sekarang dah gini semua takut semua nak duduk rumah</malay>
[a'ah]
ya <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang nak pergi</malay>
airline <malay>pun</malay> even the airline <malay>nak pergi pun</malay> the the the I think the government doesn't allow
ya I mean like once in a while
<malay>kat</malay> singapore if you boring also I think singapore even though <malay>kecil</malay> still got a lot of places if you want to explore
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe (err) get people to stay home more
give them more things to do if all the businesses <malay>tak buat macam gini orang boleh jadi gila tak ada benda nak buat</malay>
<malay>takkan nak tengok</malay> [jer] [eh] but everything
ya I think like <malay>hari-hari dia orang boleh tengok semua habis nak buat apa</malay>
ya <malay>kalau tak</malay> it's not like <malay>kita</malay>
we said what the <malay>wayang orang nak tengok wayang pun</malay> the cinemas <malay>belum buka</malay> so
ya but not
a lot of shows right like if if if they have those new <malay>macam wayang</malay> I mean <malay>filem-filem yang baru mungkin</malay> more people will will go <malay>kalau tak ada orang</malay> not interested ya [lah] at least they have entertainment at home or more
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya [lah] like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
your ya but I think no choice [lah] <malay>sekarang semua kena gitu</malay>
ya like <malay>dulu pun macam apa tu</malay> during <malay>bulan puasa orang nak bayar</malay> what you call that the <malay>zakat fitrah</malay> ya but now also everything online [what] <malay>dulu</malay> people would queue at the
<malay>masjid</malay> you know (mm) even
the <malay>yang baru lepas hari raya haji korban</malay> also not allowed then some people just do overseas then they will just maybe take video or whatever then send all all consider now digital human no more face to face
ya
ya
okay
ya [lah]
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the [kan] they do everything at around your what you call that
(mmhmm)
ya I think all the woodlands #jurong# I think they were I forgot I think <malay>tak salah</malay> I <malay>ada sepuluh</malay> ya ten different places where they have the celebration [lah] ya
ya
ya <malay>kalau dia orang buat dekat</malay> the same place then more people will go there [what] so I think they have to [lah] to to <malay>elakkan orang</malay> go to like the #padang# or marina marina floating platform all that so
they just do at their own neighborhood so people <malay>tak akan</malay> you know <malay>berkumpul</malay> at the <malay>tempat</malay> which is better [lah] everything [lah] like (err) I think in other countries also you the this year I think the olympics are suppose to happen
postpone postpone next year
ya [lah] cannot [lah] some more <malay>lagi</malay> that kind of event I think you're talking about
ya millions of people [lah]
okay [lah] but better [lah] like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
(err) can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
saw got people post <malay>gambar-gambar yang</malay> the river singapore river [lah] the some of the beaches the sea looks
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing [lah] it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they (err) those india and china those populated countries who have like (err) haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
nobody driving around ya their air cleared so <malay>tak ada macam berasap-asap lagi</malay> and then <malay>kita kat sini</malay> I mean we don't experience that that [lah] but for me personally I <malay>tengok bila</malay> during circuit breaker <malay>tak banyak kereta</malay> you can see like you said <malay>bila kita pergi</malay> jogging <malay>kat luar ke apa macam</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> fresh <malay>dia punya</malay> air <malay>tak macam dulu tak bau asap kereta</malay> right ya so I think ya everybody complain complain complain there is good also [lah] that come out of this people realise like you say just now people don't need to shop a lot
(mm) you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
<malay>apa yang yang</malay> I <malay>nak cakap</malay> you <malay>tak payah</malay> spend so much you know to to actually to to enjoy yourself to keep yourself happy ya just do the simple things
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive [what] you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this (err) COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake [lah] ya suddenly ya cause I got
some friends also they start you know some some of them do business [lah] like they bake and then sell some of them for themselves [lah] but at least it gives you time to to to learn something new you so you <malay>ada</malay> whatever [lah]
hobby <malay>baru ke apa ada yang masak ada yang boleh tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh]
<malay>main gitar bernyanyi</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>kalau</malay> if this thing didn't happen you you'd <malay>takkan tahu yang</malay> all this thing you <malay>boleh buat</malay> so actually sometimes instead of complaining you can just look the other side [lah] or what
has
ya [lah]
(mm) ya right
<malay>kita</malay> complain complain <malay>hari-hari pagi petang malam pun</malay> you complain also the thing will still remain then <malay>takkan</malay> today you complain then tomorrow you do the same thing
right
true ya but I guess people are just people <malay>dah memang lumrah orang manusia ni kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>dia tak puas dia mesti ada benda nak cakap</malay> right
<malay>macam ni</malay> [lah] government government <malay>kasih duit orang</malay> complain government <malay>tak kasih duit pun orang</malay> complain
so I think ya
<malay>betul kita cakap orang pun</malay> I think <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>pun</malay> complain <malay>juga</malay>
true ya true
ya [lah] once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
sometimes you say it's bad but then if people say otherwise it's good you <malay>nak kena tengok</malay> you <malay>tak boleh degil</malay> you know <malay>nak dengar cakap</malay> you [jer]
ya
ya (mm) (mm)
ya that's what I mean [lah] ya
complain but at the end of the day I think especially <malay>kita kat sini kat</malay> singapore I think <malay>kita</malay> still not as bad as you compare to other countries
other countries other countries they locked down like
you can't even I mean you can maybe you <malay>boleh pergi beli pasar mungkin</malay> you <malay>boleh beli</malay>
<malay>beras</malay> all those <malay>barang dapur tapi dia kasih pergi mungkin</malay>
<malay>satu minggu sekali</malay> but still singapore I think
not bad [what] like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
(mm)
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
<malay>itu pun ada orang</malay> [kan] that time <malay>berapa</malay> a lot of people <malay>masuk</malay> facebook <malay>masuk</malay> stomp <malay>tak nak pakai</malay> then <malay>kena kena</malay> all the officers <malay>suruh dia orang pakai pun dia cari pasal</malay>
(mm)
ya by right <malay>bukan susah benda tu nak</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
I see them <malay>tu</malay> [lah] that time
government <malay>kasih</malay> free [leh] <malay>nak minta dia orang pakai</malay>

can <malay>semua boleh</malay> work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive [eh] and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's (err) very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them (uh) checklist (err) time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time [lah]

I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very (err) it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king #faisal# the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that [eh] <malay>dia ini macam macam mahu</malay> but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up

<malay>contohnya tadi aku bilang sama</malay> boss <malay>aku bilang sama</malay> you know <malay>aku bilangkan tadi</malay> kevin call <malay>aku</malay> kevin
kevin you remember kevin from covalent aircon [eh] kevin
so kevin came previously so if you saw right I put email <malay>dia</malay> I emailed him
<malay>dia punya</malay> request for this (um) to come down to check look at one eleven [kan]
was exhaust <malay>kau perasan</malay> [eh] so <malay>aku nak dia</malay> propose based on <malay>kita punya</malay> requirements <malay>apa dia punya</malay> exhaust fan size <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
so tomorrow he may come down around eleven thirty <malay>dia akan turun padang</malay> eleven thirty
<malay>kita bawa dia tengok tempat itu</malay> [kan]
yes correct [ah] you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
then boss say <malay>kenapa aku cakap</malay> because when I try to activate #rin cho#
he can he <malay>macam</malay> [ah] always busy <malay>kau faham</malay> he got a lot of excuses right and then we he don't want to come then he cannot even give us the required proposals and quotations
so I told boss that I rather do not waste that kind of time and <malay>buang masa</malay>
<malay>tunggu</malay> contractor <malay>yang tak begitu</malay> focus
<malay>ataupun yang</malay> not really looking for all these things [lah] so <malay>aku bilang dengan</malay> boss
[ah] <malay>aku bilang boss</malay> [ah] <malay>aku bilang</malay> covalent so far is the only company
that have come a few times and then talk to #azri# and me about what they need [kan] <malay>kau ingat</malay> [eh]
<malay>ingat tak</malay> the earlier case about the issue at level nine of tower
<malay>dengar dengar dengar</malay> they are the only one [eh] that give the proposals for both the air issue and the and the motor you notice
they are the only one [tau] even Y&T <malay>tak kasih</malay> [eh] Y&T <malay>belum kasih</malay>
Y&T <malay>kasih yang dulu punya kau ingat</malay> [ah] Y&T <malay>kasih yang lama tu yang kita pernah</malay> reject alright
Y&T <malay>belum kasih</malay> [tau] [ah] <malay>abeh tu aku nampak</malay> [ah] #kai long# <malay>ada kasih</malay> motor oddly [eh]
air asia <malay>tak kasih lepas tu</malay> [ah] ray #choo# <malay>belum kasih abeh tu</malay> company C <malay>belum kasih</malay>
<malay>kau bayangkan</malay> [tau] of all <malay>kita punya</malay> contractor <malay>lima</malay> company
<malay>ini</malay> covalent one company can give us that two proposal [tau] and it's only company <malay>kau faham tak</malay>
<malay>kenapa wani tak nak kasih</malay> so it means <malay>aku nak kena gunakan dia orang punya</malay> specs
<malay>nak kena</malay> call <malay>lagi</malay> invite quote for the other company [lah] that's what <malay>aku nak kena bikin</malay> later
<malay>mana</malay> covalent
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tengok kau tengok</malay> proposal okay <malay>bagi aku</malay> okay not bad
<malay>dia</malay> propose <malay>bikin</malay> asia <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh</malay>
can be done [ah] so <malay>aku nak kena minta dia orang</malay> so whether they want to go or not <malay>itu masalah dia sekarang kita nak perlukan</malay> we need <malay>lagi dua</malay> quote <malay>betul</malay>
[ah] <malay>lagi dua</malay> quote <malay>kita perlukan lagi dua</malay> quote <malay>untuk aku bilang kau</malay> [eh] <malay>aku macam nak minta</malay> #lye# <malay>kasih kita</malay> quotation [sia] <malay>untuk</malay> aircon works <malay>kalau dia boleh bikin</malay>
#lye# <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>kau cakap boleh kau cakap</malay>
#lye# #lye# #lye# #lye# <malay>ini</malay> [tau] <malay>takkan tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kau cakap orang ke melayu orang putih ni kau cakap orang putih ke melayu nama dia orang putih cakap betul-betul</malay> [lah]

<malay>tetapi bagi aku aku</malay> still <malay>akan</malay> invite <malay>dia</malay> to quote for whatever that he needs to quote [lah] correct
<malay>sebab</malay> the idea was given by him correct <malay>pasal itu</malay> motor correct
[ah] so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
so <malay>ini semua aku nak kena</malay> standby <malay>dia punya</malay> argument <malay>aku nak kena</malay> standby any email <malay>dapat nak kena tembak</malay> email <malay>sebab</malay>

we left already fiona told me [eh] #rasyidi# you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
this one install okay [lah] noted noted I not sure I'm here I'm only here six months I'm not sure so <malay>dia cakap</malay>
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
[ah] <malay>kata dia</malay> [lah] so okay [lah] so <malay>diam tak diam kirakan yang yang suruh rosakkan</malay>
the faulty full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost [lah]
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including for right correct
so that is the arrangement [lah] so tomorrow <malay>si</malay> covenant <malay>turun</malay>
we have to focus on this O one eleven exhaust <malay>kau tahu pasal</malay>
<malay>ini benda</malay> [eh] we really need to get the quote soon because richard <malay>dah tanya orang pun dah tanya</malay>
because <malay>ini beruang punya</malay> madam F <malay>kau si</malay> #xie#
<malay>si gemuk tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay> handover <malay>bulan</malay> september [tau]
he wants she wants to handover in september like that <malay>kau faham</malay>
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very [ah]
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
[ah] place [ah] so <malay>mereka dia ada</malay> plan <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>hebat</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk dapat tempat tu tapi</malay>
she got some requirement <malay>kau nampak</malay> there's some that you saw the email I know did you saw
top up <malay>dia punya</malay> cement twenty five add twenty five
<malay>lepas tu</malay> half of the probing
then number <malay>dua dia kata apa dia nak apa tu</malay> then they want to put the
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
<malay>nak letak</malay> gas outside [lah] then they want to puncture to our it is like good to have aesthetics
[ah] <malay>dia dia kirakan</malay> they want to do a lot of things okay but but whatever they do
later I show you [ah] the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means [ah]
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
to the centre of the place that is <malay>dia orang punya</malay> [ah] so called short floor [lah] correct
people will go there just to buy food and go away [ah] and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs [lah]
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
<malay>jadi</malay> [ah] twenty twenty five [tau] look
<malay>lepas tu dia orang kat atas ada</malay> big kitchen so that the other half [eh] all the way to the end of the unit is <malay>dia orang punya</malay> area [ah]
no the you mean the cement [eh]
the cement will be the second half of the unit [what] second half
it means it's not the for the front [tau] the front will be rental it would not go up !huh!
<malay>tak faham maksud kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu naik atas</malay> [ah] <malay>naik naik nak naik tu mesti naik punya</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau kau tak nampak tak</malay> obvious [ah] [kan]
<malay>depan depan</malay> the shop front front would not be affected <malay>yang belakang dia akan itu</malay>
[ah] they won't <malay>akan</malay> affect [lah] because behind they have to put some
maybe they have to put some
[ah] frosted glass <malay>ke apa</malay> they have to do something to cover the behind [ah]
<malay>tapi dia orang ada</malay> intention <malay>nak letak itu</malay> gas cylinder <malay>itu</malay> <malay>sebelah kanan</malay>
the <malay>dia punya</malay> piping <malay>dia cat warna putih tembus kita punya</malay> [ah] cladding [tau] <malay>masuk dalam</malay> above ceiling
toilet [eh] <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] most likely <malay>aku tengok dia orang akan</malay> convert <malay>sebagai</malay> store because <malay>dia kata dia tak nak dia punya</malay> staff <malay>gunakan</malay> toilet <malay>tu</malay>
they can go to the level one toilet
(mm) so
okay [lah] I mean <malay>tu dia punya hak</malay> [kan] it's up to them
then they can <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> convert <malay>tempat itu untuk macam tempat simpan barang-barang</malay> [lah]
[ah] to me okay [lah] I mean as long as <malay>dia orang bikin</malay>
<malay>apa yang dia nak gini tapi</malay> so far <malay>aku rasa</malay> based on my understanding is like
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
[ah] a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that [oh] the sprinkler worse [ah] don't need do submission
her consultancy [ah] the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
[ah] <malay>cakap dengan</malay> fiona I told fiona as and as long as you tie your sprinkler
you do modification you need to do submission to correct
that is a requirement <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] he said <malay>masa tu cakap tak payah</malay> there is a waiver from then you must show us which clause [ah]
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
<malay>tak boleh dia mesti ada</malay> submission you must do a proper submission
yes I know <malay>dia bilang apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia punya orang</malay> gas will do a submission
[ah] to but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct

[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! I I give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
this girl you know <malay>macam pergi</malay> date <malay>semua</malay> [kan] he she doesn't even want to be <malay>macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam</malay> playground <malay>gini kita dua</malay> [jer] [kan] let's say you are a guy
she doesn't want that
<malay>macam berdua-duaan abeh lepas tu kalau macam nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok wayang</malay> cinema <malay>macam dua orang</malay> even though there's there are other people but
is <malay>tetap macam korang dua orang</malay> [jer] [kan] in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ya so <malay>dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> I think he is ready
ready to settle down I think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if if I think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> she didn't
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) I never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] I no one has no one has asked me
at all
[orh] ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)

it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage (um) milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know (um) apparently they spend one point two
a hundred and twenty thousand I think (um) to work on the prisoners like (um) norway <malay>punya</malay> government (um) <malay>dorang macam</malay> (um)
<malay>dorang macam betul-betul</malay> (um)
<malay>bekerja keras</malay> towards
<malay>apa dia macam</malay> [ah] believe in (um) changing people instead of punishment like being at prison itself it's already a punishment but (err) so they don't believe in like you know (err) behind bars and everything ya
(um) <malay>macam</malay>
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then (err) that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals (um) but (err)
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like (um) like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
(um) of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though (um) ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much [ah]
ya (mm) [kan] <malay>macam susah sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab orang singapura ni dorang macam banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam buat ni salah buat tu salah</malay> [ah] <malay>kasi banyak duit salah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak kasi duit salah apa dorang nak</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau aku aku tak faham</malay> [ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya true
ya I actually binged watched that it's so interesting they only cover one asian country which is philippines philippines one is so bad it's so so bad do you know that like when you are captured like you are [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) somebody found like saw you at the the crime and they like bring you in I don't know what you call that they detain you
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
<malay>rabak gila aku macam aku macam</malay> woke you know <malay>macam</malay> shock so <malay>macam</malay> shock I'm so shook I'm so shook by the what like
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the the narrator was like
was like saying (um)
(err) the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
it's just (ugh) I don't know it's just !wow! it's just mindblown if you want [oh] was it vulgar ya I was thinking like maybe you can share these things <malay>dekat</malay> students but you know maybe is to be too
vulgar ya maybe can (um) ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
(err) prisons that are <malay>macam</malay>
different
because like (err) norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same [ah] philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya

<malay>ada ada berbual</malay>
<malay>selepas kita berbincang pasal</malay> (um)

ya ya ya repurpose those vintage whatever crap people will buy
(um) actually it has been going on for a while like actually like when I spoke
to #irani# about this he said [eh] you don't know flea market <malay>ada</malay> [sia] <malay>orang macam jual empat puluh sen</malay> [jer] but <malay>kawan kau jual sampai seratus lebih</malay> [eh]
<malay>mahal gila aku macam ada orang nak beli</malay> and <malay>dia cakap bangsa-bangsa dia</malay> [ah] <malay>beli yang macam kita tak sangat</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>mahal</malay>
(um) <malay>paling murah aku tengok anting-anting dia jual ninety</malay>
[ah] <malay>sembilan puluh lapan dolar</malay>
[ah]
(um)
<malay>anting-anting kecil gitu</malay>
<malay>macam gini</malay> [ah]

<malay>nampak bedek</malay> I'm like <malay>ye ke</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay> there are specific designs that look really exclusive but there are some looks kind of cheap
[ah] they actually have a stamp at the back ya so she cover that
in her in her ya ya but [ah] <malay>aku ada jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kat macam</malay> this (err) <malay>kat</malay> creative markets [ah] they are selling quite cheap affordable but of course you have to like you know do the
do the mechanics for ourselves [ah] to paste the thing and everything which I really want to try because because she said that she engaged (um) someone from japan to do this and her cost price is really high then I was like thinking maybe I should just do this for her [lah] then I just take commission from her you know what I mean because it's the same thing [ah] if I could offer slightly lower I earn and then she also can earn [what]
and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold
ya (mm) it's stainless steel
ya <malay>boleh karat</malay>
so <malay>aku macam aku macam nak aku nak tolong dia macam</malay> you know (err) <malay>beri beri sokongan</malay>

(mmhmm)
but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday [lah] ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with [lah]
but ya is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like (uh) if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
like I told him I mean I could just engage her now and then if next year it doesn't falls what she says like it will confirm because she she already confirm with the underwriting say like confirm confirm can can ya because she gave me the assurance so I mean I can just buy it and then like <malay>aku</malay> if doesn't then I will just terminate and just go to adam it's easy for me you know just like (um)
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment
ya so adam was supposed to
get back to me on that but he's not
no no no I

has it been an hour already
stop is gonna stop

[ah] volunteer next week [lah] <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia buat</malay> but [ah] like I told you [lah] we we started with the orientation online because <malay>sekarang</malay> we are still in the phase
two so according to ministry of health (uh) we cannot have face to face interaction with (um)
the patients [lah] the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
copyright copyrighting <malay>untuk</malay> (uh) <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> social media <malay>punya</malay> page [lah]
so ya [lah] that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
<malay>tak pergi mana-mana</malay> [lah] this is online because right now we are still in phase two (um) so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society <malay>punya</malay> volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because has strict guidelines <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) because people you know cannot meet
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online <malay>sedih engkau kau tengok</malay>
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was (um) they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
(ugh) so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good (um)
so I mean there are different things that we
can do [lah] <malay>macam</malay> so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for <malay>macam</malay> design (uh) photography
(uh) they have <malay>macam</malay> a knitting crochet with the patients but <malay>sekarang takde</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you know it's it's (uh) only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things [ah] cancer society they've been around for a long time <malay>jadi</malay> so they they're very established in the community
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined (um)
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously <malay>susah</malay>
(um) but they tried (uh) I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is (uh) the <malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> awareness (uh) campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these <malay>macam cakap cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
(uh) <malay>ramai orang macam takut nak buat</malay> cancer screening because of course <malay>takut</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people <malay>takut nak buat</malay> cancer screening
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot [lah] ya so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya I'm looking
forward to it [lah] honestly something I've been wanting to do for a <malay>macam dah lama gitu</malay> so (uh) ya #inshaallah# I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
you think so
no next week they will give me the (um) they have something in mind I think (uh) ya and then <malay>macam</malay> I'll just
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kalau boleh tolong</malay> then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
(uh) but of course they ask that [eh] no <malay>kalau</malay> once you commit you have to do it [ah] <malay>bukan macam suka-suka macam</malay> this week <malay>buat</malay> next week <malay>tak nak buat</malay> ya
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
you know next year when they start doing (uh) the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year <malay>bila</malay>
[oh] that's very soon
okay so what they do is on the form in (uh) <malay>apa apa tu</malay> during the four main religious group <malay>punya</malay> holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
<malay>hari raya dengan</malay> like #deepavali#
I think now <malay>dia tak buat apa-apa</malay> [lah] this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have (uh) all volunteers come together and <malay>kita macam</malay> pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have #ang pao#
[ah] so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff (um) and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families (um) with their expenses
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> afford treatment and then <malay>balik rumah rumah macam gitu</malay> and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them (um) like grants and and you know money like contributions (uh) so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year <malay>orang datang</malay> like people have to come to them to collect the #ang pao# (um) but this may be depending on (uh) whether or not phase three starts next year [lah] (um) I don't know whether that's going to happen <malay>ke tak</malay> ya so that's next year
<malay>kalau tidak</malay> boring <malay>aje</malay> [kan] <malay>buat</malay> remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
next year [lah] next year when we can
ya why not <malay>kenapa tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kau ingat aku apa</malay>
<malay>kau ingat aku apa</malay>
[oh] ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the (uh) programs where volunteers <malay>kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah</malay> [tau]
so
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean <malay>macam banyak macam</malay> program program [lah] you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya (um) ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then <malay>balik</malay> they are both
too <malay>penat</malay> (uh) the but (um) <malay>macam</malay> especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
<malay>kemaskan rumah</malay> they showed like one house <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kesian</malay> [lah] I <malay>tengokkan</malay> like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
(um) they bring in
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just <malay>makanan bawa pergi rumah dia</malay>
and stuff like that [lah] so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have <malay>macam apa tu</malay> volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
[a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
ya
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract <malay>untuk apa</malay> [kan] and it's really up to you
so
(mm)
but <malay>buat apa ni</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but but wait the dogs <malay>dari mana</malay>
the dogs <malay>kat mana</malay>
okay okay okay now I understand
[ah]
(mm)

<malay>tengah</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> ya that's true
it's quite near ya ya ya

like in the in the sense that you <malay>bayar untuk semua bende ni semua</malay>

to give <malay>macam</malay> to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of <malay>kasih anjing-anjing</malay>
<malay>apa punya</malay> development
property development (uh)
<malay>mana kita ada</malay> jungle what we don't have any jungle
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
so what does have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
but do you all know you know as volunteers of (uh) and working in this working in this (uh) <malay>apa tu dia</malay> sector does the government actually have a plan (uh) when when <malay>macam</malay> like they go now <malay>kat belakang ni</malay> like there's this
<malay>tengah tengah</malay> this new development <malay>kat tengah kat belakang sini</malay>
do you know do these groups which are know if the government has a <malay>macam apa tu cakap</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> contingency [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> plan [lah] like a plan when they develop these new lands
that they know
all these (uh) animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
but they've been developing singapore for how long <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam sampai sekarang tak tahu</malay>
(mm) #pasir ris# <malay>pun ada babi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
but how can it be <malay>macam gini</malay> like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if <malay>macam kita baru</malay> start <malay>nak</malay> develop lands or takeover lands it's been <malay>macam</malay> we've been we've been building
and and other housing since <malay>bila kita punya</malay> independence nineteen sixties [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
(mm)
so that's only the dogs because I know <malay>dekat</malay> #pasir ris# when I went (uh) #pasir# park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
where are the pythons
no I don't know
(mm)
ya because recently [kan] <malay>ada perempuan tu yang kena</malay> attack <malay>tu</malay>
ya ya
[eh] <malay>kau punya kerusi ni gatal</malay> [seh]
<malay>gatal</malay> [lor]
no it's your skin
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay <malay>jangan duduk situ</malay>
<malay>kesian</malay> spoke but so what what happens so who
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> it's been there for awhile <malay>dengan macam</malay>
<malay>terus kasih</malay> [lah] I always said that
<malay>tapi</malay> so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the <malay>apa anjing-anjing</malay> [kan] I can see
and the (uh) <malay>siapa nama tu</malay>
(uh) the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
who takes care who is supposed to because <malay>kat sini</malay> I've seen <malay>satu</malay> just one snake and
<malay>apa</malay> ACRES
hello this is art [ah] by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a (um) a a young and
really up and coming artist and
he's a syrian refugee <malay>dia tinggal dekat</malay> lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways [ah] <malay>cakap macam gitu</malay>
so no honestly (uh) <malay>apa cakap ular-ular</malay>
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
it's not as easy as [oh] <malay>nampak anjing</malay> [oh] (uh) <malay>nampak babi</malay> we can see it we can you know some kind of action the <malay>ular ni</malay> you know <malay>macam kat bawah-bawah</malay> and then in the <malay>longkang-longkang</malay> you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but [eh] <malay>takut</malay>
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
(uh) snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about (uh) <malay>ular macam ular</malay> coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen <malay>satu kat sini</malay>
and and then <malay>dia macam masuk dalam longkang</malay> and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to <malay>macam takut</malay> (uh) because I can't I <malay>betul betul</malay> there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards <malay>tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh</malay> so
so the thing is <malay>dekat</malay> here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the (um) the stray dogs there is a family of three <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
the lorries ya so there's
one auntie <malay>dia</malay> (um) auntie <malay>tinggal kat tak tahu</malay> block <malay>mana</malay> she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that (uh) <malay>dulu dia kena saman</malay> because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about <malay>macam</malay> people feeding (uh) stray cats or stray dogs but auntie <malay>ni</malay> sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food <malay>untuk</malay> she feeds a lot of stray cats <malay>macam</malay> she brings <malay>macam besar</malay> you know <malay>macam orang-orang macam ini</malay> (um)
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting (um) for <malay>dia dia cakap dia kena</malay>
<malay>kena saman</malay> so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
!huh!
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie <malay>sekarang pun nak kena</malay> she has to be careful because she also puts out (uh)
(uh)
<malay>air untuk kucing-kucing ni</malay> so the problem is our area <malay>kat sini</malay> is a high dengue area
[ah]
<malay>tu apa</malay>
[oh] okay
(mm)
what do you mean two hours to clear <malay>siapa yang pergi</malay> check
<malay>siapa yang nak</malay> catch
what do you mean walk past <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> fine <malay>tak boleh</malay> feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours <malay>ni</malay>
how do they know <malay>macam</malay> who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
(um) <malay>tapi kau duduk situ</malay> so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
(mm) okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>mesti</malay> clear [lah]
<malay>tapi dia</malay> the feeder <malay>mesti</malay> clear <malay>makanan tu</malay>
[oh]
[ah] because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> ya that's true
<malay>lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia</malay> how much is the <malay>saman</malay>
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
[oh] I didn't know that
[oh]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>mana ada kat sini</malay> signs
who puts up these these signs
[oh] say
(mm)
ya but the the cats <malay>kat sini bagus juga</malay> [lah] and honestly the cats around here <malay>gemuk-gemuk</malay> because of <malay>macam</malay> auntie <malay>macam gini</malay> and this
[eh] <malay>apa kat belakang ni</malay> there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same <malay>kat sini</malay> so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute <malay>nama dia</malay> sausage <malay>aku kasih nama</malay> [jer] [lah] so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
<malay>sampai</malay> (uh) auntie <malay>kat bawah ni</malay> you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window (um) I can see someone else coming there's another man <malay>kat dia tinggal kat</malay> I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage <malay>ni</malay> honestly I've never seen stray cats
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
I mean (uh) <malay>macam</malay> the the
size <malay>tu macam</malay> comparable to a domestic cat like a cat <malay>punya kat kat rumah orang</malay> ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of <malay>kat sini</malay> I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
have run away <malay>dulu</malay> we used to see more of the dogs
(uh) during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because <malay>takde orang keluar</malay> [kan]
so I saw them <malay>dia selalu tidur</malay> under the this lorry because <malay>orang pun tak kerja</malay> so they were like always sleeping the three of them
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the <malay>kucing</malay> but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one <malay>betul</malay> I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore (uh) <malay>anjing tak dah takde lagi</malay>
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had <malay>kat depan ni</malay> right in front here there's these two big palm trees [kan] so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood <malay>macam</malay> this (um) once or twice we've seen them along the <malay>macam apa tu</malay> the park connector here at #bukit batok# going up to #clementi# but they came here the whole there were like there first of all <malay>dia hantar satu agaknya macam</malay> scout came scout <malay>nampak pokok ni</malay> scout stayed there so I took <malay>gambar</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan</malay> camera <malay>tu</malay> and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the <malay>apa ni</malay> I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was <malay>dekat apa jalan dekat</malay> park connector <malay>tu</malay> I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big <malay>longkang</malay>
they are so you see <malay>kat sana ada</malay> the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is <malay>keluar pergi</malay>
<malay>jalan</malay> you know everybody suddenly everybody <malay>pergi</malay> (uh) exercise so in that <malay>apa tu nama dia longkang</malay> the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore (uh) even
the animals crossing the path <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while (um) ya
it's just the regular birds the #minahs# the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
(uh) but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop (um) and they would do their swimming swimming but <malay>tu macam</malay> exhibitionist [tau] the otters are huge exhibitionists
yes
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the <malay>longkang</malay> where did they go to the (uh) the botanic garden
so they came out <malay>macam</malay> every night
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens [kan] not like before
(hmm)
(mm)
<malay>kesian</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but they're not the ones <malay>yang kat dalam longkang ni</malay> they're not that big <malay>dekat sini kat</malay> park connector the one that goes up to #pandan#
like different kinds of otters
<malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>jangan bedek</malay> [lah] <malay>kau cakap</malay> different family different types [lah]
what do you mean <malay>mana ada</malay> clan
<malay>macam apa</malay> clan
okay
[eh] <malay>kau jangan tipu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana boleh gini</malay>
what is that what fan club
[eh] <malay>kau macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau jangan bedek</malay> [lah] I mean sorry this is not
this is this sounds too
like on the ground <malay>macam</malay> they go and <malay>macam nak nak pergi cari</malay>
[ah] okay like like the people who go #sungei buloh# <malay>cari burung cari burung</malay> [ah] okay okay okay
but they all look the same <malay>apa macam mana nak ada</malay> divide
so the one <malay>yang</malay> that I say <malay>kat sini</malay>
they're so cute they really are very cute
during the circuit breaker [kan] so I read about the one <malay>yang</malay>
the ones that went to #serangoon# road
(uh) ya
so do they <malay>macam pindah</malay> from one place to another or when you say <malay>dia orang macam</malay> this otter clan #kallang# clan do they just live there <malay>atau macam</malay>
they come <malay>kat sini</malay> to look for the
#bukit batok# clan what what I honestly don't understand <malay>macam mana ni</malay>
<malay>lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana</malay> of course you have to look for <malay>orang lain</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm)
sausage sausage
<malay>lepas tu bila nak kahwin macam mana</malay>
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(mm)
I didn't know about that
<malay>lepas tu sekarang macam mana</malay> where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so <malay>macam</malay> do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and <malay>dia orang macam</malay> what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
is do they like
<malay>macam</malay> during the circuit breaker <malay>macam</malay> okay so that one whole family <malay>keluar pergi</malay> #serangoon# road <malay>nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa</malay> [eh] when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just <malay>macam duduk kat situ aje</malay>
[ah] okay
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes <malay>kat sini</malay> in the drain
how did the otters from <malay>macam</malay> botanic gardens <malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>kat sini</malay> like #bukit batok# because there is a whole we we see a lot in #bukit batok# at the park connector in the <malay>longkang</malay>
how do they
#serangoon#
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
like do they get tagged by <malay>apanya nama dia</malay> ACRES
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about <malay>macam</malay> on social media <malay>pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk</malay> all the otters knew there was once <malay>kat</malay> #clementi# (uh) near sixth avenue that big <malay>longkang</malay>
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the <malay>apa longkang besar</malay>
(um) but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it <malay>macam</malay> a new development that they came from somewhere
<malay>kau nak pergi mana lepas tu</malay>
[oh] okay
[eh] <malay>kau jangan bawa</malay> telephone <malay>kau masuk</malay> toilet <malay>boleh nanti orang dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> can you please not <malay>macam gini</malay> this <malay>lucah</malay> can you please close the door
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
(mm)
so ya that's what I'm saying because <malay>dulu</malay> I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya [lah] wildlife ya [lah] of course aware but <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] what I'm saying is <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> honestly I mean I grew up in <malay>kampung</malay> we did not hear about all these otters during <malay>kampung dulu kampung banyak benda</malay> of course we had the <malay>monyet</malay> we actually had the <malay>monyet</malay> (uh) then
snakes of course
(um) we had our chickens and
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in <malay>kampung</malay> but we had the big <malay>longkang-longkang</malay>
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
so <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the <malay>macam</malay> the public's consciousness
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
okay that's new to me
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged <malay>macam apa tu namanya</malay> microchipped
(mm) (mm)
do they no I mean when you say they care for them <malay>bukan macam</malay> it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at <malay>macam</malay> you can't walk the otter
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves [kan]
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>tengok burung-burung</malay>
in singapore do they have them <malay>macam untuk ular-ular</malay>
because I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore [kan] I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at <malay>macam</malay> just hiding away and going into the <malay>longkang</malay>
(mm)
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
(mm)
[ah]
but how do you <malay>macam</malay> if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the <malay>longkang</malay> then it just disappears
[oh] I I remember <malay>dulu dekat</malay> the the <malay>kat mana tu</malay> I don't know what [lah] it was in the news was it a python
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something
!huh!
what
the snake ate the cat
<malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
so what happens when ACRES comes when <malay>apa</malay> the the snake now it has the
<malay>kucing</malay> the <malay>kucing</malay> is in the <malay>perut</malay>
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else [kan] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> redhill <malay>kat bawah</malay> block <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you you can't just leave it there
but but
but now we have less and less
so [a'ah]

okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
like <malay>takde takde</malay> [ah] [sia]
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better [lah]
like I know the outro was a bit okay [lah]
a bit better
because the outro previously was like [meh]
ya
now I think intro okay [lah] still what my second second video
so
third third video still using the software and yesterday it kept crashing [sia] cause like I I don't know the thing the RAM was like <malay>macam bodoh gila</malay>
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that [one] eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together (uh) then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade [ah]
saw online like two hundred fifty [sia] for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
but ya it's ya it's two fifty I'm planning to buy because <malay>macam</malay> at least it's
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it [ah] [sia]
just buy [ah]
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade [lah] as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five [eh] the new Ryzen four gen four [eh] gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
so now if they go up one and then the laptop goes up one and then it's like <malay>macam bodoh</malay> like that you know then now so now it's like <malay>macam</malay>
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
!wow!
then what they release it as
the fuck [sia]
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him [lah]
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company [lah] I guess
but okay [lah] it all worked out for them
<malay>macam</malay> some of them is like really like very big but hopefully the guy gets a lot of money [ah]
free money [sia]
ya
Sony is terrible [sia] you know they don't allow discord on five I'm like what the fuck [sia]
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users
ya ya it's terrible [eh]
no the the thing is I'm like okay if you have a four chat you know but then now a lot of games support cross play and then you like
and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first [one] that was like quite good [sia]
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course (uh) I mean I took awhile before I went to discord
whatever it is better than Razer comms man Razer comms was shit man
that fiasco I remember [sia] it ate up so much RAM everything lag
because they wanted to make the U I like very good and shit one thing about Razer they all always don't optimise their software their software is always <malay>macam tahi</malay> [sia]

Razer is like so diverse is nonsensical
and then you have like the old models and then new models and then they all look kind of the same
it's like the worse [sia] it's like it's like (err) it's like (err)

[oh]
because you like like considered like you increase the risk of COVID spreading is it in australia I mean australia got a lot of weird environmental laws [lah]
ya
australian or singapore
australian is
you know at singapore currency is stronger than australia now
after very long no
now is like their three thousand is two thousand plus
or what
ya I think
ninety cents around there ya that means means ours is stronger I'm actually surprised I remember last time people were like go australia one point four
then the currency drop like shit
no now the best place to go new zealand they don't need wear mask anymore
but then it's like
ya I mean it's it's normal [ah] I mean at the end of the day as long as the the whole world is not clear of this thing confirm got one but if you stop them at the boarder then it's fine in the end <malay>macam</malay> singapore's <malay>punya ape itu</malay> their way is like rapid testing and shit what so like for them is okay [lah]
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week [oh] ya [oh] that means it really surged [sia] !wah!
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only [sia]
[oh] my god
because it's expensive [eh] you know COVID treatment there is like thirty thousand [sia] not like us like you go to doctor with like respiratory <malay>punya</malay> illness or whatever cock and then like you go you [ah] <malay>apa</malay> you go there again you get we pay ten dollars they have to pay for a nonsense amount of money [one] doctor's visit is like hundred plus [sia]
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya [lah]
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals [ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like #siao# [lah]
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage [eh] only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck [ah]
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
quite quite a high amount [ah] like <malay>merepek</malay> kind of prices [ah] like here okay [ah] somebody sick just call ambulance [ah] next time can pay I mean at the end of the day it's government run so like
ya
the because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money [ah] then then but but that is unlikely [ah]
at the end of the day if they are able to like do so much for the COVID <malay>punya</malay> crisis they have a lot of bank [lah] so
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like [ah] you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late [ah] can got late payment [ah]
but there's no interest [lah]
ya
you know the new #borat# movie coming out soon #borat#
and then there's this video of (uh) donald trump's lawyer rudy #giuliani#
so the thing is right he was [ah] asked to come to the bed [ah] the hotel room of the #borat# #borat# two got #borat# and his daughter I think
so the daughter of #borat# supposedly [lah] ask him to come to the room and shit [lah]
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever [lah] so then he put #borat# put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
[ah] so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room [ah] then he was in the room [ah] then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the #borat# came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen [ah] she was twenty four [lah] but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is [oh] he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet [ah] but a few people in the media industry watched it [ah] like I because #borat# does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week [lah] next week monday most likely the video goes public [ah]
[ah] no they he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad [ah]
#borat# does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer [ah] the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video [sia] come on guys
no [ah] they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
<malay>apa lagi kau nak</malay> [kan]
why
why [sia]
[oh] they <malay>tutup</malay>
!haiya! they I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
#taiwan# [ah]
the missile [lah]
#taiwan# [ah]
ya it's always always like that [one] it doesn't do anything is more of a <malay>macam</malay> threat kind of thing
this is how countries do diplomacy [lah]
same like north korea what
no this is this is called no it's diplomacy it's called like <malay>macam</malay> firm diplomacy [lah] or some shit like that
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions [lah] it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over #taiwan# then it says #taiwan# wasn't theirs in the first place
because they keep saying that #taiwan# is part of china like <malay>jangan</malay> world [lah] bro
the only sad part is actually #taiwan# defeated not defeated [lah] kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
and then like they are not under the world health organisation <malay>punya</malay> data list because they are not listed as a country
because china is
ya ya #taiwan# isn't listed as a country of the because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china and a few other countries
republic of #taiwan# no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news [ah]
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between #taiwan# and singapore is that we are not under another country
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean !hey! are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like [eh] [eh] boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't have you seen the video
that [one] that [one] that [one] really <malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
no now it's worse because of COVID now you know malaysia lockdown you know [ah] <malay>ape tu</malay>
#wari# #wari# #wari# <malay>kena</malay> locked out of he was at his <malay>kampung</malay>
and then now cannot go back home
[ah] so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because lockdown back
so he's like then I message he message me boring [ah] <malay>kat kampung aku nak balik main</malay> computer
then I was like (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> then I like I didn't know that time that was lockdown I found out from him it's like [ah] lockdown <malay>balik</malay> then it's like [ah] lockdown [sia]
[oh] okay
why [ah] then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think #sabah# had (err) election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like [oh] that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread [lah] I guess
I don't know [lah] difficult [lah] the policies they have also not very strong so
they all busy fighting each other also so <malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to [lor]
to like buy stuff buy fuel
[a'ah] [sia]
[eh] come on [ah] it's one third the price bro that means [eh] I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time [ah] [jer] per week [sia] that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only [sia] instead of times three [ah] two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time [mah] you travel there [ah]
every month [eh]
but okay [lah] takes a lot of time [ah] I personally don't do it because
jam [ah]
always jam
and then the closest [one] near #tuas# and then #tuas# you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
like the Shell there and that's it then like <malay>macam</malay> boring [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
ya but can is can [ah] but <malay>malas</malay>
like <malay>ni semua nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> to me <malay>tak nak dia lebih</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
but okay what [ah] now got the discount what twenty percent [sia] for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is [ah] if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions [lah] okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight [ah] I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line

he got a lot illegal shit that he has done he scared <malay>kena</malay> indicted

I'm I (uh) I really don't care
who
#valkrae#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya #alexandria ocasio-cortez# ya she she was the highest the most viewed stream on twitch [sia] the most viewed stream I was like [oh] !wow! but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really [sia] she's really good [sia] and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan [eh] like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also [ah] bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say [ah] aggressive a lot of people don't like her
because she's one thing because she's a woman [lah] and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino [ah] and then another thing <malay>macam</malay> she very fierce
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like [oh] she's too progressive
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] (err) reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering [lah] begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
is one point two K every week [eh]
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same [ah] it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything [ah] he's not gonna like [oh] let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
[oh] my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like [ah] the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct [oh] my god I was like (ugh) and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
<malay>tu [ah]</malay>
world [sia]
no the thing is <malay>dia</malay> world and then people still believe him I like [sial] [ah] and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
never right
[kan] [ah]
any proof [ah] I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview [ah] like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things [ah]
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially <malay>macam</malay> controversial issues [lah]
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation [lah] the questions [ah] then after that he got
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back <malay>macam</malay> you gonna release it first because he wants to say that <malay>macam</malay> they gonna portray it like differently but then <malay>macam</malay>
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes [ah] like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
[kan]
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible [ah]
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible [ah] that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran [oh] which <malay>surah</malay> you like you know then you like [oh] I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
ya no the thing is like no I that people [oh] ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time <malay>macam</malay> [oh] who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit [lah]
so that time he was asking like [oh] [ah] <malay>ape</malay>
so how how's your job you know like [ah] do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
[ah] who are you voting this guy ask [lah] like this random trump guy like so are you voting for trump this year he's like ya so how how's your (uh) what do you do for a job then it's like [oh] no he ask like <malay>macam</malay> how's your how do you think trump is affecting the economy [oh] is
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like !aww! man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn [ah] like this moneylenders
or all these like or <malay>ape</malay>
like other crap [lah] that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same [ah]
but like this [ah]
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses [lah]
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a it is govern by the government [lah] so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard [lah]
they are not going to closed down and the like [oh] no more public transport for singapore

I remember during that period I went like
at like two to the grocery store
because no one is awake right
so it's like lesser people to fight with
but then the thing
they restocking around that period as well
ya
then got nothing for you
ya
ya
that's why [ah]
no [lah] mine got more mine got three or four three or four no mine cause it's twenty four hours
but mine they do the restocking at that time so cannot be two person what
the store quite big [sia] mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
ya
[ah] ya
ya that's the thing [ah]
[ah] okay
put the money then go [jer]
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]

that's why [ah] WhatsApp group dangerous
all this fake news
I I never really like
like some people just join [sia] random WhatsApp group you know like

I can just send some random shit that I made
<malay>jangan bodoh</malay> bro
one thing at least singapore give free mask okay [ah]
I feel the free mask initiative was quite good
two time [oh] ya ya ya okay [ah] not bad

yes
(err) I'm fine thank you
ya
(um) I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about (um)
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me (um)
(ugh)
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like (err) couple
so <malay>dia orang</malay> like (um)
<malay>dia orang</malay> want to <malay>dia orang</malay> exit already <malay>tapi dia orang nak masuk balik</malay> so when they want to <malay>masuk balik</malay> and then like the security guard stop them [lah]
so ya so they they block the way and then like before that I saw them go out already but <malay>dia orang</malay> like (um)
they insisted coming in [lah] and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they block the way and then this security guard was like (um) he turned a bit and he accidentally touched the wife's hand like arm the wife's arm ya correct so he was like accidentally touched [lah] <malay>lepas tu dia</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> couple <malay>tak</malay> happy [lah] <malay>habis tu dia orang</malay> (um) so like the security guard
[ah] redirected to me and then like I I I ask [lah] hi sir how may I help you
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] like I <malay>nak pergi beli</malay> (uh) I <malay>nak pergi ambil</malay> allen key
[ah] <malay>dia nak pergi ambil</malay> allen key [lah] <malay>daripada dia punya</malay> service counter <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
after they take the like they want to take the allen key <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [eh] (err) please tell him do not touch people I'm like okay sure but like honestly I looked at it and then they were blocking the exit and then they were stopping like at least ten people from moving so it's <malay>dia orang punya pasal</malay> [lah]
(err) when when they left I ask this security guard [lah] like you know (um) like <malay>tak kisah pasal dia orang</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> (um) they they were trying to be difficult [lah] because you are just stopping them from entering once they exited because there's only one way exit one way enter right
so <malay>lepas tu</malay> another security guard <malay>datang lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] (err) this couple [lah] they have a problem [lah] they told me already like about how the other security guard tried to touch the wife then like I also question mark [lah] why why
why (um) why do you (err) (err) how did he touch in the first place <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>dia dah cakap lepas tu</malay> they leave the security guard feel okay maybe this one is just a problematic customer [lah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> there's no allowed nobody's allowed to eat in the store
(um) and so (err)
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
[eh] <malay>tak boleh cakap nama dia</malay>
<malay>tak boleh cakap nama</malay> store
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
<malay>tapi</malay> like you are not supposed to eat there [lah] because
<malay>takut</malay> you expose yourself to
at your you're risking yourself [lah] to exposure to virus so
ya [lah] <malay>lepas tu dia</malay> argued <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] my wife is eating I'm not eating and I'm taking the allen key
<malay>lepas tu</malay> we're like no
no eating in the store at all you know
rude [lah] so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like (um) like we don't have a like (um) like we are like lower than them
correct ya so (err)
ya then the day before it was quite funny because (um) there was this (err) couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in !hey! but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then (um) ya so they were they came in and
(err) I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like !hey! why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
<malay>jadi dia cakap</malay> [lor] you know like (um)
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like (err) she was like [oh] like I'm educated you know why you so rude I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
(mmhmm)
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time [ah] they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards (um) crane operators (err) tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
correct because technically this virus is gonna extend until one year so like you you cannot just like sit down <malay>kat rumah</malay> and then like <malay>melepak tengok</malay> <malay>tengok</malay> youtube <malay>macam</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay> so that's fucking unproductive I don't like it
(mm) (mm)
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
(mmhmm)
!wah! that is late
(mm)
my alarm [lah] [oh] my god
you know that's a typical (um) an (err) reaction from old people the audience be like
[oh] like you're doing this you're doing that you know at the end of the day you're gonna get like <malay>pahala</malay> I'm like sometimes [kan] you <malay>buat kerja bukan pasal pahala</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja pasal</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> care for the person you know
<malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tengah</malay> cleaning <malay>buntut lagi</malay>
you <malay>nangis</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>nangis ke tak</malay>
your mum's friend
okay
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>kasih</malay> birth to <malay>anak tu lepas tu anak tu yang nak mati dulu</malay> kind of thing
(mm)
(mmhmm)
correct
!wow! <malay>nasi rawon bukan nasi biasa</malay> [tau]
(mm)
!aduh!
(mm) (mm)
that is right
correct
(mm)
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
(mm)
(mm)
you <malay>tahu kenapa tak pasal</malay> I would think that he thinks like you are more easy to manipulate and you are more kind so <malay>kalau</malay> you are more easy to manipulate and you're kinder even though it sounds like bastard to say
<malay>tapi</malay> like you know people like to tend to take advantage of these things <malay>macam</malay> even when like I'm usually like I'm usually a kind person and all that right and then like you know after awhile you notice like [oh] I feel like they are taking advantage of me then like I will just stop [lah] or just like you know I can't do this for you anymore
because like <malay>memang</malay> like I think it's just human nature [lah] like they trying always trying to find ways to take advantage of people but I just find that is not a way to live your life
#alhamdulillah#
<malay>tu memang dah macam amanah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia sedekah gaji itu</malay> [kan]
(mm) #alhamdulillah# <malay>banyak rezeki</malay>
you <malay>macam</malay> <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) in debts [lah]
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share [lah] we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you [lah] as of now [lah]
ya because like I mean like for
me right simply if I really care for that person I don't mind but like at the same time like <malay>kalau</malay> is those people that I'm not close to or whatever right then like (um)
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes [lah] like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like (um) I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it [lah] in terms of like
like it'll be nice if he would I mean like for me I think he would feel that it's nice if you could send him off you know you know I mean <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>bila dia dia dah nak meninggal</malay> [kan] <malay>habis</malay> you <malay>ada kat sana</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at the same time [meh] <malay>pasal dia punya</malay> selfish thoughts <malay>macam begitu</malay> he should let you go because
like you know you need to go and live your life because after he dies maybe in like one or two years I don't know I'm not praying for him to die but like <malay>bila dia dah meninggal</malay> like you have to live your life and his [ah] if he's asking you to sacrifice your life
just to <malay>jaga dia bila masa</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak belajar</malay>
<malay>lagipun dia ada banyak</malay> family around here daddy is swag
like
correct because I mean I understand [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> family [kan] <malay>tapi tak</malay> close <malay>dengan</malay> family <malay>tu macam</malay> like <malay>saudara saudara tak tak rapat</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> like (um) in terms of helping right ya [lah] like that [lah] but like like you just have to help your family [lah] you know
like my (um) my side of the family is like <malay>kalau ada kerja kahwin</malay> or <malay>kenduri</malay> right my family will be the one as helping the rest of the family near extended family they be like the women will be busy makeup [lah] blah blah blah all that shit I'm like
<malay>lepas tu</malay> like one of them had even the cheek to say like when at that point [kan] they will like going to get married soon they'll like [eh] <malay>nanti bila kita kahwin</malay> (uh)
<malay>kau orang suka tolong-tolong</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti kita</malay> (err) <malay>kita kahwin kau orang tolong</malay> [ah] this kind of things it's like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not (um)
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
I don't think that's how you should behave [lah] because then you see the core of your personality you know <malay>lepas tu</malay> like this particular cousins they are like always
[ah] even when there is a wedding they <malay>tak datang</malay> on time <malay>dia orang datang lambat</malay> even the people that they're supposedly close to [ah] like like these cousins these two cousins are so like is apparently close but then even on that cousin's wedding day
the close cousin <malay>pun datang lambat</malay> so I feel like <malay>ni apa punya</malay> attitude <malay>ni lepas tu dia orang dah kahwin</malay> and they're going to breed this kind of
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before [lah] like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like [oh] my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and (um)
(um) for me because (um)
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home [lah] which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of (err)
job but (err) my step mum <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tanya dia cakap ada cukup duit tak</malay> then I'm like ya <malay>cukup cukup cukup</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like I told you before right like my father <malay>memang apa macam babi</malay> like you know like he fucking like (um) <malay>tengok</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay> youtube every single day <malay>pukul</malay>
sixty only ya and he watches he watches youtube in the fucking morning and then when I want to <malay>mengaji</malay> then he on the bloody video damn loud then I can't concentrate you know
after that <malay>ustazah</malay> he just wants to watch because he's bored nobody wants to talk to him
like like then after that I <malay>ustazah</malay> say [lah] like like you know like
(err) <malay>perlahan-perlahan</malay> [lah] <malay>baca</malay> [lah] <malay>kat bawah buku tu ada cakap baca dengan perlahan kalau</malay> (err) <malay>perlu</malay> (err) <malay>ulang</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi tapi</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan ustazah ustazah bapa saya tengah main</malay> video <malay>saya tak boleh</malay> concentrate <malay>lepas tu ustazah macam</malay> awkward [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay
ya correct (mm) and then like
for me right my my <malay>bapa</malay> is
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
<malay>macam dia</malay>
<malay>macam pemalas</malay> [jer] <malay>gila babi</malay> [tau]
like <malay>satu dia</malay> like <malay>dah lama tak kerja</malay> and he's just (err) waiting for government to give him money
and then like (um) (err) what do you call that like <malay>dia tengok</malay> youtube videos every single day <malay>pagi-pagi pukul tujuh setengah dia boleh</malay> on <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> until like late at night he watches but nowadays because the other day he confessed to me he never pay
(um) electricity bills for two months can you imagine that shit he never pay for two months <malay>habis dia nak dia nak siapa yang bayar</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak kerja</malay> then (um) ya then I just keep quiet [lah] like it's your problem [what] I mostly not at home and you are the one who's youtubing like the whole bloody day so I'm like whatever [lah] you know
like you you figure your shit out [lah]
my mum know [lah] that he doesn't work [lah]
that's why she divorce him [lah]
you know
when I was in (err) primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long (um)
since I was in primary two [ah] I don't know eight years old (um) now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no [lah] she remarried and then (um) she divorced when I was in ya
(mm)
ya then like #alhamdulillah# like long time [lah] but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family [lah] and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said [eh] (err) I'm going to I'm going to the food court [lah] to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
(err) he got his heartbroken and <malay>dia dia nak</malay> console [lah] <malay>kawan dia</malay> [lah]
<malay>lepas tu kawan dia punya</malay> crush
(err) slept with [eh] will slept with a friend when she was drunk so like technically like for me [lah] I like <malay>dia tu bukan</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> girlfriend couple <malay>dia punya</malay> crush <malay>sahaja</malay> you you <malay>nak</malay> sad sad <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>nak macam ada apa tu nama dia macam</malay>
you <malay>nak</malay> (um) act as if she's your girlfriend for what you know
<malay>lepas tu</malay> my my my my my my brother just had to bloody say that (uh) [oh] <malay>kawan dia</malay> actually <malay>kaya dia macam</malay> from a well to do family [lah] [lah] [lah] [lah]
do you know what my father say he say (um) [oh] <malay>jadi kalau kalau adik kalau</malay> (um) <malay>pergi keluar dengan dia</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti dia nak dia nak belanja tak belanja belanja</malay> coke <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
<malay>lepas tu macam mana</malay> you <malay>tak darah</malay> up [kan] so I <malay>darah</malay> up I <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau nak kalau nak</malay> [ah] <malay>jumpa kawan bukan minta upah apa lepas tu dia dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap dia macam nak</malay> weekend excuse [lah] <malay>macam dia</malay> joking but I wasn't having it I was angry
<malay>lepas tu</malay> what the
ya I mean like fuck man like <malay>dia dah tak nak kerja dia selalu nak</malay> my father [lah] <malay>dia tak nak kerja dia selalu nak tunggu orang kasih dia duit dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pemalas</malay>
I mean literally all he does at home is watch videos and (um)
put clothes in the the washing machine and then (err) <malay>gantung</malay> which takes less than fifteen minutes honestly
and then like he expects the women at home to do all the shit for him like <malay>kerja</malay> (um) <malay>kemas rumah masak lipat baju</malay> #makingkan# <malay>dia kopi</malay>
I mean (mm) <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you old school [kan] you <malay>kerja apa</malay>
<malay>jadi dia nak tunngu orang kasih dia duit aje macam apa macam babi</malay> [tau] and then I even have like I'm working with a guy (um) this <malay>pakcik</malay> he's about seventy plus seventy two
<malay>dia masih kerja</malay> I saw like another one is like I'm sure he's about seventy plus eighty [lah] this other old man and he's so handsome you know he so energetic he's a handsome old man
and like he's working
you know what excuse does my father have to to not work and like like lounge around and wait for somebody to <malay>macam kasih dia duit</malay> you know what you mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>tak suka tinggal dekat rumah sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok dia</malay> unproductive I <malay>rasa macam beban</malay> [tau] like
sometimes I really like
like just (err) pray to god [lah] #alhamdulillah# my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know (err) one funny day (err) my youngest sister told me she's like
[oh] <malay>kakak</malay> you know (err) we were talking about how when you die right and then (um) (um)
there's an option for you to stay with your husband or wife in the in the <malay>bumi</malay> right
my step mum <malay>cakap dia tak nak jumpa</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay>
ya [lah] so in <malay>bumi</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> mark like husband and wife right <malay>tapi</malay> in <malay>syurga</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you you still want to be together or not
[ah] my mum say <malay>tak nak</malay> myself say
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
I can see sometimes he's caring but [ah] as as the days go by as I watch him every single thing he say triggers me in a sense that <malay>macam</malay> became <malay>geram</malay> became <malay>macam kau dah</malay> [lah] <malay>pemalas tak nak buat kerja kau</malay> also <malay>nak meminta-minta dekat orang buat apa</malay>
<malay>lagipun</malay> right half of our lives he never raise us and !huh! correct <malay>dia tak kasih nafkah pun jadi macam mana dia nak</malay> expect <malay>kita yang anak-anak yang ada yang empat empat yang dah besar ni nak selalu kasih dia duit ke apa ke</malay> correct
I mean we don't think like that [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> my mum is the one who thinks like that but at the same time we think like okay I will just give what we can give but we will not give our father we will give our step mum
until my step mum <malay>macam berasa macam bersalah lepas tu dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>nanti</malay> (err) <malay>ni siapa dah kasih duit siapa dah kasih duit</malay>
ya so for me right usually <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak kasih</malay> I <malay>kasih</malay> my step mum <malay>lebih macam</malay> say
when I was working my full time job [lah] I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so (um) ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
he also likes to count people's money (mm) <malay>macam dia cakap</malay> [oh] like your sister (mm) <malay>dia nak beli rumah dekat malaysia semua semua semua</malay> like <malay>berapa ribu</malay> [lah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he like to compare [oh] <malay>kalau</malay> your sister <malay>kerja dekat</malay> singapore the versus your (err) brother-in-law who's who <malay>kerja dekat</malay> malaysia <malay>dia punya gaji berapa berapa berapa berapa</malay>
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that [lah]
ya he no the thing is that he wants to count right after you say he will say things like can buy these can buy that <malay>sekarang</malay> can buy this can buy that and then like somehow right we will see the underlying (err) meaning <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>bila kasih</malay> I <malay>duit macam gitu</malay>
like <malay>itu yang kasih</malay> you <malay>marah</malay> because the fuck you why the fuck are you counting my money and then secondly you don't even raised me and then after that now you like what the fuck you know I mean the only good thing he has ever done in his life
was to like maybe set up a (mm) maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
the house that I'm currently living in now it's the best thing that he is evident [lah] but that also he cannot pay because he work and on and off right <malay>jadi</malay> (um) my step mum <malay>yang yang</malay> he was refusing to give
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
because he like calculative say [oh] you from the <malay>kampung</malay> you indonesian [lah] blah blah blah <malay>balik kau punya kampung</malay> blah blah blah blah blah blah <malay>kalau aku tak kahwin kau</malay>
like you <malay>punya</malay> life <malay>tak</malay> better [lah] blah blah blah blah
<malay>macam gitu sampai sekarang</malay> [tau] <malay>dia mungkir macam gitu atau dia punya fikiran</malay> [kan] I <malay>tak suka</malay>
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him [lah] even though because at one time [lah] they wanted to divorce then we we advise them [lah] like as the older children we advise them to stay together [lah] if they if they can
ya like you know this kind of thing like you count people's money you <malay>tak nak</malay> you <malay>nak duit</malay> delivered to you it just doesn't resonate with him so like and my younger brother <malay>pun macam</malay> I <malay>rasa macam dia ikut-ikut macam</malay> my <malay>bapa</malay> [tau] like <malay>dia selalu dia cakap</malay> (mm)
why are we born in a poor family
<malay>lepas tu</malay> me and my eldest sister we're like <malay>kau boleh</malay> born <malay>dalam</malay> poor family <malay>tapi kalau kau mati miskin itu kau punya</malay> problem
<malay>allah dah kasih kau banyak</malay> avenue <malay>untuk cari rezeki untuk bekerja keras kau yang tak bekerja keras kau jangan nak</malay> blame <malay>orang lain</malay>
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those (err) chinese people in society where they say [oh] I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
(um) on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
and like (err) play computer those kind of shit you know you are privileged [eh] and he doesn't realize that or acknowledge that <malay>jadi</malay> I feel like !wah! <malay>kenapa</malay> [eh] like is it because they never live through the life that the four of us live through
(mm)
ya so ya I mean I'm
<malay>tak tak tak</malay> I'm just like I'm just stress over my life in the sense where like you know when will the man in my life be useful and wake up you know everyday I fucking see them sleeping in the room watching watching youtube being fucking unproductive even though like my brother is on holiday all that shit right
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better [lah] or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know man it's like
<malay>tapi</malay> sector <malay>macam mana</malay>
I <malay>tak boleh</malay> I teach drama and english before
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
(mm) which one the the guy [ah]
ya that bastard
that is true
ya I've met a few people in my life were like those like [oh] I'm just contend with <malay>sederhana</malay> which I cannot relate to
ya but like (um) so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like (err) what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it [lah] until the time is up [ah]
book smart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
correct
<malay>poyo</malay> [siol]
(mm)
<malay>yang</malay> you <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>yang</malay> you what (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) this this answer thing is it like (um) it's like a notes for the exam [lah]
(mmhmm)
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
it is
but I would say it's because of (err) <malay>bumiputera</malay> but you are a singaporean malay you are not a malaysian malay (mm) there's a difference
(mmhmm)
ya it's so fast right your time like [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
correct because the thing is at in in
in all these places are where (um) a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like [oh] I convert
it's cheap [what] you know but the thing is at like like what I would normally tell people [lah] like I tell you before right <malay>macam kalau</malay> you <malay>nak beli benda sana kalau</malay> you <malay>tinggal dekat sana fikir macam orang sana</malay>
I <malay>keluarkan lima puluh ringgit</malay> I <malay>bayar dua puluh empat ringgit untuk</malay> shampoo is <malay>tak memadai</malay> it doesn't make sense I'd rather choose a cheaper alternative or like whatever you know
of course
(mm)
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
(mm)
<malay>dia tu yang yang itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) text you <malay>yang tanya</malay> is you
[oh]
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl

<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>sawo matang</malay> [oh] okay
<malay>kau hitam</malay>
(mm) [kan] you <malay>punya suara</malay> [kan] <malay>macam abang-abang pun</malay>
<malay>dia jadi macam apa</malay>
<malay>macam apa</malay> number one candidate <malay>untuk orang kahwin</malay> [lah]
[ah] you <malay>tak bilang</malay>
[eh] <malay>tu tak</malay> fair because like how can he choose it's supposed to be the choice of the people

ya because my childhood is spent like playing around on land and on sea not doing anything
[oh]
ya
[oh] I know why I <malay>tak tahu ini benda</malay> cause I don't sew and I <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak jahit</malay>
is that that could be the reason [oh] okay
!hais! <malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>tahu cakap pasal</malay> childhood did you
grow up most of the time in the west you did right why am I asking again ya it's always been in the west
actually me too
(um) (mmhmm)
serious [ah]
ya
never ever your family or parents wanted to or any
[oh] !wow! !wow! I <malay>tak cakap</malay> #yishun# [seh] I wanted to say to the east or the south
you know what I mean

interesting okay
live
[oh] okay
is it due to cost and expenses
do you want to talk about it is it even sensitive okay

they are raising you also and they're still
early in their marriage days
(hmm)
you raise me up okay sorry suddenly reminded of that song
I understand
you were saying ya okay priorities [lah] in that sense
like getting a house

(um) when I was in school <malay>macam</malay> doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening <malay>macam</malay> at that point of time we don't feel it [lah] obviously cause we too young
to experience it <malay>tapi</malay>
ya it's so interesting
but I guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so <malay>macam</malay> more comfortable

<malay>macam mana nak</malay> okay okay [lah] (err) maybe before that also [lah]
before that <malay>aku kerja dekat</malay> public utilities board [lah] (uh) it was ya you you know [ah]
[ah] bill <malay>air</malay> [lah] bill <malay>air</malay>
okay
so ya so that was my first job [lah] ever since <malay>aku</malay> I I've I've been working there (err) <malay>untuk enam tahun</malay> [ah] so (err) so (err)
I was in the I was doing (err) project management in their construction line [lah]
[ah]
yes
ya I I applied for (err) I I was quite lucky <malay>sebab</malay>
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> apply <malay>kerja tu</malay> and (uh)
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response [lah]
and the
[ah] ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times [lah] so
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kerja sana</malay> for <malay>enam tahun</malay>
then (err)
at at that time <malay>pun</malay>
(err) when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
then (err) I also I also same like like like you [lah] also thinking what should I do what's my career path because honestly speaking <malay>pun</malay> at that time <malay>bila aku</malay> apply <malay>itu kerja pun</malay>
<malay>aku aku
it was just a job for me
<malay>dia bukan</malay> [ah]
(uh) it's just a job for me to pay the bills [lah]
and [ah] just to
to to to earn to earn money [lah]
I rather than <malay>kau dah</malay> <malay>abeh duduk rumah tak buat apa-apa</malay> [kan] so (err) so might as well
I just took took up the job [lah] so (err) when I took up the job I <malay>aku</malay> got a lot of free time and <malay>aku pun</malay> look around <malay>aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya</malay> friends
most of them they further their studies
so <malay>aku pun fikir</malay> I think I should also do that <malay>tapi</malay> I also I also made a mistake
like <malay>aku</malay> like follow the <malay>aku</malay> follow the
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
like in a way follow the trend <malay>bukan ikut hati bukan ikut hati sendiri</malay> [ah]
[ah]
so or everyone's anytime at <malay>aku</malay> was like saying to myself [oh] everyone's furthering their studies so I should also take up a further my studies [ah] I didn't I I didn't really (err)
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay [ah] just go go go ahead with it
a degree then I I asked myself like okay what degree should I take at that time <malay>aku aku pun tak</malay> sure [lah] <malay>nak nak</malay>
<malay>nak ambil</malay> degree <malay>apa</malay> then <malay>aku cakap dengan diri aku</malay> okay since <malay>aku</malay> working in this line
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree (uh) which
is related to my work [lah] so (err) maybe (err) (err) few years down the road (err)
I <malay>apa</malay> my boss
I have good relation with my boss then they they they see an opportunity in me then is (err) <malay>kirakan</malay> (err) is one way for me to progress [lah]
down my career path [lah] in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
[oh] okay (err) I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up (uh) civil engineering ya [ah]
(err)
it it it
(err)
it's related [lah] but
(uh) not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the (err) engineering aspect [ah] it's more to the project management side
[ah] so as to be honest <malay>pun apa</malay> my diploma <malay>pun</malay> anytime time <malay>masuk</malay> poly <malay>pun</malay>
it was just like [ah]
I just take up this course [ah] it wasn't (err) (err) it wasn't it wasn't like [oh] <malay>aku</malay> passionate about this course (err) <malay>aku nak nak jadi</malay> engineer no [ah] in it was nothing like that [lah]
ya
so (err) at at that time [ah] after <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>pun</malay> ya you you should you feel lost [lah] <malay>macam apa kau nak buat dengan hidup aku</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> [ah]
so [ah]
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now [lah]
so <malay>apa ni</malay> at that time <malay>pun macam lepas</malay> <malay>pun abeh macam</malay>
even before during my poly I went for my (err) internship
so it was during my internship that that made me (err) think twice to to join the construction industry
<malay>pasal</malay>
(err) it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
(err) for my internship [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
internship <malay>aku yang</malay> really opened up my eyes <malay>yang</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] industry
[ah]
the working hours the nature of the work (uh) the work environment
(err) (err) ya
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> okay
(err)
<malay>aku</malay> don't mind [lah] telling <malay>apa</malay> telling you the story <malay>tapi</malay> if if you don't mind listening if you if you are a person who is not bored to listening to stories <malay>aku</malay> don't mind just
just sharing my my my experiences [lah]
okay okay (mm)
so (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> for my internship
ya they attach me to a local construction company
(err) so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries [lah] or you can see a big difference between a local company and (err) (err) foreign or multinational company [lah]
I (err) in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that [lah] so I was attached to a local construction company [lah]
so the first day I reported to work (err) like <malay>aku masuk dia punya</malay> office the office is a
(uh) its a container office [lah] because it's a construction site <malay>apa</malay> but this [ah] this construction site okay [lah] [ah] wasn't like those like <malay>ulu ulu punya tempat</malay> [ah]
[ah] the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a [ah]
<malay>apa ni</malay> upgrading project to a
a
a junior college [ah] so <malay>aku</malay> first day report to to the
the office <malay>aku masuk aje dia punya</malay> in the office
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
<malay>tak ada satu orang</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada satu orang pun yang macam</malay>
acknowledge
<malay>tak ada satu orang pun yang macam</malay> acknowledge <malay>aku</malay> exist in
in their office ya that was that was how I felt [lah]
and the the first person who acknowledged me <malay>kau tahu siapa</malay>

<malay>bila aku</malay> happy <malay>kerja</malay>
<malay>aku</malay>
didn't didn't thought had that in mind [lah]
and <malay>aku pun</malay> so it it gave me like
(err) doubts [lah] <malay>aku pun</malay> like
did I make the right move <malay>ke tak</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean
<malay>apa</malay> it doesn't really matter also [lah]
ya so
just went along [lah] <malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>aku pun fikir balik</malay> like
(err) ya what he say really (err) <malay>apa</malay> like
(err)
[ah] like
[ah] <malay>tak bedek</malay> [ah] but
and it also [ah]
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks [ah] <malay>abeh aku pun fikir balik macam</malay> [sial] [ah] <malay>aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak</malay> resign [oh] just
because <malay>aku nak nak nak</malay> listen to that guy [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> you
you just made do with what you have [ah] you just make do with what you have <malay>memang betul</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> the the at that at that time my my nature of work
you need to have some technical knowledge [lah] which I was lacking [ah]
(err) with the engineering the in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking [ah]
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad [ah]
like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas [lah]
so
[ah]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya ya
so ya (err)
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
it didn't turn out quite that bad also <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
[ah] consultants usually they provide the technical (err) aspect [ah]
so (err) when when when whenever you
<malay>macam</malay> you're not sure from a technical point of view you I can always refer to the consultants [ah] so
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
<malay>abeh</malay> (err) from
from <malay>aku punya</malay> nature of work <malay>pun</malay> project management <malay>pun</malay> what what I
what I
what was more on the soft skills
<malay>pasal</malay>
back then <malay>pun aku</malay> wasn't really a
a a <malay>apa ni</malay> I'm
I am a very quiet guy [lah] <malay>aku</malay> not those person go around talk talk to people I mean I still am
but
[ah] when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it [lah]
[ah]
so so ya you <malay>aku aku</malay>
improve on my soft skills and then <malay>dekat</malay> (err) during my course of work <malay>pun</malay> there like what I told you [ah] who decided to further my studies take up
a a
a degree [lah] then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
(err) previously was unisim now they call it [ah]
ya so
then you decided not to
okay [ah]
good for you [lah] good for you I mean
[ah] ya so
I took up
(err) my part-time degree
like I told you before [lah] <malay>apa aku</malay> time <malay>ambil</malay> degree <malay>pun</malay> was like
[oh] everyones
doing a degree I should also do a degree <malay>tapi</malay>
at that time ya like
(uh) <malay>aku</malay> was just following the trend [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> now now <malay>aku fikir balik</malay> I shouldn't have do that [lah] I mean ya I you should still take up a degree but then
really take up a degree in what really interest you [ah]
and (uh) what you really want to do [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> that time
(mm) (mm)
ya
<malay>apa</malay> (err)
since you say it like that <malay>pada aku</malay> in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in [ah] so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay (um) which I agree [lah] which a degree is not really [ah] <malay>apa</malay> a need [ah]
in the industry because your industry (uh)
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
<malay>tapi untuk aku</malay>
when <malay>aku</malay> did my degree (uh)
(err) <malay>aku</malay> did my degree while while working [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> as years go by [eh]
<malay>aku kat kerja aku</malay> like
<malay>aku tengok aku punya sama</malay> [ah] like
work environment <malay>pun</malay>
(uh) with the the the
bosses like
<malay>aku</malay> tell myself [sial] [ah] <malay>aku aku aku</malay> don't see myself
doing this long term
like [ah] so like
<malay>aku tengok aku punya</malay> bosses [eh] like
<malay>macam</malay> (err)
<malay>dia orang ada takde pun macam beza</malay> [sia]
like they are just like <malay>pasal</malay> okay
(uh) we are a big
organisation [kan] like ya we have a <malay>apa</malay> like (uh)
<malay>tapi</malay> stat board they call it [lah]
and then they got their directors [lah] and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy [ah]
when <malay>kau pun</malay> <malay>pun</malay> you should know [ah] [kan] hierarchy [ah] it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like <malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>kau kat bawah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau nak kena dengar kata dia ni abeh dia ni kadang-kadang tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh buat</malay> decision <malay>abeh kau nak kena</malay>
(err) <malay>lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena</malay>
<malay>go through dia kau nak kena go through orang atas dia</malay>
<malay>abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu</malay> decision <malay>orang atas dia lagi</malay>
I mean <malay>kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka</malay>
<malay>orang bawah abeh dia orang bertekak abeh kau kat bawah</malay>
like <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> like
<malay>kau orang</malay> (err) <malay>kau orang</malay> cannot make a decision <malay>abeh aku nak kena buat apa</malay> [siol]
like sometimes the conflict like
<malay>bertahun-tahun lepas punya</malay> [sia]
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like [eh] !siala! <malay>kau orang dari dulu</malay> [eh] <malay>abeh sampai sekarang</malay>
more like <malay>pada aku</malay> it's not healthy [ah] <malay>abeh abeh macam aku</malay> like <malay>kat situ</malay> [eh] <malay>aku kerja situ</malay> like !siala! <malay>macam aku kalau</malay> stay <malay>sini aku tak nak</malay> [sia] end up <malay>macam kau orang</malay> ya I mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true [ah] <malay>aku</malay>
dispute it [lah] <malay>apa</malay> (err) government really iron rice bowl [lah] as in like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally [ah] living a comfortable life [ah]
but <malay>aku</malay> just don't see myself doing that long term [ah]
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to

took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
as you grow older time kau akan rasa</malay> time is like you you will feel the time pressure [lah]
like you are running out of time [ah] so

we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
and then <malay>apa</malay> that was

to go ahead with it <malay>aku</malay> look up <malay>ada ada aku aku</malay> just look up on google [lah] of of [ah] media courses [ah] <malay>abeh aku fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>

we are are we
<malay>aku dah</malay> like that five years [eh] <malay>aku pun</malay> like like like <malay>macam</malay> in a way like <malay>macam</malay> drag myself to to finish it [ah]
<malay>abeh</malay> (err)
<malay>lepas tu aku sekarang nak</malay> go into media industry <malay>kalau aku nak ambil</malay> degree <malay>aku nak kena</malay>

<malay>aku</malay> was like !siala! five years of study <malay>dah dah macam dah cukup</malay> [ah] like [ah] enough of studying [ah] [sia] [ah] enough of studying [ah] I mean
[ah] <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak</malay> take up another degree
another three years of degree for media <malay>abeh aku</malay> just look out <malay>aku tengok</malay> mediacorp offer offer
this is but it's a diploma [ah] it's just a one year course okay [lah] one year <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> okay [lah] <malay>masih boleh</malay> take it [lah] one year okay [lah] so I I I I grabbed it [ah]
then (err) <malay>aku pun</malay>
at that time was
was so was want to
transition into the media industry [kan] so <malay>aku</malay> like thought of (err) maybe (err) take a gap year first [ah] before <malay>aku</malay> joined the media industry
so (uh) <malay>apa aku</malay>
was planning to take my gap year which was this year <malay>aku</malay> (uh) already plan to go to new zealand
[ah] there's this
(err)
it's called a [ah]
a working holiday if you heard of it [ah] basically I basically it's it's a holiday <malay>tapi</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau boleh</malay> you can apply for a job there
but [ah] but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs [lah] it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs <malay>ataupun</malay> part-time jobs are those kind of jobs [ah] ya [ah] so
and then the new zealand (err) working holiday is is a visa [lah] basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
(err) the visa is for six months
so (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err)
(err)
<malay>kalau</malay> there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
<malay>pasal</malay> [ah] their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry <malay>kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam</malay> singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
(uh) is that horticulture industry [lah]
so they they make use of this (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err) backpackers foreigners to come to to to (err) holiday
and (err) at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday <malay>apa</malay> so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry [ah] so <malay>aku</malay>

actually it's true [lah] actually mac can last quite long if you take care of it properly
I don't know why people say <malay>macam</malay> [oh] mac [oh] apple is like
it's so expensive but then they only last for a long time [eh] for a short time
I mean like I feel like that's like
one of the things no [meh] but like
actually [oh] [oh] [oh] it's just ya its it's windows <malay>punya</malay> vibe [lah]
it's just not high class ya ya ya it's so like when you think of windows you think of cheap plastic square boxy like
humpty dumpty brown frumpy but apple is lit apple is <malay>macam</malay> clean modern ya so if the listener is using [ah] windows sorry about that
androids couldn't beat me [lah] it's just what I would say
think apple is the future
[ah] shopping
ya
(um) now let's move to next topic
my wish list [eh] (hmm) actually [kan] [oh] you know what okay so just now I had my free tweet [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> childhood ya cause I ya [lah]
do you know like in like
twitter account I don't need no I don't this is my like (uh) local account
okay well ya it's fine
anyway anyway ya it's very dead [lah] cause I don't tweet a lot I only retweet retweet <malay>gitu</malay> and <malay>itu pun macam</malay> when my K pop account is dead ya so then I switch to the local but them (um)
so I tweeted
(uh) once in a blue moon can and then today was a blue moon so I tweeted that
how I realise that I like
pastel colours and
I had a happy moment cause I was just like
I'm thinking of colour combinations so speaking of that ya ya but also like things [lah] like
objects or like the interior design I think it's so pretty like for example <malay>macam</malay> a light pastel mint green with pink
I think that's really nice like purple ya one combination
yes girl !huh! no I don't like gucci I don't want gucci bag I don't think you're joking
[oh]
maybe it's nice to me [ah] cause I like now apparently I have awakening
[oh] I think it's it's a statement [lah] it's not an everyday
I think it could be cute technically
anyway so now I blah blah blah
I realize I like pastel colours then I was thinking of outfits and then I went to pinterest and then I was like [oh] and then wanted to taste like [oh] what I feel like I need purple jeans like lilac jeans
and like I see people wear and like not bad [oh] my god [oh] my god so I went to carousell and buy
was dumb
purple jeans and then ya that was why like you know that the pre order china time
for seventeen dollars so might buy that no I haven't yet like twenty five
okay white okay and another darker shade of purple on top
(um) I can simply buy it no problem I can wear with my green tops
it's the way to go it's the new mix match
<malay>apa kau merepek</malay>
okay [lah] barney is just
figment of imagination anyway ya and when the kids grow up their imagination dies
but there are new kids
<malay>macam</malay> (um) theory <malay>apa itu</malay>
ya but but <malay>dulu mana ada cakap pasal</malay> barney <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] maybe like K one maybe <malay>ada</malay> but I don't think it's about barney barney brigade
anyway ya
purple and yellow
I mean it's not like <malay>macam</malay> I mean even if it's yellow or like this green right it's not just yellow green it's like how you balance it maybe it's like a yellow jacket or
a yellow detail you know it's about those things delay fashion
(uh) you need to be coached
really
well ya so that was like
live wish list ya purple pants ya but I don't really have any other wish list
like
maybe that that <malay>apa</malay> (err)
[oh] ya crocs
ya ya
I don't really have
jewellery jewellery jewellery jewellery
like it doesn't give me the also my place got a lot already
and my rings like
I got one more but they have to match with the other the thing is that's a bit hard
for my birthday present ring you know
you don't know
the one that's a bit too big and then like it all jam ya ya ya ya ya that one is pretty but I find it hard I don't know where to wear
I mean ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> the the organization <malay>macam</malay> how it flows
ya well I <malay>tak tahu</malay> either [lah] but it's just how it fits
yes the vibes
!huh! get a little vibes [eh] [eh] ya actually <malay>ini banyak macam</malay> I don't know <malay>macam</malay> how to

basic [eh] <malay>macam ikut</malay> everyone
but then there's must be some kind of
you don't have (err) aesthetic [lah] I think you know [what]
I think you do have aesthetic just have to find out what it is I think as for now it's a bit like no no no no no no no don't first of all it's not bad I think it's like <malay>macam</malay>
(err)
a bit of minimalism
<malay>macam</malay> minimalistic and also you know like the black rare of <malay>macam</malay> gossip girl kind of vibes

and (um) I'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then (um)
because #johor# has (err) strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because (err) the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if #johor# (um) numbers demote back [ah] but I think after a week it does in its red zone
(mm)
ya I still have my dirt bike to go [oh] my god

we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the the the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then I think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
(err) ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve you see ya just say twelve so
I was texting I was texting the dirt bike organiser I was like !hey! I get this (um) news about your government closing down the borders blah blah so how how is it now then she says that okay

isolate ourselves [lah] but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks
so I'm like and the cases in europe [ah]

that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
(um) we are having this thing we call circuit circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask

[eh] D <malay>dah lama tak jumpa</malay> (uh) <malay>awak sekarang tengah buat apa ni</malay>
<malay>tak ada kerja</malay>
!alamak! (uh) lynn <malay>sekarang tengah kerja kat</malay> catering kitchen [ah] <malay>buat kerja</malay> part time <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak kerja</malay> (uh) I <malay>boleh ajak</malay> you <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] <malay>awak nak tak</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah] ya ya ya I remember her
(mmhmm)
!alamak! <malay>kesian</malay>
[oh] really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
(mm) I'm not so sure I think you can do some (uh) admin job duties I know in my workplace (uh) sometimes we have (um) we need we get orders from customers for #bentos# or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to (uh) hire someone for the time being especially during this period [lah]
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
(mm) I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay #hijabis# not (uh) not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this (um) poll [lah] (uh) asking whether like have any of us malay #hijabis# ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset [lah] like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
[oh]
(mm)
!wah!
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry (uh) for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab (err) restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried [oh] let's say what if the medicine or anything like
<malay>kena</malay> the hijab then later got stains all those germs [mah] so maybe they might be concerned with that but then I think they can always (uh) how to say they can prepare like a modified version of the hijab such that it not only helps to protect the muslim nurses but it also allows them to do their job right I think that is one way that they can do and I know that recently they have been talking about that
and I think in social media it has been blowing up [ah] but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay [lah] [ha]

standing near this guy from school of engineering so (uh) I was like his shirt quite cute [eh] he wear spider-man shirt then I was like [oh] I like your shirt it looks cute then he was like [oh] thank you then after that (um) suddenly (uh)
we were doing some other things [ah] so after the block visit right we were sitting down then after that he was like playing with the cat obviously I went to him but not because of him [lah] I went to the cat cause I like cats [mah] so I was like playing with the cat I was then suddenly we were like talking and talking cause like we both like cats so we like started talking [lah]
and then he said (uh) can we exchange numbers cause you know for the (uh) final year project I was like okay [lah] I mean he's not like the main committee but I was like okay [lah] why not maybe at least can update him and stuff then after that from then right he keep messaging me on telegram on whatsapp and then during that period right (uh) what is that movie [ah] marvel is it not star wars <malay>apa</malay> movie <malay>tu yang</malay> viral
the I love you three thousand a lot a lot of people say [ah] end game whatever the heck that movie is [lah]

the way I kind of broke contact with him was a bit harsh [lah] because I remember at that time we had another block visit then after that he was like messaging me late at night I think it was around eleven plus so I told him [oh] (err) I want to go and pray first [lah] then he was like okay after you pray text me [ah] then after that I ignore him already

<malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>I macam malas nak taip</malay> okay so SIRI suppose to be the convenient option right it's suppose to be more convenient it's suppose to bring more convenience to your life <malay>tapi</malay> it's like double job [ah] I I I don't mind it honestly I don't mind it <malay>tapi</malay> you you <malay>yang selalu macam</malay>
babe you might as well just
type it in and then like I don't know then it doesn't it doesn't become fun anymore you know
but still I like
ya I guess I wonder if can actually if people were to really use SIRI
for their day to day like everything is SIRI [seh] because I think they have like like google home or like alexa right those I think those ones are a bit more receptive a bit more <malay>macam</malay> how do I say like (err) they can do more commands maybe but for SIRI <malay>macam</malay> everything <malay>tak boleh</malay>

I hope <malay>dorang macam</malay> it's it doesn't become like one of those (err) you know the movie her
like okay okay so the this guy [eh] okay I kind of forgot what he does or whatever but the essence of the story is that he (err) <malay>macam</malay> fell in love with the so <malay>macam</malay> because the became <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> like the only companion that he had or not maybe not only companion but the one that he feels <malay>paling faham</malay> like <malay>paling</malay> understanding
something like that like so <malay>dia macam</malay>
ya I guess so so he ended up falling in love with the but the is not capable [lah] to love him back so it like it became like a
very (err) <malay>macam</malay>
existential crisis kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> [oh] no what's going to happen to me whatever whatever so ya that's kind of cool
(mm) true

(err) you know what's weird like (err) I've been to concerts <malay>dekat</malay> big box and I feel ya

empty space
you know like there's the stage and and and all but it's like a standing pit [ah] I guess then
no but maybe maybe different concerts different but I think I've been to two concerts there and both the concerts is (err) like standing and I think it's weird because <malay>macam</malay>
#jurong# is not like okay #jurong# could be the town area of the west
maybe
kind of like JEM you know westgate like all the the malls there <malay>tapi macam</malay> to have a concert like the the the artist from wherever they are flying from they will be travelling
to #jurong# so they will feel like you know like I I guess you get the real or like you get a sense of like (err) a bit more <malay>macam</malay> authentic singapore but
like weird [lah] to have a concert there cause it's like <malay>sebelah dia</malay> is like furniture shop you know the furniture shop <malay>tempat makan</malay> I guess <malay>macam</malay> what
like on a daily is it [orh]
it's like you ya you have to <malay>buat</malay> research <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] like you cannot straightaway
(mm)
what
[oh] really shell out
ya I don't
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is it in the the food court or is it like <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tempat makan</malay> on its own
[oh] [oh] like I I probably have been to that food court and the food court that okay the the stall that I love so much <malay>dekat sana</malay> is
(um)
the #naan# [oh] my god the indian food <malay>dia punya</malay> #naan# is I think two dollar fifty and <malay>sedap gila</malay> and like the <malay>dia punya</malay> [ah] butter chicken <malay>macam tak tak</malay> [ah] <malay>lokek</malay> super <malay>sedap</malay>
I know <malay>macam dengar</malay> you <malay>punya mulut macam berair liur macam</malay> you know
(mm)
ya that's true
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
not for more than just <malay>satu</malay> occasion ya
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[oh] okay <malay>pasal</malay> like it's every <malay>macam</malay> not say it's everywhere it's like it's not just one specific place where all #kurtas# are it's like everything is everywhere ya I get it
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
and <malay>mahal gila</malay> like <malay>kita pula dia</malay>
how much was your #kurta#
okay
still okay
(mm)
[oh] <malay>murahnya</malay> you shouldn't gotten that [one]
ya
okay <malay>kedai apa</malay> because I <malay>pernah makan dekat</malay> #tekka# <malay>punya</malay> market and there's a certain stall <malay>yang sedap</malay> also like it's not bad
is it <malay>dekat</malay> entrance you know there's the bus stop
escalator escalator
ya
I <malay>menang</malay> [seh]
ya so I <malay>macam</malay> very competitive
and like <malay>macam</malay> you know like like it's time I win something or more among your friends
so I had to win that game
or actually not had to win that game is like whatever opportunity I I <malay>boleh</malay> I <malay>akan menang</malay> [lah] but it was it was fun I love I love hanging out with your friends
(mm)
(mm) like honestly same to me <malay>macam</malay> I'm not really surrounded with people <malay>yang</malay>
really play a lot of board games at home or my own friends they don't really do that but I feel like ever since I met your friends <malay>dorang</malay> like are really
I don't know maybe if it's in their nature <malay>yang dorang</malay> not the most (err) not say friendly not the most social <malay>macam</malay>
in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games (err) and this just brought me back to
early times [ah] I guess
ya but not a lot like I it only I think only this year then I learn how to play monopoly <malay>betul-betul</malay> ya (err) before that I <malay>tak tahu sangat macam mana nak main</malay> monopoly deal also I <malay>tak tahu main</malay>
(mm)
this is the thing okay the only thing I played [eh] a board games <malay>macam betul-betulnya</malay> board games <malay>macam</malay> meaning you are the board <malay>macam</malay> not card games or whatever first okay <malay>kita</malay> just board games was the game of life
I I think <malay>masih ada kat rumah</malay> but I have to find it
(um) the game of life is basically
okay everyone will start at a point where okay <malay>kau nak belajar ke kau nak</malay>
[ah] start <malay>kerja</malay> straight it's literally like this it's literally life decisions [ah] that will make you ponder about what to do next <malay>tapi dia macam</malay> fast forward <malay>gila</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> after maybe a few turns you <malay>dah</malay> graduate [lah] (err) then for those <malay>yang macam dah</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> after a few turns towards the ending you <malay>dah ada anak</malay> you know you <malay>dah</malay> get married you <malay>dah ada anak</malay> so it's like it's very fast <malay>tapi</malay> it's quite fun (err) so that's the game of life
no I've never played that also when I was young so snake and ladders was only because your friends you know <malay>macam</malay> introduced me to board games and shit !oops! sorry (err) introduced me to board games [eh] I wanted to [ah] bring that board games to
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
officially like official game rules I don't know how to play like to me <malay>macam</malay> snake <malay>naik atas ke turun</malay> I don't know [ah] ladders <malay>boleh turun ke naik atas</malay> you know like I don't know which one is which (err) I don't know proper dice rules also <malay>macam</malay> (err) you know like if you (um)(ppo) get the same ya exactly or snake and ladders I think <malay>cuma ada satu</malay> dice <malay>satu</malay> die so so you get six you can go another turn that kind of thing ya like I don't know I don't know so it was that was the first time also I played with my friends (um) but before that so there was the game of life when I was younger
and then there was
<malay>dia macam</malay> aeroplane [eh] ya I I <malay>ingat</malay> and I think I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>pernah main juga</malay> but I <malay>tak pernah</malay>
like research how to <malay>main betul-betul</malay> ya
(mm)
like <malay>kita</malay> lend or <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> will put into groups and play I don't know but pick up sticks was one of my favourites also like I love to play that game
pick up sticks
ya
it's the one <malay>yang</malay> you cannot move the thing right
why
okay okay okay okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like maybe a a certain colour has the most point
whatever it is okay [lah] some people will think strategically <malay>dorang nak amek</malay> the one with the highest points some people are like just take as much as you can and accumulate all the points
so but whatever it is okay it will start with how to explain it [eh] all the sticks in one hand okay and only one person does this <malay>dah</malay> one hand and then <malay>dorang</malay> just <malay>lepaskan</malay> that's it
so
I think is I think as many I don't know [lah] but like only one person have to do that and then <malay>dia lepaskan</malay> [kan] so it's like everywhere right scattered ya so like each person just have to take one by one [lah]
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
(mm)
ya which is okay <malay>tapi</malay> sometimes even the one at the top can <malay>tergoyangkan yang</malay> the other one
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then [eh] ya
[oh] ya ya ya
okay I <malay>tahu</malay> about that ball I don't know what you do with that ball like <malay>macam</malay> is it supposed to be a throwing game or what but yes I do remember that paper ball yes
(mm)
I
[oh] #congkak# yes
for a moment I <malay>macam</malay>
in my whole life I <malay>tak pernah cakap tu dekat siapa-siapa</malay> so <malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>cakap tu dekat</malay> you I <malay>tak tahu main</malay> #chapteh# no (err) I I think I'm pretty bad at #chapteh# (err) for people who can play what's that called <malay>yang</malay> the #sepak takraw# I salute like cause it's kind of similar right you <malay>pakai kaki</malay> like flick the thing up like I think #sepak takraw# is harder than football or soccer ya so I ya I really really salute people who can play #sepak takraw#
[ah] but side track back to what we which one were we talking about which game
#congkak# yes I actually really like #congkak#
okay
I I I think it's better if you play it and also this recording is going to be vet by other people I <malay>tak tahu kalau</malay> the rules <malay>betul ke tak</malay> completely <malay>tapi</malay> basically like [ah] I I really want to play with you like this game so maybe I think we should get but okay #congkak# gives me this memory from primary school okay so primary school ya let's go way back in primary school
<malay>kita ada</malay> this one corner
where it's like a #kampung# where it's design and and like (err) painted in a way that looks like a #kampung# so there was like hopscotch on the floor there were games here and there
ya (err) ya I'm trying to think whether my primary school was like a
ya I was from woodlands [lah] so
<malay>macam kampung-kampung</malay> [eh] like but okay
(mm)
ya ya
(err) with the steps as well like it was like (err) I don't know how to explain [ah] okay paint wall right to look like the house right and there's like a platform with the steps to make it look like you <malay>tengah naik atas</malay> the ya to the to the <malay>macam</malay> what's that call like a patio <malay>luar</malay> the #kampung# like outside part of the house
okay ya the <malay>serambi</malay> and then like you know okay so over there they will like not say cabinets [ah] like shelves of games you can play so #congkak# was one of them
(mm)
like something similar right okay [lah] <malay>dah tak</malay> special
(mm) ya something like that ya ya ya (mm)
yes yes that [one] is like the spider spider plastic spider
ya that [one] never play before
so [oh] that [one] also <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> eraser
the ya
(err) I never played but there was a point where like I would have a few of the country <malay>punya</malay> flags [ah]
[oh] ya it's always like the hardest to find [eh] singapore (err) but I never had singapore <malay>punya</malay> flag
how
okay yes correct but that's like the cheating way
ya [oh] my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] !wow! <malay>apa tu</malay> it's like a what subscription box of erasers you don't know what you're going to get but each month you get or each week you pay
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay
entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working [ah] full time right now (um) in an office I work in an office job for a business school
(um) so I'm just giving you a bit of context [lah] [eh] (um) I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
(um) and hopefully it will happen [lah] but till then <malay>macam</malay> it's not my biggest priority as of this moment because I feel like you know I want to be at a <malay>macam</malay> okay there are different goals that I want to achieve in life and right now that's not like what I want to achieve at this point
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's (err) and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
(mm) cause I think (err) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) in any company in any business there's going to be a loss you know but I feel like if I lose now it's too much of a loss ya so I want to be a bit more comfortable first and then
the company
no like (err) <malay>macam</malay> I understand this is a goal that I want in the future
but if I want to push that goal forward I cannot do it now like I don't think I can ya ya maybe <malay>macam</malay> the planning [lah] planning maybe <malay>boleh</malay>
but <malay>macam kalau</malay> I <malay>nak buat sekarang</malay> execute everything <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I can yet
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that (err) sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
or your you know like you whatever it is you can still sell or whatever or you can still find the next big thing the next idea like but it's on you [lah] someone can have the same product but they cannot sell as good as you for example you know so I'm not too worried I do I do understand that <malay>macam kita dah</malay> discuss the idea we really love it we we think that you know this could be something
but I think for now no [lah]
SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business [eh]
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already (um) on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
(um) tutorials to her starting vlogs to then her <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> her own [ah] no no not <malay>buka</malay> [ah] she collab with major makeup companies
so that's like the starting right like the first step is like collabs right and then after doing the collabs and she actually collaborated <malay>dengan</malay> this <malay>satu</malay> sunglasses company
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
(um) like her story
[ah] okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
[ah] like she gave birth to both her babies but ocean ya it's very nice but (err) that's not my <malay>macam</malay>
my number one idol when it comes to business
(err) I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
(err) ya ya fenty fenty became
a household name like okay like <malay>macam</malay> everyone knew fenty as like her name fenty rihanna robyn
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya [oh] no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
such a global phenomenon <malay>macam</malay> and it's because [kan] like she had the okay business is business you get money money is whatever you know like that's the goal of any business to make money to make profits right <malay>tapi</malay> the way she did it [eh] because she started with the makeup and the makeup brand the way she did it was
inclusivity was diversity was <malay>macam</malay> (err)
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
<malay>macam</malay> maybe you know there are certain shades that doesn't match her or certain (um) products that are not the most friendliest to <malay>macam</malay> that kind of skin tone
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable [lah] so ever since that that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products [ah] like companies that she made
was probably like years in the making as well it's just that starting with that as the first business <malay>macam</malay> like it really
like gave her so much respect in that
like (err) area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then (um) she also has
(err) like a luxury line which I forgot [ah] I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're !wow! this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business (mm)
I I think what success is
is like maybe [lah] for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
as the main thing that I'm doing in my life <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>dah tak payah kerja dekat</malay> office I
<malay>dah macam</malay> my family is taking care of
like all those kind of worries <malay>dah tak ada</malay> and all I can focus on is my business
like I think to me that is success
but it's more of a personal thing it's not <malay>macam</malay> the company success you know maybe the company success is to get returns <malay>macam</malay> to get return customers maybe that's one way of like (um) success but for me is a personal thing when it comes to my own business is that [ah]
(mm) (mm)
hundred K you <malay>nak tahu tak kenapa</malay> I <malay>tanya tu</malay> <malay>sebab kat</malay> instagram I wish I wish <malay>tak</malay> [lah] but okay actually
it's not a scam like I I I'm very particular when it comes to like the things that we see online right but so instagram there's this account and I'm still trying to understand actually so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>boleh faham</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> try to explain to me [ah] so there's this account that is called curated business curated businesses okay that's the handle how I found out about this was kendall [eh] kylie jenner posted a post of her with luxury bags saying you can win this plus seventy K
and if it comes from kylie jenner it has to be like you know legit right so okay so the steps were that you have to follow curated business and scott disick scott disick is the the [ah] kourtney #kardashian# <malay>punya</malay>
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
okay so you have to follow and it was like seventy plus accounts seventy five I think so you you have to follow all of those and then just comment like like (err) the question was who are you going to share this seventy K with so all you had to do was (um) answer in the comments section who and just follow the businesses which I think it's a way to increase [kan] like real people you see it's not bought followers it's like real people <malay>punya</malay> accounts <malay>tapi</malay> the moment the giveaway is done <malay>orang akan</malay> unfollow [ah]
but it's just that like <malay>kalau orang tu terlupa</malay> then maybe the account is still there
ya go ahead
yes
(mm)
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so (um)
(um) the account was giving seventy K seventy K
okay so <malay>lepas ni semua orang</malay> so seventy K plus like all the bags [tau] plus [tau] it's like and it's open internationally so like I wanted to see how legit it is again they have winners from different parts of the world they have from japan they have from mexico they have from
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus (err) the iphone new iphone
so it's like it's cool [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>menang</malay> you <malay>menang</malay> you <malay>tak menang</malay> you <malay>tak menang</malay> [ah] so I ask you that because I <malay>macam</malay> if I really <malay>menang</malay> what am I going to do like
I
it's one of those things where you won't know until it actually happens you know or like you can think about it but will it happen this kind of thing so <malay>macam</malay> and some the person who won was from
I don't know I think it's the states [ah] florida or something it's not me [ah] they they said the results on friday I checked <malay>tak ada</malay> notification ya but ya like so (um)
[oh] I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to (err) to (um) settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
!wow! fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty (mm)
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have
ya
(mmhmm)
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
I I think singapore quite <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] like
because the bags were different sizes <malay>macam</malay> there are some like the smaller ones there are like bigger like
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there [lah] but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell [lah]
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why [ah] you you ask me that before
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>seorang wanita yang suka</malay>
[oh] okay bag bag <malay>beg-beg apa</malay> what's like the
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach [ah] and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
and then there was a point whenever I tweeted something <malay>macam</malay> my mum works at coach <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] then someone indirected me and said coach is the bossini giordano of luxury brands so that's when I <malay>macam</malay> okay I got to humble down but no but basically like (um) I haven't heard [lah] ya we're not representing it's just experiences personal
okay but anyway ya so I <malay>ni tak pernah masuk macam</malay>
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
(mm)
<malay>sebab orang-orang dekat dalam macam sombong sikit</malay>[ah] and very judgemental
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like [oh] I can afford this you know like so it comes with it [lah]
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay sure
(mm)
(err) I don't know man I don't know <malay>dia punya</malay> price list [seh] like I think <malay>satu</malay> handbag [eh]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> like
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
<malay>empat ribu</malay> probably gets you the small zip (hmm) probably the small one small bag
maybe I don't know I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tak pernah</malay> so
[ah] the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine
(hmm)
I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours
ya and we don't know if they are getting paid much more
ya in a in a in a way yes
go frontliners shout out
(mm)
you not actually nurse
just <malay>macam</malay> whether or not you'll be (mm)
I think you can
I think you will make a good nurse
I think you can
can you
<malay>macam banyak darah</malay>
no let's not talk about that but I don't have [lah]
<malay>macam banyak banyak</malay>
okay
wait I wanted to share something but I think that's not best to be shared okay nevermind moving forward
(mm) nurse [eh] maybe maybe I don't think I would good news
ya true
do they have to go to medical school
to be a doctor
I don't know
wait what are we doing with our lives I think it's
doctorate [lah]
doctorate degree
(mm)
<malay>kenapa cina</malay>
doctor #fazil#
doctorate
I <malay>tak ingat sangat tapi</malay>
and doctorate is like
cause okay the only reason why I <malay>betuk-betul tahu</malay> there's a difference is that remember there's a comedy that we watched the the one the (err) the doctor from
ya then he make fun of the people there early on he he's like he's like (err)
I believe there are some (err) owners here as well how you all get in this [one] have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further [lah] I don't know
no no cause <malay>macam</malay> the people who listening to this probably <malay>dorang biol</malay> like you know
like we generally don't know okay we're sorry but
general practitioner !wow!
[ah] [ah]
ya
ya ya ya ya
!wah! bullshit
ya
a doctorate
ya ya ya ya exactly so the the the doctor <malay>punya</malay> salutation that's given it's not medical
ya like
(err) okay I work in a business school you know and I have I have a (err) not lecturer what's it call like a professor whose name is doctor C J maddox but she doesn't take medical she's in business ya doctor C J maddox doctor #banu# doctor shout out to all the business school teachers
I understand <malay>macam</malay> it's not something <malay>kita</malay> (um)
see for ourselves you know it's not a goal or like
like something we want [ah] basically not something we want for ourselves it is understandable <malay>kalau</malay> like you <malay>tak tahu</malay> the only reason I <malay>tahu</malay> is because of that comedy and I work in a business school like that it <malay>kalau</malay> I don't I don't know (mm)
<malay>apa kita tahu</malay> is just <malay>main</malay> game
ya <malay>kita nak main</malay> monopoly after this actually
(mm) game of life is not bad so they actually gave give you a wheel to spin it's not a dice
singlish (err) it's not that fun [lah]
it's okay [lah]
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know
no
capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
sorry <malay>kita</malay> curse <malay>banyak</malay> [seh]
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
<malay>tapi</malay> I trust you [lah] don't worry about that [oh]
nice
[oh] well you manipulated me
okay (err) in order to be my friend you don't have to laugh at everything I say it's just that <malay>macam</malay> that is a plus point [lah]
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward (err) ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
(um)
no
(err) <malay>kentang</malay> the way I say it <malay>kentang goreng kentang</malay> <malay>kentang kentang</malay> okay like the question shouldn't be what do I like eating it should be what do you not like eating cause like I can eat anything else except for these foods so it's like
I don't like beef unfortunately <malay>sebab</malay> to me <malay>macam</malay> a bit
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
in terms of food but we'll why because <malay>kalau dah nak keluar makan</malay>
ya but I've I've never said guys I don't eat beef can we not go here like I've never said that because that's very rare that a <malay>tempat</malay> will only sell that and there's nothing for me ya
ya like steak house probably still has like ya <malay>ayam</malay> (err) <malay>ikan semua</malay> okay (err) so ya I think it's still pretty okay
(mm) food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
(mm)
just that andes andes <malay>sedap gila</malay> and
ya okay so I'm pretty sure everyone thinks it's called andes but <malay>kita</malay> actually <malay>dengar</malay> waiter <malay>cakap</malay> andes so
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but (um) ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya [lah] we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference !aww! but (err) I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person [ah] but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
so <malay>macam</malay> usually if I go through anything that's not
(um) like the best of times for me I would share it with the certain people like my boyfriend like (um)
maybe some like close friends as well so
so it like <malay>macam</malay> it reduces that (err)
that
stress [ah] to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders [ah] it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and (err)
that is not a good thing also <malay>jangan berhutang-hutang orang</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> (err) what I think you're asking is more like
will they be down for you like will they be there for you and <malay>macam</malay> really support you in times of need yes
(mmhmm)
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
<malay>macam</malay> (mm) there's pros and cons you know having a friend like that I feel like
probably would put you in check a bit more
(err) but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
(err) I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you (um) sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

(hmm)
okay [lah] #pika#
[oh]
wait you talking about cat [kan] (uh) <malay>aku buka tingkap bilik aku tadi</malay>
[eh] you saw what you saw

[orh] I'm okay [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> lately <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] because (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> COVID [kan] so I cannot work so most of the time I stay at home then I just watch Netflix
<malay>atau</malay> just (uh) watch new dramas [lah] basically
ya
what's your favourite
ya ya ya ya
correct correct then the one that I regret the most <malay>sekarang</malay> is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> the one that you invited me to watch [ah] demon slayer
ya
(uh) because the thing is like (uh) when I first saw the trailer
for me personally right [ah] (uh) <malay>aku bukan</malay> a fan of <malay>apa ni macam</malay> cute cute (uh) type of (err) art style for the (err) anime for me I prefer like <malay>macam</malay> semi realistic so the ones I watch is like initial D but when I watch demon slayer on myself
I regret <malay>gila</malay> serious because it's like (uh) the storyline <malay>bagus</malay> and then like <malay>dia punya</malay> action scenes also was quite good and then I was really blown away [ah] so like aw shit I semi regret seriously I should have started earlier cause by the time I started right (uh) it was
I was quite behind the hype already [lah] in a way
ya
(um)
[orh] okay
ya because (uh)
when I started (uh) I think I don't know how like (err) I was in cause I think (um) a lot of people watch already but [ah] even then when I watch later the hype was still there so (err) the main thing for me it's just I can't wait for season two so (uh) I haven't started yet but I'm going to try watch the #manga# [eh] I I'm gonna read the #manga# sorry not watch ya but it was really good [lah] ya
(mm)
then it ended
[orh] september
[oh] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
[oh] one shot [ah]
rise up [ah] ya
ya
(mm) (mm)
#naruto#
[ah]
(mm)
ya
that's why but (err) but (err) adding on to <malay>yang</malay> the older <malay>punya</malay> #animes# even initial D <malay>pun</malay> [kan] it started in nineteen ninety five it didn't reach that much so like so like the fact that it's brand new then <malay>macam</malay> it got so much hype and like so much (um) (err) attention right it just blows my mind [ah] ya and I really thought it's it's really nice [lah] and
not gonna lie [ah] it's very rare (um) for this kind of (err) shows or like this kind of anime to make me cry so got one time too I almost cried cause [ah] the part <malay>yang</malay>
(err) I think is the one <malay>yang</malay> the second episode <malay>yang dia pergi bunuh</malay> the very big demon then he touch the head
(uh) ya the the the one who killed the <malay>punya kawan</malay>
yes yes yes correct correct then the other one that affected me was (um) the <malay>apa</malay> moon that got strip of his (uh) power <malay>pasal dia tak</malay> (uh) eat enough humans the one who use the drums [ah]
ya (uh) I felt him cause when he was a human right he wanted to be a writer or something right then <malay>tak ada orang</malay> appreciate <malay>dia</malay> so like I can feel because I I also taking english myself so like I felt really
(uh) <malay>terkesan</malay> like I was like shocked [lah] when I cried a bit I was like [eh] <malay>tak pernah pernah macam gini</malay> the last time I cried was like (err) what endgame
[ah] (um) avengers endgame [ah]
very rare so I was blown away [ah]
[ah] no [lah] ya ya
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kompang</malay> <malay>kompang</malay> <malay>gitu</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi tapi</malay> stress [ah] <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> battle <malay>tu</malay> the other one that (err) was more stressful was the <malay>punya</malay> the he was using the spider web or something that was quite scary
ya lumen six ya but
ya he's so strong he got so pissed off when (uh) #nezuko# and #tanjiro# killed him but he attach his neck using the spider web but for me like what the heck seriously he just cut off [what] it's such a coward move but #gui# is just
<malay>sekali</malay> a one time slash then <malay>mati</malay>
that's why <malay>tak</malay> fair <malay>gila</malay> serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct
ya
(mm)
blow me away it's okay
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya even the intro <malay>dia punya</malay> what they call it opening I don't know opening [ah] the opening was also quite <malay>macam</malay> blood pumping [ah] for me personally but the one that hit me the most like for me personally [eh] for you is the music [kan] for me is the [ah] story line itself
ya and the part when he everytime when he kill the demon right he always like
(um) (uh) give them a proper farewell or like a form of respect <malay>macam dia tak</malay> just <malay>bunuh</malay> cause [oh] you're a demon cause (err) he take the time to like understand them look back [ah] look through their memories and then like say like [eh] you used to be human [lah] so it's not your fault you became a demon so that that part is I think the
(uh) I think that's the main [ah] unique point of [ah] demon slayer it's not just about killing demons it's about having a heart
(mm)
correct correct
(mm)
correct correct yes
ya ya ya
(mm)
correct
ya correct
ya that's why but the thing the thing that (uh) (um)
I I kind of (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> regret a bit right apart from (um) not catching up to demon slayer earlier on is that (err) to be honest but previously I was quite judgemental of anime [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> I look <malay>macam</malay> [ah] sometimes look at the art style <malay>macam</malay> very cutesy cutesy <malay>dia macam takda</malay> substance to it [ah] but then when I take the time to analyse right actually some #animes# are good it's not everytime <malay>macam</malay> those like (uh) act cute <malay>atau macam</malay> very cringe cosplay cause let's be honest there there are cringey cosplayers and all that but some of the #animes# are really damn good so <malay>aku macam</malay> semi regret so for me personally [ah] for demon slayer right I started on #naruto#
(um) [ah] I know it's one of the best #animes# but draggy <malay>gila</malay> it's too draggy for me but I'm just gonna take the time to like watch [ah] but waiting for season two demon slayer then like you said you recommend also [ah] the day before <malay>pasal</malay> one piece so that [one] will try so I start #naruto# first and then one piece but I don't know which one is longer #naruto# or one piece [ah] actually
one piece [eh] (uh) because (uh) #naruto# the one I saw on Netflix is like
nine season
and then ya then but the good thing about anime is like each episode it's twenty minutes [lah] so it's not too not too <malay>macam</malay> mundane I guess
ya especially like the those korean dramas ya <malay>tapi</malay> are these sorry is this the format for (err) anime like each episode got twenty minutes <malay>atau</malay>
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> movie is it
[orh] short film
(mm)
ya
[ah]
[pe]
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya the atmosphere won't be there the mood confirm <malay>hilang</malay> ya
(mm)
ya
ya
correct correct
standard ya
because speaking of this music and setting atmosphere right I think you also got do like music editing right for your game before ya ya in in school cause you're taking <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) I don't know if the name is still correct is correct me if I'm wrong
(uh) bachelor of arts
in game design not bachelor of science [one] science is programing [ah] ya
ya I see your math <malay>semalam</malay> [jer] <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> that's why I I don't take math
ya
(mm)
(mm)
that's why
correct correct <malay>yang semalam</malay> you show me the <malay>pasal apa tu</malay> row operation that [one] obviously I try [ah] but I really I really don't understand [lah] but the first few question I understand [lah] ya
ya [ah] the the velocity part I think
[ah] something like that ya ya but sorry my math <malay>tak bagus sangat</malay>
[ah]
correct
ya ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) famous [ah] ya ya ya
true like cannot generalise
(mm)
(mm)
correct
(mmhmm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya
because your friends always around you but I will say uni like really force you to be it is either you [ah] force you to be independent is one thing then like if you really try it yourself <malay>tak faham</malay> then you have to like (uh) you know push far and ask around cause if not right you are stuck ya that's what I felt <malay>juga</malay>
when I started
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
correct correct
ya ya
yeah I guess <malay>macam</malay> (uh) if like you if you like <malay>tanya</malay> then like you didn't try then think <malay>macam</malay> people think that you don't put in the effort that kind of thing then they will start to like have that kind of judgement so like that that that's the that's the dilemma I have also but most of the time I guess it it's our duty to try first and then like really <malay>kalau macam</malay> we are stuck there right then we just have to ask around if not really gone
ya but the the good thing about (uh) your course is that (uh) at least you know some of the people there already like some are before some are for me personally <malay>rabak gila</malay> [ah] [ah] I take english but then like (err) if even when I try my own right I really cannot do it so like most of the time I ask my lecturers a lot of question in fact I also got ask you some questions about my assignment <malay>juga</malay>
ya ya cause <malay>mak kau cikgu</malay> ya ya ya that's why it's it's true [ah] like I I always thought I had the mindset like <malay>boleh buat sendiri boleh buat sendiri</malay> just <malay>belajar</malay> [jer] just but then like eventually you're stuck then when you realise that you got different opinions right after you try right then at least you [ah] they call it (um) crystallisation of your thinking like make your (uh) [ah] word flow much more (uh) smoother [ah] in a way at least you can understand from different sides
ya [eh] <malay>tak tak</malay> I I saw in my study guide <malay>apa</malay> crystallise your thinking or something like it's not crystallisation (uh) like (um) basically they encourage <malay>macam</malay> (um) making study groups and all that cause for me like (uh) like you (err) yourself [ah] <malay>aku pun</malay> introvert that time (um) when I want to try ask <malay>macam malu-malu</malay> cause I feel #paiseh# [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
people think like you don't do your (err) revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is [ah] sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
(mm)
ya
[oh] this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] <malay>kira macam</malay> the vibe is it like you can feel the vibe [ah]
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
ya
(uh) ya ya ya ya ya
in a way [ah] in the same time at the same time from what you explain <malay>macam</malay> is to juggle the <malay>perasaan</malay> of the people right ya ya you like you have to be careful cause
(um) some (um) I think it's very rare [lah] that there are people who are very <malay>macam</malay> clear cut direct cause most of the time people try to <malay>jaga hati</malay> and try to be more mindful what they say
but it depends on the person itself [lah] but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice [ah] ya when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
as very (um) ruthless or very blunt [lah] <malay>macam</malay> later like even though the approach you have are valid I think the person will feel <malay>macam</malay> very (um)
[ah] that's why that's why <malay>rasa kecil hati kirakan</malay> ya
ya
ya
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] then when they continue doing that then they don't learn [kan] they don't go then like they keep having that mindset and attitude right then when they grow up right then will like realise <malay>asal semua orang</malay> keep attacking them ya that's the number one thing that's one thing I had to learn myself cause for me <malay>masa dulu</malay> I was very sensitive so now I try to <malay>macam</malay> balance out [lah]
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best [lah] cause over time like you have to
(um) adapt [ah] I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
(uh)
ya can I share one story ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> I'm guilty of this so (err) so (err) (err) (err) the the one thing that (err) you mentioned about time management there is it for me [kan] honestly speaking [ah]
(err) for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest [ah] this one I haven't share with you before (uh) so (um)
I kind of (err) didn't sit for my paper
ya so (err) this news right I'm just telling you this (um) okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that (um) if you don't sit for your paper
and then (uh) if you have (err) I think the requirement for the assignments is like (err) forty percent and above that means your over [ah] there are two components (uh) assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without (err) redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod [ah] so
for me
okay [lah] for me since I'm new to it [lah] like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
balance and all that so I admit [ah] sometimes I'm guilty of like not having that time management so I didn't have that much time to study so (um) before I made the decision to like sit out these two exams right like I (uh) consulted (err) my partner and my mother then they said that is fine [lah] then I think about it <malay>macam tak</malay> affect my grade cause there was a time before [what] I failed my exam then my (uh) drop <malay>rabak gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um)
I have to rebuild it slowly so I thought about it like (um) if I can just resit for exam might as well take next semester and just (err) restudy [lah] and the good thing [ah] about my school now is that since COVID right (uh) they allow us to aid they're going to waive off the resit fee cause by right (uh) you have to pay the fee [tau] it's not free resitting the paper I think it's hundred dollars for mine for mine that time but now it's free [lah] cause of COVID so like I'll just do it [lah] but even though with these factors in place and I still feel guilty <malay>macam</malay> I feel so bad <malay>macam kirakan</malay> I can clear the mod [one] then <malay>macam</malay> I'm just dragging but when I think about it I'd rather take this than risk my again (uh) cause (uh) the last time I checked if I fail again [kan]
<malay>aku boleh tendang sekolah</malay> [lah] like fully [ah] I (err) I think that's the requirement for my school first is academic warning letter then after that is (err) academic termination then you have to it's as if (err) after you <malay>kena</malay> terminated it's as if you have to (err) re-enrolled [lah] to the school so that's the downside [lah] so I'm like [ah] I don't wanna take the risk [ah] I don't mind dragging but my still maintain
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh]
like like
for one semester is like below two point eight straight away <malay>kena</malay> that kind of
[oh] range [oh] okay okay okay
[ah] [ah] that's what I <malay>kena</malay> ya that's why I'm like very scared now so like my now I'm slowly repairing so like it's in like in the mid twos [ah] if I'm being honest so like I think about it [ah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] just resit [ah]
I don't want to risk it ya <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] <malay>hati</malay> that time ya
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot entirely relate and I don't have the right to [lah] cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right [oh] for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different [ah] assignments and projects ya so because your school is (uh) assignment and project based my [one] is [ah] exam so that's the thing you all also have (err)
intermittent exams right
math [oh] my goodness
don't have (err)
(uh) not exactly math but I think (err) since your mum is a english teacher she should know also (err) there's this thing called (err) phonetics and (um) what is it under [ah] it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like (um) if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
(um) put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a (um) sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part [lah]
(uh)
there is one ya ya there is (uh) the (uh) what mod I took I think they taught us about (err) there are some similarities (uh) between (err) varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
(uh) are there but how there are different so that (um) when you speak a certain language right and someone is speaking a certain language they you don't understand each other then like how if you're speaking variety or dialect of it right you you understand so for example english your singapore english and malaysian english right you can understand but if I'm talking english [eh] I'm if I'm speaking english and <malay>kau cakap macam</malay> [ah] there are structures to it that make it different [ah] I think it's [ah] sorry if I pronounce wrongly mutual intelligibility or something like ya between languages [ah]
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya something like that [lah] like they have a (uh) a grammar structure specific for that language and a grammar structure specific for this language ya so we just study the differences [ah] ya so that's why they say we cannot understand different languages [ah] if like you use (uh) malay then I use english in like I really don't understand malay you don't understand english then like <malay>susah</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
(um) ya [lah] because essentially
it's a translation but then like (err) one word is before the other or one word is after the other so that's the that's the thing and it's very complicated to explain cause like for me when I see the like if you want to really analyse right like you there's a lot of different structures and then like (err) the placement of the words and all that so that's the difficult part [ah] ya I think there was once I I look (err) the one that my prof taught me was (err) <malay>apa ni</malay>
professor ya sorry (err) professor [ah] [eh] [ah] so casual <malay>panggil</malay> prof (uh) she talk about english in (uh) do I call it france or french french french sorry sorry sorry sorry france is the country ya <malay>allah</malay> [eh] sorry sorry (err) so basically (um)
(err) they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office [sia]
<malay>pejabat</malay> office right
[ah] <malay>pejabat pos</malay> so it's like it's reverse [ah] so that's the different thing
[oh] ya but okay [lah] (uh) that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about (err)
language and society like how people use language and all that that [one] is more to (um)
I would say (uh) you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how [ah] different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
[ah] dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's (uh) in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of (err) analytical type of a more research based type ya
these two is okay the one that really
headache now [eh] I wish I I don't have to take is (uh) literature
ya I don't know cause usually my course is english in psychology but then now they rebrand it [ah] so is english language and literature so like you have to take a minor in that so like if let's say you take minor english language and literature with communications for example so like so <malay>panjang</malay> right so like [ah] [tau] <malay>boleh takpe</malay> [lah] just let it go but I also don't understand why they suddenly (uh) change it like that like (um) they just make it english language and literature like (um) why they don't have the presets cause last time (uh) when I first enrolled it was english with psychology english sociology something like that ya then like when I saw that (um)
but they rebrand it so like no choice [ah] I just stayed [ah] cause I have to defer for (err) one semester

<malay>apa ni</malay> putting all your happiness right into this materialistic stuff then eventually it just wear on you

correct (uh) there's one prime example (uh) I think is everyone's favourite
unfortunately he died already [ah] it's iron man games of thrones <malay>tak</malay> game of thrones <malay>tak</malay> that (uh) one prime (uh) character in the Marvel (uh)
wait is he is not right [ah] Marvel cinematic universe [ah] iron man [ah] he don't have any powers but like he he's (uh) drive to make the world a better place and too (um) I think in age of ultron he said he want to like (uh) have a iron barrier around earth (uh) to like sort of protect [lah] but (um) even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like (uh) protect what's what matters to him the most [ah] so like (um)
(uh) adding to your part <malay>macam</malay> (uh) when you're someone normal and you don't have any powers you eventually (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
get the power from your own (uh)
belief and then like [ah] actually (um) it's not technically a superpower [lah] but it's more of like it's (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err)
his ability to (uh) be a genius
and like (uh) construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it [lah] like people always look at the (uh) powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
(uh) thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right [ah] and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes [ah] and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
keep up that that's the that's the ironic thing [eh] cause I just realised this now I'm having this (uh) [eh] epiphany <malay>macam</malay> if you notice [eh] in endgame
(uh) black widow and iron man <malay>tak ada</malay> power [tau] but because of them right they save the entire universe you think about it because black widow sacrifice herself for the soul stone then (uh) iron man <malay>dia</malay> (uh) take the <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) gauntlet from (err) thanos so like that part was already scaring me cause when he snapped right I thought it they really [ah] all the efforts for nothing but then like (err) he managed to get all the infinity stones on his (uh) hand then he just snap [ah] so it takes a lot of (um) courage to do that you know so like it was is is really (um) mind blowing to think that the two people who saved the universe didn't have that much powers they're just normal human beings with like one has a
I think she was like (err) (um)
(uh) assassin or some sort then she got (um) (err) close combat (err) training and iron man is just (err) a man with a suit [lah] but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite (err) touching [ah] if you think about it no power [tau]
(mm)
ya
correct
yes
(mm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> that day [jer] this is the type of body that you want on the beach [oh] my goodness
(mm)

it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people [ah]
(mm)
yes
<malay>dan</malay> cause also (um)
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice (um)
in the traineeship or the united jobs right cause like since I only part time now [ah] [eh] I'm working part time [lah] ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry [ah] but my job got suspended because of COVID so like (err) I cannot work for the meantime so (um) I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy [ah] but it's you're on the right track [ah] so it is relevant [lah] it's a good thing
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes
ya
ya
so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the (err) pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
like it's even more (um) [ah] amplified [lah] I guess <malay>lagi lagi malu</malay> [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
ya
ya
yes
ya
correct
ya
(mm)

[ah]
ya you need to (um) get the answer and then like you have to analyse it and then like tune it in a way that it suits your current situation

<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] some do play some do play not going to lie <malay>tapi</malay> (um)

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[eh] <malay>tak lari</malay> [eh] topic <malay>lari</malay> that's why

and in it's an ingredient for you to
(mm)
ya
it's very useful
ya
ya
ya
but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like (err) I I heard there's zero the zero gravity why am I stuttering (uh) the zero gravity there is quite (uh)
quite intense [ah] so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve (uh) being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something [ah]
ya cause if he want to be married [eh] buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)

that's why
ya
it's another planet

<malay>atau</malay> Grab express (uh) deliver parcel
ya but how many light years away is mars [ah]
I never thought about it [eh]
ya
[oh] it's not light years
years
[oh] but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough [eh]
I don't know how they do it [sia] seriously
ya ya ya correct
young [ah] !wah! that's a good thing [eh] like we can remain forever or like we can eliminate any <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya ya [orh] then (err) it'll be relatable to (uh) demon slayer when (uh) in the movie (uh) what's his name [eh] [ah] correct me if I'm wrong [ah] #asaka# <malay>ke</malay> #akaza# #akaza# he wanted to offer (uh) #rengoku# to be a a demon [what] ya so but he says the beauty of it is that humans die [ah] so
(um) if you remain at technically if you get to live forever <malay>atau</malay> you (um) remain here forever like you lose the beauty in it (uh) like if the circle of life doesn't go full circle
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive [ah] then you wouldn't die [ah]
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm) (mm)
that's right
ya ya ya
<malay>takyah mandi</malay>
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress [ah] then like you just stay stagnant [ah] like (uh) because it's not affecting you [what] and that's the thing about humans [lah] like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
but probably why [ah] sorry I keep relating to demon slayer cause it's quite relatable [ah] (err) probably why the <malay>apa</malay> six demon didn't (uh)
change [ah] the [ah] sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change [ah] but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the #manga# or the watch the (uh) talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of (um)
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph [ah]
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
(mm)
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to (err)
is #bangkok# the correct word like a way to (um) set the bar like I I (err) do as an inspiration [ah] in a way

so that's the good thing

I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb [eh] I guess [ah] when people pass on they look at the good things [ah] and they try to overlook the (uh) bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
(um) his negative aspects (um) (err)
even though they were quite drastic but (uh) the achievements overshadow that [ah] but in the end when everyone passes on right is (um)
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them [ah] recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper (um)
what's the word [eh] passing [eh] no (um) [ah] final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status (err) for awhile then like (um) at least you (um) go in peace [ah] like ya you don't feel like [oh] (um)
there's anything left
[ah] ya ya ya you you feel like (err) a burden off your shoulder [ah] in a way
what's why
(mm)
making one of the best anime
[oh] my goodness
ya
(mm)
that's why it's amazing how this (um) shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right

ya so after that we tried steelers and that was good what else did we try that day or did we call it a day afterwards
I think we also went to this (err) the cake malay restaurant right cause they they have the in in
south africa they have their own malay community
<malay>jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni</malay> plus <malay>kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada</malay> community <malay>melayu juga</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kita ingatkan</malay>
<malay>walaupun</malay> (err) the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
<malay>makanan mesti ada mesti ada</malay> [ah] <malay>sedikit</malay> [ah] <malay>yang sama</malay> [kan]

[ah]
[ah] <malay>ada tempat duduk</malay>

[ah] <malay>dah naik</malay> [a'ah]
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
<malay>dua jam mak</malay> [ah]
yes
yes
you know right
[oh] it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go #bukit timah# hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
[ah]
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot
yes

[ah] <malay>permandangan cantik lepas tu</malay>
<malay>pun</malay> it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
[a'ah] <malay>tu tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>angin dia kuat angin dia terlalu kuat sampai rasa macam</malay>
<malay>angin tu nak tolak kita orang</malay>
[ah] [a'ah]
[oh]
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just <malay>jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit</malay>
<malay>terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba</malay> [ah] <malay>angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari</malay> [eh]
[kan] that was an experience friend
(mm)
lion (uh huh)
[a'ah]
[a'ah] <malay>memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa</malay> mountain gear <malay>tu semua ada yang</malay> stick <malay>panjang tu</malay> [ah] hiking stick <malay>dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja</malay> [jer] <malay>jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu</malay>
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
[ah] I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
and we just rest and reflect <malay>apa kita orang buat tadi</malay>
!wah!
ya we went quite ya damn early
(mm) (mm)
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like [ah] <malay>tak puas</malay> cause like
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
[oh] we haven't went
cause I I like
cause I was really curious I actually <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] video signal hill <malay>macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas</malay> grass <malay>semua</malay> okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are

god damn it
!hais!
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip [lah] if I had to look back at the things that I've (uh) did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
<malay>makanan makan</malay>
I want to learn how to draw
<malay>macam mana nak lukis</malay> just <malay>bukan lukis saja-saja</malay> [tau] <malay>macam lukis macam macam</malay> artist <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>macam boleh dapat kerja</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> graphic design [ah]
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
okay <malay>pasal adik saya seorang</malay> artist <malay>jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang</malay>
it's a certain skill [lah] that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level [ah]
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
(err) art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my (uh) colouring skills
cause that's also (uh) colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
(mmhmm)
what about you
just one [ah]
can
[oh] !wow!
yes that's the way
okay
I [ah] I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
!wow!
[a'ah]
[oh] !wow!
kind of what
okay
(uh huh) [ah]
ya it will
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh) yes
did they die
[oh] gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so (uh) what else
two more skills
for me (um) other than drawing
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) swimming
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember [ah] my dear friend #wen xing# were walking at this
at this bridge bridge <malay>dia</malay> is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
[oh] shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak [eh] and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming [lah] ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point [ah]
the (um) <malay>tahun lalu</malay> I went to #krabi# <malay>dengan kawan</malay> #krabi# okay
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think !wah! it's like !wow! this girl really spend a lot of money to go #krabi# when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to #krabi#
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical (uh) suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her [eh] I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like [eh] shit she got kidnapped I die [sia]
like I will be responsible for that <malay>jadi jadi</malay> I remember after that I
like <malay>dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik</malay> to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
<malay>tak</malay> no it was it was it was already like
seven like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like (uh) if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping [lah] so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes <malay>pasal dia punya air air dia</malay> clear [kan]
<malay>jadi boleh nampak ada banyak ikan warna-warni</malay>
banana boat <malay>ada tu ada</malay> [lah] but
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have [lah] but ya I also like (uh) and then my friend was also (uh)
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is <malay>kita orang dua bukan orang</malay> kayak
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in #krabi# there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then (err) this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
#nadi# stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
and then I remember okay <malay>mula-mula</malay> there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care [lah] too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like [eh] shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is #vishu#
I'm like #vishu# we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with #vishu# is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over [oh] I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there [eh] no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
(uh) the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
there's certain places you can kayak right <malay>kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar</malay> [lah] but anyway <malay>gi</malay> kayak <malay>dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>tahu tapi kawan-kawan</malay> I <malay>semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat</malay> marina barrage <malay>ada kat</malay> lakeside <malay>pun padahal ada</malay>
[ah] cause (err)
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
(err) I a few people have #jio# me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya [lah]
ya ya ya
ya
ya I I actually (uh) <malay>baru belajar macam mana nak</malay> float <malay>masa kat</malay> #krabi# because (err)
I <malay>suruh</malay> ya I <malay>suruh kawan saya</malay> [ah] <malay>ajar macam untuk</malay> sorry [lah] [eh] #vishu# teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
good enough okay <malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
more you already say live one another alone
<malay>ye</malay>
ya ya !wah! I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain !wah! that [one] was another [one] cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me [ah] #nadirah# <malay>jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal</malay>
<malay>kalau tak nanti</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti penat pengsan kau dah</malay> [lah] <malay>selalu pengsan kau jangan</malay>
ya <malay>bawa gula bawa apa</malay> protein bar <malay>ke apa</malay>
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
I'm like !aww! <malay>tak aku tak bawa</malay>
<malay>aku terus lupa</malay> cause naturally
on the way up cause okay <malay>naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari</malay>
<malay>dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>kita orang ada bayar</malay> guide [lah] <malay>untuk bawa kita orang ke atas</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dorang ada</malay> [ah] <malay>ada tempat-tempat tidur</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
<malay>terus ada makanan dorang masakkan</malay>
<malay>jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga</malay> [kan] <malay>kita orang</malay> [lah] <malay>dua hari naik turun naik</malay> [eh] <malay>naik ada</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal</malay> time <malay>tu macam</malay> june june <malay>daerah kita orang daerah</malay> southeast asia [kan] monsoon season [kan] [ah] [ah] <malay>terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena</malay> stop <malay>apa semua</malay> and then I remember there were certain point where
(err) I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time [ah] my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear #vishu# looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry #nadi# I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay #vishu# is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
ya then she did that but then I remember <malay>macam</malay> the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
[ah] <malay>dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang</malay>
<malay>lima belas minit</malay>
(mmhmm)
but I remember that
like <malay>lima belas</malay> twenty
it wasn't that long [lah] it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe (err) buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it's like if you there you see the statue is like <malay>besar gila</malay> so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
<malay>entah tak tahu</malay>
but ya that was the only thing [lah] I was just like !whoa!
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
ya I don't know I just find it interesting [lah] but ya [lah] then I remember after the trip we basically we <malay>kita orang</malay> tour from the north
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next [eh] not not country
the city <malay>dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu</malay> and just get moving down down down all the way to #ho chi minh# kind of thing
and then I remember in the beginning it was [ah] there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause [ah] they
they had other plans [lah] okay
ya
no [lah] no me and #vishu# are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very <malay>kasar</malay> like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then [ah] after that (err)
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her [lah] ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them [lah] but <malay>agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi</malay>
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask [oh] <malay>kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa</malay> then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip <malay>bukan</malay> holiday holiday [tau] the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know [ah] like you cannot be too luxurious [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> too suspicious
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
that kind of thing <malay>terus aku ajar naik</malay> motor cause <malay>aku boleh naik</malay> motor [kan] <malay>terus dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau orang</malay> catch <malay>kita orang tak ada</malay> license <malay>macam mana terus aku macam</malay>
<malay>siapa nak</malay> catch <malay>kau</malay> [sia]
ya <malay>aku</malay> realised just okay <malay>siapa nak</malay> catch <malay>kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku</malay> [lah] <malay>apa-apa jadi aku ada</malay> license then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau takut banyak</malay>
<malay>sana punya orang punya</malay> license <malay>pun</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dorangnya</malay> license <malay>pun</malay> questionable [kan]
[a'ah]
<malay>lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam</malay> like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try [lah] like I don't know she will like says [ah]
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure [eh] maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like [eh] [ah] [oh] <malay>terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang</malay> vietnam <malay>jadi dia</malay> based her own experience <malay>dari situ dia kata kakak</malay> I <malay>kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia</malay> survey <malay>seratus orang boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia</malay> [kan] <malay>satu orang</malay>
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it [lah] cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
<malay>dia bukan cabut dia macam</malay> okay
[a'ah] plan <malay>dia memang</malay> until that time <malay>jadi</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu</malay> chill <malay>aku dengan dia kita orang jadi</malay> good friends <malay>terus habis tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> halfway through <malay>kena pergi</malay> laos
<malay>untuk</malay> internship
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember [ah] ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like !wah! their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay [oh] I remember
[ah] <malay>kita kena fikir</malay>
<malay>kita orang kena</malay> calculate you know <malay>kat depan tu</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi</malay> <malay>tapi dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>ikut</malay> [jer] ya
<malay>aku ikut asalkan duit aku tak tak tak buang lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi budak lelaki tu kena pergi</malay> laos <malay>untuk</malay> internship
and then <malay>lagi satu perempuan tu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang masalah sikit dia padahal</malay> free <malay>tapi pasal dia tahu dia tahu yang aku dengan kawan aku memang kawan mungkin dia tahu dia</malay> (err) visitor sorry <malay>dia pun sebelum kita orang pergi sana</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah</malay> decide <malay>yang</malay> okay
since <malay>budak lelaki ni akan pergi dulu aku pun akan pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi jadi macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>tak payah lama-lama</malay> [lah] okay [lah] that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya <malay>tak payah</malay> there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her [lah] ya
and then I ask #vishu# then why you #jio# and then #vishu# was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you [mah] then I'm like shut up [lah] don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to #vishu# the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where [ah] ya #krabi# and vietnam with her
it's [oh] ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause (uh) our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this (uh) basically the two of them they have a a very (uh) (err)
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far
so we were saying since you guys have limitations so might as well just go malaysia [lah]
ya
ya <malay>banyak tempat</malay>
[oh] ya
gosh [oh] ya and I was talking to my
other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
cause it's nearby but there's also a lot of places to visit there ya a lot of people don't know about what ya they just didn't do marketing very well like there's technically a lot of places to go to so ya
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>dalam masa depan</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>dah</malay>
okay
alright so how one two three one

!huh! serious
[oh] like that I play [eh]
I also just finish my exam like a week ago
so
I think I can start
<malay>main balik</malay> [ah]
but my rank is really low
like
I think I even hit the chicken
<malay>yang ayam punya</malay> rank
so I'm not sure but I can
log in later and see
I hoped they revamp a lot of the
better [eh] no their
hero <malay>lama</malay>
cause like they are so underused like
I'm pretty sure they still got value left
[oh] #layla# and #eudora#
but
<malay>aku main</malay> more to majors tho so
but I think I want to try playing fighter also [ah]
(hmm)
but I (hmm) but I used to play assassin also [ah] last time but I stop already cause like assassin is too squishy
then
[oh] and the toxic player back then is
<malay>melampau</malay>
so
I try not to play assassin anymore then my rank also went down like from eighty percent
and then it falls to like
I think it's lesser than fifty
so I'm still embarrass if people ask me for my rank and not to mention <malay>aku punya</malay>
skin is
one of those really premium skin that no one can get and truth to be told <malay>aku</malay> actually spend
diamonds
on that skin
I spent like
sixty dollars just for the skin on a a hero that I don't even play anymore
so
you know what
I will play mobile legend I will make that sixty dollars worth
okay so you're mythic but
like at least for me [kan] <malay>aku kena baca</malay> all the builds <malay>dulu</malay> [tau] <malay>dengan tengok</malay> video <malay>semua</malay> before <malay>aku main</malay>
so if you wanna if you want me to play [ah] I need to like
really do my research for my sixteen dollars game I'm bad seeing revamp heroes them I'm pretty sure they going at the buff heroes also
really
do my research for my sixty dollars game
(hmm)
but since they revamp hero
then I'm pretty sure they're gonna debuff heroes also
and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar #karina# anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow [ah] do you know that
<malay>kalau</malay> rank
rank <malay>siang</malay> my chicken rank
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
where people think like <malay>kita semua</malay>
player <malay>baru</malay> but
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay [lah] if you say the toxic is already lessen
<malay>aku</malay> join [lah]
(err)
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range [ah]
cause like if you fight from afar then <malay>siapa yang nak</malay> fight <malay>dekat depan tiada orang</malay>
[oh] ya wait I actually I can actually be a tank I remember I would do when <malay>kita</malay> lolita <malay>dengan apa</malay> [ah]
like lolita <malay>dengan siapa</malay>
(err)
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
(hmm) but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
(um) but <malay>aku nak</malay> try fighter <malay>juga</malay> [ah]
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work (uh huh)
(err)
I got the premium skin the what is it called [ah] the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
ya ya it's the #freya# it's the fighter and they did <malay>dia orang macam</malay> revamp #freya# right but because <malay>macam tiada orang</malay> like no one really hear nor really plays #freya# that much so
take #freya# for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play #freya# [eh] #freya# but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play #freya# at all I think that one time when you did show me play #freya# and like I got eighteen kills [kan]
actually <malay>itu aku</malay> smash buttons [jer] bro <malay>aku tak tahu apa aku buat kadang-kadang pun aku tak tahu aku tak baca</malay> skill <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just smash smash
<malay>tak tahu macam mana menang tapi menang</malay> [lah] then like
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
(hmm) so the skin pretty [lah] but the skill not there [ah] <malay>itu itu</malay> I think <malay>kau main dengan aku punya #freya# aku</malay> think <malay>kau pun boleh menang</malay> eighteen <malay>senang gila</malay>
the rank so I think <malay>aku</malay> just
go back to ranking up [lah] I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay [lah] I will rank I will rank
I also can like ideate do some research on #freya# <malay>sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>bukan macam</malay> full blast <malay>macam aku punya</malay> #vexana# <malay>semua</malay> yet if you hear my #vexana# right
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
<malay>aku dapat</malay>
<malay>menang menang menang</malay> all the way and zero deaths bro zero deaths
my is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie [eh] like shows your survival later but !wah! I tell you when you play [lor] ringing like
ya so the like shows your survival rate [lah]
like !wah! I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
(um) <malay>tak payah fikir tak payar fikir sangat</malay> [lah] some more #vexana# is like slow kind
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
so <malay>macam</malay> easy target <malay>gitu macam macam dia orang</malay> walking ducks then <malay>kau</malay> hunt <malay>dengan</malay> rifle then it's hunting season [lah] bro so like
shoot shoot [jer] <malay>tapi aku</malay> mage so ya <malay>aku</malay> shoot shoot <malay>gini lembat gila tapi</malay> target <malay>masih kena</malay>
<malay>alhamdulilah</malay>
okay I will I will stay stagnant I'm so long I'm having fun I'm flowing I'm good I'm gucci and I will I will rank I also want to challenge myself if it's I always play low rank then easy kill hunting season fun <malay>dia macam</malay>
it gets boring [kan] I need a challenge also
(mm) that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
<malay>merapek</malay> it's like one of those weak
majors but <malay>kalau kau tahu main</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi kalau kau tak tahu main</malay>
then <malay>ramai orang panggil kau</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] jessie is bad which is not good that's why I left the sixty dollars game
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay [lor] but so long okay [lah] so long you don't take aurora tho
aurora is <malay>lembab</malay>
<malay>dia tahu golek golek</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia belakang</malay>
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than #vexana# at least
#vexana# burns (um) <malay>dia punya</malay> target <malay>semua tapi</malay> like aurora
<malay>macam</malay> step <malay>lawa</malay> [jer] shiny shiny <malay>macam dia setakat</malay> over then I <malay>dengar</malay> [eh] <malay>tak nak nanyi</malay> let it go
to [jer] <malay>dia tahu</malay>
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at #freya# if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my #freya# I will give it a head [oh] but
besides #freya# what else because you cannot play
fighter what is this dragon <malay>apa ini</malay> dragon rider
[eh] <malay>dia jadi</malay> dragon <malay>ini bukan jadi</malay> dragon rider
<malay>ini apa</malay>
dragon tales [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak pernah nampak</malay> character <malay>itu ini</malay> [lah] what's in the league
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play #balmond# I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage [eh]
so like
I think <malay>kalau ada</malay> background music <malay>untuk aku punya</malay> #balmond# [kan] <malay>nanti bila dia buat yang</malay> ulti <malay>itu dengar</malay> quack
<malay>pasal tiada orang kena</malay>
but okay [lor] #balmond# <malay>aku</malay> think
no okay why <malay>aku</malay> choose #balmond# [kan] because when my sister (um) she just started playing so you have new characters to play
and like #balmond# is like one of those free [lah]
so <malay>aku</malay>
choose #balmond# [lah] cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play #balmond# and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing [kan]
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a #balmond#
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a #balmond#
okay at least <malay>kau sedar diri</malay> then <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>kau jangan</malay> step <malay>jadi</malay> tank #yu zhong# <malay>ke apa</malay> dragon <malay>orang semua ingat kau nak</malay> dragon up <malay>ke</malay> dragon tales
okay [lah] [eh] the eye
(uh huh) ya I did my research on #hilda#
do you know they revamp #hilda# that's why it's actually
(uh)
<malay>dia macam</malay> hype <malay>sekarang</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> revamp #hilda# and like really give her
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration
regeneration when she's in the bush
so <malay>korang semua</malay> recall [kan] this #hilda# sneaky <malay>dia dekat dalam</malay> bush and she's just recovering health consistently
so like recall button #hilda# they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
[eh] but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy #hilda# but I scared like !wah! I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
<malay>kau tahu kau dalam</malay> bush [kan] then you press this one skill later your speed <malay>laju</malay>
<malay>nanti kau</malay> zoom <malay>dengan</malay> #hilda# <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> muscle muscle <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>itu yang aku suka macam kau dah terperanjat</malay> like <malay>kalau ada</malay> music background [ah] <malay>nanti dengar</malay>
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her [lah] if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first [lor] cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
<malay>apa itu dia orang nak</malay>
you save one million coin then you get bonus is it <malay>mana ada</malay> spend [ah]
<malay>simpan pun buat apa ini apa</malay> saving account
okay [lah] ya I think if we
were to put a real term on #hilda# it's like all of a sudden [kan] <malay>kau tengah buat kerja</malay>
then all of a sudden <malay>ada</malay> one train railway rail suddenly all of a sudden right a railway underneath appear under your feet then suddenly one train coming towards you then obviously you at the railway how to run right [ah] <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dah ada tempat</malay> protector <malay>semua</malay>
so <malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
well but I don't know [lah] I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
#hylos# I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like #hylos# cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
a working furnace where he just burn like he's burning himself to furnace constant consistently then <malay>bila</malay> mana <malay>dia habis</malay> [kan] then
you burn your health then <malay>macam</malay> like you the tank so like people already burning down your health then <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau dah tiada</malay> mana then <malay>kau pun</malay> burn down
<malay>itu dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> double edged sword [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>kena macam</malay>
lost world <malay>itu</malay>
that's why I don't like #hylos# I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
where as #hilda# is like okay retreat then you go to the bush then you work out work out and exercise <malay>minum</malay> protein <malay>semua</malay>
then you go into the field full health
<malay>itu lagi macam</malay>
but I need to practise #hilda# I so so scared <malay>dia orang pun</malay> debuff #hilda# [eh] cause it's like legit a lot of players are playing #hilda#
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
he's such an undervalued hero being played in low rank then when you go meet ranks suddenly <malay>dia orang</malay> ban <malay>macam tak</malay> make sense [lah]
unless
no [lah] [ah] ya it doesn't make sense but besides uranus <malay>dia orang</malay> ban <malay>siapa</malay> like basic gusion
worse [eh]
(um)
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
[oh] [ah] [lah] actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
[oh] no wonder then
(mm) then I guess #hilda# is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you [oh] ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
[oh] cause did not admit cause <malay>dia orang tak baca dia orang tak tahu baca dia orang suka</malay> smash smash button <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>entah masuk</malay> meeting <malay>macam mana itu</malay> kidding [lah]
or am I
(mm) but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
<malay>nak buat apa dengan kita punya</malay> container tank <malay>itu</malay> [eh]
I mean staycation is in january tho
we haven't even plan anything
(uh) and everytime I ask #haizat#

[kan]
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
why why why would you spend on that care bear <malay>baju</malay> and then wear outside
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point [kan]
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
#haizat# agrees
with the care bear <malay>baju</malay> and <malay>seluar</malay>
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
weird on him I don't know I imagine spongebob <malay>kaki pakai</malay> care bear shorts

!wah! look at the sofa !wah! look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
(mm) I'm quite concerned because #haizat# haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
I think we can save to say <malay>kita</malay> rest
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
dinner <malay>kita makan luar</malay> like around the area just get the feel of
the feel of where we are
then <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> (um)
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
no I think okay since before that right like on the first day <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>dah lepas makan</malay>
then <malay>kita</malay> rest <malay>balik dekat</malay> container then the gym is not that far then I'd rather we just gym at night
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning [lah] I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
[oh] wait <malay>tapi kau takut kau takut kau takut</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak pergi</malay> okay okay <malay>pagi</malay> let's go <malay>pagi</malay> gym <malay>pagi</malay> gym <malay>aku lupa</malay> sorry

I think it's town area
okay but if we're
okay [lah] I mean I don't mind grabbing there first cause like if we're about to I think I'd rather we just like wake up early then start our day early [lah] then <malay>macam</malay>
just
instead of grabbing there just take public transport [lah] I mean like not that one hour journey and (uh) and (uh) how how much is that twenty six dollars I I I think one hour journey I I mean it's it's okay
(um) okay [lah] I get okay you know [what] how about
I am so #ons# if we're just going to stay in the container all the way so I mean this going out thing is actually #haizat# plan [eh]
wait wait do you want to go out of the container I already ask you that but I feel like I already know the answer because I know you
okay wait but we can we can go outside if we
how do I say if the places are nearby [lah] but if the place not nearby then I can we have a second suggestion cause I'd rather the place nearby
and
(um) <malay>tak payah</malay> grab cause grab spend extra money I mean like this #haizat# he do you know that his grab account is platinum
I haven't I've never went past gold like I know like I know my limits
(mm) but
I think we can one one place I know is cow play cow moo which is quite near one of I mean [eh] no no that's promenade right
I take it back I don't know where is one-north is what is my workplace all we have is laboratories
I don't know I don't know
if you go by circle line then far [lah] cause like one-north promenade is like other end to other end [leh]
I but I think the journey is like forty five minutes max
we talking about food are we going to cook all the way I would rather cook all the way I mean I don't mind eating maggi
I mean come on #samyang# man I mean (uh)
no brainer answer #samyang# all the way to cook #samyang#
that's like
if aliens were to find me or catch me they open up my stomach they're just going to find #samyang# no those are not my intestine those are my #samyangs#
wait where am I going with this so besides #samyang# what else to eat are we going to eat all the way inside or are we just going to cook
once in a while some more maggi is like
#haizat# don't even eat spicy so
even maggi is quite limited for him
[oh] ya Mcdonald that's like the only cheapest food that I know and it's really nearby
one-north
yup okay

no all of your guys have no taste <malay>takde</malay> trust just kidding my taste is just
weak [lah]
you all don't watch cartoon I watch cartoon [oh] wait you watch winx club
I'm so glad I'm not the lowest at the bottom of the food chain
tasteless
[oh] wait I just exposed to other people that you are watching winx club that's right #siti farhanah#
watches winx club and she's twenty four years old guys
[eh] since when I say I watch spongebob I don't watch spongebob I only watch their memes
they are meme materials
and that it's acceptable
no no no I swear <malay>aku tak tengok</malay> spongebob it's really by memory based
(err) but to argue that I did watch but <malay>itu bila itu macam</malay> like
like <malay>lima tahun kau punya</malay> winx club <malay>satu tahun pun tak boleh</malay> I'm pretty sure you watch winx club recently I don't even know why you watch winx club okay [lah] I won't judge you then at least you don't watch my little pony if you do I will judge
I will roast you from hell to back
I can go all the way it's okay no it's it's it's for it's fine if you want to watch my little pony by these people who watches my little pony they are there's a certain
there's a how do I say there's a this weird weird
(um) group there were just (uh) my little pony and (err) I don't think ponies are supposed to doodle stuff so ya I'm judging the that specific group that those they do note that that's not horseback riding right there that no no no no there is something else
no no no it's not the cartoon it's the people watching the cartoon they changed the cartoon and made it inappropriate that's what I was talking about
okay so I guess that's the end
(uh)
[oh] ya we haven't do our staycay
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] time to rank up [lah] bro

!wah! so #shiok# to wake up on a monday to <malay>atas</malay> view of orchard and eat breakfast in bed in
but it's not really budget [what] it's okay [lah]
it's it's in the middle of town but it's like the entrance is <malay>ulu</malay> but in town like like you cannot find the entrance like if you didn't tell me I wouldn't know where is it
ya
it's
in singapore
no [lah] but at the rate like we are walking like <malay>ulu</malay> hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot <malay>tahan</malay> is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
nobody is going to stare at your body [lah]
well to be fair since you so #paiseh# I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like (err) chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot #chope# seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty (err)
no the
are you sure he's the same age as us [what]
but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that #dulan# face
annoying [sia] he's going to give you even more #dulan# face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the (err) I don't know he's but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know [ah] the person is like the the nephew or [eh] no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue [lah]
ya ya
ya ya
their customer their customer base quite like a lot [what] people go there and <malay>makan</malay> like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya
ya the grandparents are both super cute but I think the grandma like (err) sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like #lim# <malay>kopi</malay> like lunch hour people take their own time
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you from behind you
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay [lah]
ya ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the <malay>macam</malay> the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like [oh] ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot
we
was it we #dabao#
no before we came before we [ah] (err)
I
ya ya
ya so is like
(err) what's that called it's nice [oh] but the indo food there is not bad also after
no not <malay>ayam merah</malay> the there there is this <malay>minang</malay> store in lucky
[ah] indoor and I like because they have this <malay>sapi goreng</malay> or <malay>empal</malay> ya ya that [one] is nice it's not bad I brought #risa# there she ate like she order all the vegetables I'm like what the hell
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten (err) ten every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years [lah] so she she scared already (err) ya
so had try [lor] try and walk (err) ten ten ten everyday if not like ya
because the husband <malay>kena</malay> heart attack [what] but that [one] heart attack in sleep so like she don't want like confirm plus chop she also <malay>kena</malay> [lah]
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age [ah] then you look back at your at your food intake
<malay>macam</malay> over the past twenty years
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food [leh] she
no she has (um) (err) high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now [what] right like
last time he got juggle his intake [meh]
exercise [ah]
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty [mah] like the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
(uh) really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that [one] cannot I I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
diabetic <malay>sana</malay>
(mm)
[oh] he cannot take because of this but he's fit [what]
[ah] okay okay
ya
!wow! okay that is quite #sian# cause like I see him exercise so much and (err) workout so much and then
ya sugar sugar level quite easy to maintain [one] as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff [lah] because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar [what] so ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know [ah] don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically lose the
ya
[oh] shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first (uh) like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why !wow! there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but [oh] ya [oh] wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was (err) what's that called [ah]
she was eating a whole plate of <malay>tauge</malay>
with like I think is a vegetarian meal [lah] so like
no like (err) there's (err) you know like those kind that looks like #mala# but I don't think it's #mala# it looks like (err) it's soya sauce so it has like
<malay>tahu</malay> and all but but the bulk of it is <malay>tauge</malay> and I'm like she is eating one big plate of <malay>tauge</malay> I'm like okay healthy people
ya everybody now want to be in (err) healthy lifestyle (err) why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one (err) ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya they're forced [lah] like die die die die must do [what] because like [oh] shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin> like quite embarrassing [lah] or like <malay>macam</malay> you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said (ugh) she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember
ya and I and then we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like [eh] #bo# #jio#
no when people when people #jio# you you not like you will reply [what]
ya
not you [lah] I mean like other people people !alamak!
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online [lah] it's like everybody
but then some people will your life like
crazy it's scary [lah] if you [ah] used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
wait so after we eat we're going to go to the Rolex centre cause we <malay>atas</malay>
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we (err)
at where [oh] so much for like not <malay>atas</malay> and then want to shop some more
(err)
I am eyeing that item online if I buy outside some more right <malay>habis</malay>
no the dress that I show you the the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot (err)
!aiya!
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very #sian# because I miss it (ugh)
it is it's available but it's like (ugh)
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like !aiya!
no if it's white I think I'll wear it only for really like <malay>macam</malay> events like like events [ah]
[ah] yes it must not be cause otherwise
(err) so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like for the black [one] can wear when we go out but then for the white [one] maybe wear to like wedding
(err) thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the white and black dress but it's like a lot (ugh)
(err) in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep [mah]
same
not not about options or design [eh] like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb [ah]
ya just
no [lah] it's not that it's not that #jialat# [what]
you should wear plain clothes then just wear bright coloured like (err) <malay>hijab</malay> so it's not so #jialat# it's like
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years (err) if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one [ah]
for me
I think
<malay>jangan berangan</malay> [lah] please
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel [lah] if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
[ha] not so #jialat# like expand too much right (err) then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive [one] is like [oh] my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
[oh] let's go see (err) universal traveller the winter shop

is like
ya it's nice [leh] but like !aiya! I'm not gonna spend that much that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong [one] they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia [one] and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in and obviously thailand is a standard [one] [lah] a
what we opening office in but they're gonna use (err) they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like cordon off and use it [lah]
but is
no it's gonna be operational in jan but <malay>leceh</malay> because it's malaysia so they're (err) authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not [lah]
[eh] I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open (err) an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
like I think you really I don't know [lah] whether you need to like but then malaysia <malay>boleh</malay> so everything <malay>boleh</malay> you just need to have money
above table under table whatever [lah] wherever
ya but once we once okay [lah] not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
[ah] okay [lah] not immediately maybe you have to wait until like (err) I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so [leh] they say leisure
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't (um) like if you don't get tested then okay [lah] basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I [ah] you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in [lah] like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also has about what five hundred and twenty million people
that that day #pedi# said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free [what] to watch so like they (um) what's that called they were saying like (err) please do not travel and to minimise the spread [ah] the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at (err) it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are #kiasu# usually (err) #kiasu# #kiasi# don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
the younger ones [ah] <malay>macam</malay> the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still <malay>lepak lepak</malay> and like
but you will immediately be fined [what] not [meh]
no <malay>ada</malay> [what] remember during the circuit breaker the the the
the expat <malay>yang</malay> is it the group of expat <malay>pergi</malay> robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching [what] like <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kalau dorang</malay> didn't get send back home [eh] actually <malay>dorang tak kena hantar balik</malay> [kan]
!chey! they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail [meh] like no no jail like
!aiya! whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a more serious
it's like how
the india [one] [ah]
no but look at
isn't it like (err) what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
exactly that's why this people expats all rich [what] <malay>boleh bayar</malay>
ya
but then again right it's quite <malay>bodoh</malay> because you think about it [ah] <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small [what] even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five [what]
so you wear mask at all times at your table
[ah] that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like !huh! but we one person [what] what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone [lah] I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody <malay>boleh nampak</malay>
that's true have you seen
yup my cheeks are like [oh] my god it's like <malay>rabak</malay>
but then cannot do anything but it's okay [lah] the mask will cover so (uh) <malay>tutup</malay> [jer] <malay>muka</malay> and the trick is <malay>pakai</malay> nice eye makeup so the <malay>mata</malay> nice like <malay>lawa</malay> the
the rest never mind [lah]
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that [one]
[eh] the the the #khatib# new (err) playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
#khatib# SAFRA [ah] ya the one (uh) jason went the the
HomeTeam #khatib# HomeTeam at #khatib# I told you before
(uh) ya but (uh) maybe not not when (uh) got menses
okay that [one] ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more
nope once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
(err) okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different [lah] I think you next time shouldn't
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because (um) <malay>nanti orang perasan</malay>
no <malay>orang akan perasan</malay> and <malay>orang akan rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> caring [eh] this person <malay>boleh dengar aku</malay>
no
no you cannot do this because all these <malay>mamat belok ni semua macam</malay> (um)
<malay>dorang</malay> is it <malay>bebal dorang bebal</malay> so
and also <malay>kalau</malay> even <malay>kalau macam</malay> (um) [oh] is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this <malay>mamat-mamat</malay> especially malaysia you must think like the typical <malay>melayu</malay>
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like [oh] you're so caring I'm like what the hell
(err)
actually I don't get it <malay>macam</malay> it's only in games [mah] like you can talk [ah] but <malay>macam</malay> why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite #kaypoh# [what] no [meh]
seriously
okay cause like if if
what is favourite <malay>buaya</malay>

there's <malay>bodoh</malay> it's just like
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>dekat kita punya</malay> void deck <malay>bawah</malay> block like the the kind that government makes
<malay>dia duduk tepi</malay> road <malay>untuk main</malay> game

just to <malay>main</malay> game until really late

exactly so why would you bleed if it's only <malay>tangan</malay>

#siao# [lah]
at least the mum <malay>ikut</malay> I think it like <malay>kalau kena</malay>
a spotify or
[ah]
you eavesdrop <malay>dengar apa</malay> [jer]
as in <malay>budak tu nampak dah</malay> pregnant <malay>tu tengah</malay> [oh]
ya
[eh] I talking about this (um)
I don't know whether I told you but (err) so like (uh) I watched Tiktok videos right so in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
<malay>tapi</malay> the youngest <malay>yang aku nampak</malay>
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
she's turning twenty one next year <malay>habis anak dia</malay> turn seven and I'm guessing <malay>tak habis</malay> school [lah] right
unless (err) defer <malay>sekolah atau pergi sekolah</malay> until like you're thirty eight thirty
no you can differ [what] <malay>macam</malay> skip school for ya [lah] <malay>macam lepas beranak</malay> she can <malay>pergi sekolah</malay> then <malay>mak dia jaga</malay> [lah]
but the thing is
fourteen what the hell <malay>kau beranak</malay> fourteen <malay>empat belas tahun empat belas tahun</malay> you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right <malay>kau beranak</malay> like [oh] my god <malay>kau beranak</malay> at like <malay>enam belas tahun</malay> or like maybe (uh) <malay>enam belas tahun</malay> onwards <malay>kau beranak</malay> is still considered teenage mum
<malay>kau beranak</malay> at <malay>empat belas</malay> it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was I was waiting for my menses
ya I like why would you why would you be why would you give birth at fourteen okay [lah] but I think the is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
(err) maybe their pull out game <malay>rabak lembap atau</malay> (uh) <malay>atau</malay> (err) because oral contraceptive <malay>kena bayar</malay> condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
!huh!
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
!ee! but then it has no rubber at the side
you <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] just <malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] but then again there are people on or like even the tubal ligation then <malay>tiba-tiba mengandung</malay>
ya
so it's like
[oh] no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
no sometimes it's quite (uh) quite (err) [oh] ya after the menstrual cycle <malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay>
but it's just like I don't know it
and then ya is people all this whatever [lah] I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like <malay>tak gagak</malay> [sia]
why would you why would you do that <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] she signed on to army so is like
(err) ya is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything
what had he gain
<malay>empat belas tahun</malay> catch no ball with a son to look after
catch ball
<malay>bodoh</malay>
next time just catch the ball don't catch the sperm
the sperm stay inside <malay>bodoh</malay> it's like
because when they do sex education we are asian <malay>dorang tak nak cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>korang tak boleh ada</malay> sex with like condom but kids are not stupid they're watching porn [eh] eight or nine years old
!huh! but all kids have phone now [what] you know even if they don't know how to search right you know sometimes like let's say you know like you watch show <malay>habis ada</malay> pop up

okay so after that the third year <malay>engkau</malay> move out because with your aunty and then
(uh huh)
[ah]
then what you mean by overs over overstayed your welcome or something like that
ya but is it your own your own <malay>punya</malay> feeling or <malay>memang</malay> they are the one who gave you hints
okay
okay
so only after that you move back to your parents [ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> when you go back that time (uh) like it within that three years you and your mum you guys on okay terms or you guys don't talk at all or what
(mm)
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
ya ya but you and her now <malay>dah</malay> okay [lah]
like become such a cool mum [ah]
having disputes [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
I think she has learnt to accept and agree to disagree [lah] you know why bro I I whatever you told me here right I can actually relate but mine didn't happen at a late stage in my life [lah] mine happened earlier ya like for example okay I was such a nerdy boy [lah] you know my two elder brothers were the naughty ones you know drop out before they completed secondary school kind ya but I was the one who was always the studious one so but okay my my my <malay>nakal</malay> my naughtiness is not like my brothers they are very active in terms of you know they they they skip school [lah] they get into they they start to steal from shop [lah] that kind of things my naughty was my mouth I like to I don't like to lose an argument [ah] so <malay>aku suka jawab</malay> [jer] you know so you know so my you know so as I grow older you know teenage teenage years is when you feel like you're already an adult you feel like you know what you doing so my ego kind of got in the way with my mum [lah] you know so there was a time that I even ran away for two weeks you know but that was my teenage days and then of course [lah] you know teenage and it became a pattern it became a habit like you [lah] you know you ended up becoming a fight often [ah] but for our case is not religious matters [lah] for me I think it's just I think it's just my mum's it's stuck in a is stuck in a psyche [lah] because she was a single mother for awhile
[ah] so she had to support three kids and two of them was extremely naughty she always have to and you know she's she has to play the father role ya so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] ya ya so I can understand her stress [ah] she was the old school hard knocks kind [lah] you know tunes you whack you left right centre you know like the kind [lah] if you go at your cousin's house right she just give you a stare you know you go back you die already you know that kind of fierceness [lah] so for me as I grow older I guess she also aged you know and (um) I think she kind of toned down a bit but she completely tone down only after I started to live alone
[ah] when I was like twenty one twenty one twenty two (err) I stayed at (uh) you know those government rental house ya I I stayed (uh) using (uh) someone's name [lah] ya because that person had was sick so she (uh) the <malay>nenek</malay> like vacated the house and I thought there was nobody so I stayed there for good one year plus [lah] ya but they wanted to hold the house because she still wants to go back after she recovers ya so for about one year plus I live separately but I mean I told my mum nicely [lah] I say I think I want my own space and it's it's closer for me to go to work cause that time I was part time bouncer and like my work is around the central area (uh) my my house was at outram there the old school #jalan kukoh# [lah] you know ya ya so when I stayed apart everytime I come back things got better [ah]
I think this is what they mean by distance makes the heart grow fonder right you know when you was you start to appreciate each other more of course she was unhappy you know because we were fighting a lot [lah] and then after that okay and then regarding the house I know what you mean by overstayed your welcome because okay (uh) when when I was in my early twenties <malay>kita</malay> actually <malay>nak pindah kita nak pindah rumah</malay> so by right we already moved to #yishun# way back already [tau] but then (err) this (err) it's a it's a chinese family [lah] so initially they're supposed to move out of their house while we move it so it's the fault of our agent because why did she go and confirm sell our house before we confirm get that house so what happen between that family was the mother got a dispute with the son so when the son move out the mother doesn't want to move out anymore
so we are stuck with no house [ah] so I had to stay for almost two years and my uncle's house like my whole family about like six seven of us we stay in one room [lah] my my uncle that my cousin give out his room for us [lah] but you can feel [lah] after awhile that they I mean they never fight they are very nice to us but you can feel like the energy is no longer like they can if some form of like <malay>rimas</malay> if I don't know if that's the right word ya so ya but they are nice about it ya so I totally can relate [lah] then after that I move to for five years so I realise that the same like you [lah] the over the overcome I mean the overstay welcome thing and the second thing also the fact that the more I'm distant with my mum the more we get along when I whenever I come back to see her
ya so like now when I come back due to COVID for the past six months right we never fight [lah] like we we we very cordial very civil ya ya ya like we really accepted and sometimes in fact last time wherever she met it will trigger a nerve [tau] but now no you know whenever she nag I'll just look at her !alah! she's aging already and then I will just tease her I'm like <malay>kenapa ni marah-marah tak penat ke</malay> you know
yes
passionate [ah] <malay>kira</malay> defensive [ah]
grow up
ya
tense up [ah] [ah]
ya ya
fight [ah] ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing [ah] ya
ya ya
ya
[a'ah]
[ah]
probably probably ya
(mm)
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear [lah] [ah] if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why [ah] what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside [leh] you look soft outside and inside you are [eh] fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it [ah]
adamant [ah]
[oh] okay okay okay
ya
(mm)
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] you know what dude actually what right (uh) one thing you should actually I recommend [lah] you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book [ah] dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that [eh] no no some people actually (uh) you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply apply different technique [lah] then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a !wah! dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what [lah] but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good [lah]
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook [ah] and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F [ah]
the the title might be crude but the content is very good bro ya it teaches you about okay like for example right in in in like one day you only have so much F's to give you know there's only so much energy you can impose on so it's about what do you channel you your energy like which one which one which one you should matter more like for example they give an example [lah] (uh) you know like how sometimes people (um) okay like let's say you you you go inside a building there's a security guard sometimes you know some security guard can be very relax some very #nya# one the #nya# one [ah] actually they have a you should empathise with them you know they might look like as if their petty or whatever but it's because they they feel like that's the only time they can feel important they can feel like they have authority because throughout their life probably they never get that so they tend to super imposed on it that's why some people I don't know like for me I work in hotel line before [ah] !wah! sometimes when people in the level of managerial position [ah] are sometimes very #guai lan# you know bro <malay>dia orang</malay>
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel (um) wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the #mats# can walk like that or the #bengs# they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
ya [lah] but no [lah] I truly mean it empathise [lah] <malay>kau jangan ketawa</malay> now you make me feel bad for laughing
like !whoa! so big like they as if they got like big triceps [ah] that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also [lah] ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
[oh] really [ah]
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time [lah] [ah]
opening [ah] ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
[a'ah] then then then
I I think so [ah] why [ah] recall recall recall help me recall
[oh] ya okay okay then then then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
!oi! my memory very bad [lah] bro very bad bro (mm)
(mm)
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
[ah]
ya
ya
okay
something new [ah]
(oo)
[eh] but dude I thought all this while <malay>memang</malay> you were actually very motivated to be a pilot [what] no I mean like I I didn't know that I actually helped to contribute even a bit I didn't know I thought you were always like constantly motivated like you know this is the only thing that you want
okay [ah]
ya ya you can like transfer [ah] ya
okay
[ha]
flying [ah] (mm)
[ah]
so okay so what what how's your journey okay can you share your journey about <malay>macam mana kau jadi</malay> pilot or how you you let what from the beginning how did it all begin like not not when you were a kid [tau] not the interest [tau] the part where you start to casually start to enter become a pilot
okay
okay
okay
ya
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky [ah] that person should never have been a pilot [sia] but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
[oh] eventually they change [lah] when did they change
okay okay
(mm)
(mm) ya ya ya
okay
!wah! motivated like crazy [sia]
[oh] very young [ah]
[ah]
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
(uh huh)
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
okay
okay
let go [ah]
so so okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying [ah] you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly [what] okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay [ah]
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength [ah] ya ya ya
[oh] but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career [lah] it's more of like (uh) okay okay not not so much of a mistake [lah] not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
[ah]

holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
[ah]
okay
[ah]
(mm)

(oo) <malay>sayangnya</malay>
[oh]
[a'ah]
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
(mm)
okay
this was when [ah]
how you afford all these things man operation [lah] go [lah]
you loan [ah]
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
[eh] no [lah] because new house you say you use [mah] you don't have to cash contribute [what] <malay>ada</malay> how much
!oi! okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room [ah]
but you're
ya
[ah] who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
[eh] that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know [ah] it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no [ah]
just a cross [ah] [oh] okay
no you know why because I don't know [lah] it depends on my future [lah] because for now there's a lot of changes [ah] okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the so did you manage to fly yes right
#dubai# right #dubai# airline is it
[oh]
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience [ah]
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that [lah]
[ah]
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit [lah] ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry [lah] the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts [ah]
(mm)
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal [ah]
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
(mm)
!wah! how many airplanes [sia] bro like that
!wah! I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue [lah] like from steward to be flying [lah] okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is (uh) my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
[oh] you went through the three months [ah] [oh] it was supposed to be that stage already [lah] [oh]
!wah! dude that time if you fly [ah] your inter pretty stable and nice [ah] bro four to six K easily [sia]
[eh] but your setback like really like what I what what I like to say you know <malay>nasib kentang</malay> [eh] like like first okay [lah] the eyesight is a challenge okay never mind overcome already hernia is a challenge twice and then that hernia affected your flying and then after that when you were to fly the COVID <malay>pula</malay> happen like !wow!
your <malay>nasib</malay> is so <malay>kentang</malay> [lah] dude
<malay>nasib kau sangat kentang</malay> bro I don't know why I say <malay>kentang</malay> [ah] but I feel like it sounds right <malay>nasib kau kentang</malay>
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike [ah]
ya ya
!walao! I don't think that's anywhere close [sia]
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there [sia] on the drone
okay
that's relatable [lah]
[ah] okay okay so it's just a matter of time [lah]
another <malay>ujian</malay>
by then if if still got another factor by then I think I visit you at asylum already your always pretending to fly and then I'll go to #salihin# <malay>ni</malay> edwin <malay>jadi nyanyuk</malay> ready for take off and then the nurse come stewardess are you ready to fly
and then you have friends over there <malay>orang yang dalam</malay> asylum they will actually entertain you they will sit behind you [siol] [lah] funny [sia]
[siol] [ah] <malay>kau</malay>
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of #mumammad salihin#
ya then eventually when people see the peak [ah] [lah] it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession [eh] but okay [lah] but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
it's the attitude of the top ten per cent people you know or not like they they never say die attitude you know I I realise like most of us okay I remember one story [lah] I don't know if I've ever told you this before there was a legendary pianist [ah] so she's like a old lady [lah] you know so she was having a final performance and then this young teenage girl like very early teenage [lah] like went to her got the backstage pass and said like you know one day I want to grow up and be just like you and then she literally just this old lady like she literally just <malay>macam</malay> smile casually and just said you know you're not the first person to have said that everybody say they wanna be like me but when it comes to putting in the hours that I put it nobody is willing to do as much you know which is true you know everyone wants to be reached but nobody is willing to fail you know
ya like for you you are like [oh] crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum [lah] so ya but but but no [lah] I I wish you all the best [ah] brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it [lah] it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field [oh]
(mm)
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him [ah] ya like before him right you see bush !wah! everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him [ah] the like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman [lah]
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics [ah] in the ya in the
he's he says without filter
unwise
no [lah] bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back [eh] okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that [lah] but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead [mah] like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks [what] the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people [lah] the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have #genghis khan# you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them [lah] you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that (um) people just have space to voice out things
ya but that's about it bro eventually the one making the decision you can voice out ten thousand and one things like for example look at the the black lives issued right how many people get shot dead but what what actions have been taken nothing [what] you know so eventually it doesn't matter the only difference is you got more room to voice out that's it because if you go to like china you will say something wrong you <malay>kena</malay> arrest you go to saudi arabia you insult the king you <malay>kena</malay> arrest then tortured that kind of thing you know but democracy they just don't have that but ultimately the system underlying thing it's the same thing [lah] as you if your leader is shitty as a nation you gonna be shitty which is why I I respect the new zealand parliament right now even canada is also not too bad as as as on the surface as what I see [lah]
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person [lah] how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now [lah] because if I go there I will die of boredom [sia]
if you want to die if you wanna retire old can you know when you're old you go there and I'm half new zealand [mah] so <malay>aku</malay> anytime can just like you know [eh]
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something [lah] but I'm not in touch with him that much [lah]
he's a new zealander but <malay>sekarang</malay> he stay in australia
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old [lah] I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains [ah] then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom [lah] there's nothing to do [sia] there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know [lah] okay
no it's not about <malay>mahal</malay> bro even if it's not <malay>mahal</malay> you tell me how much does it cost to get a land to develop your own house to have the rooms that that you want to have entertainment already no
no yes no bro like I said yes but you have to understand <malay>macam mana</malay> if you want to bring the entertainment to you okay for example [lah] like my dream is to have like maybe a a big house over there you know and and (um) I have my own gym my own like like you cinematic rule you know of course ya but right now you ask me I can't even afford the flight ticket to go there bro
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how [sia]
a plan [ah]
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business [lah] [oh] I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no [lah] basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay [lah] I will just give you a brief verbal presentation [ah] people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example [oh] bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why [oh] why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
[ah]
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much [mah]
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
not true you see that's something people don't know it's not true no bro because no no bro that's the thing it's a misconception people don't understand bankruptcy okay let me tell you the most the most popular stigma that people think about bankruptcy okay they will say [oh] my house will <malay>kena tarik</malay> they will say [oh] I cannot get a job and then they will say I cannot travel and then they will say I cannot apply credit card back okay let me give you a check okay so bankruptcy does not affect your house if it's
even if you use bank loan to buy under they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
the only reason how they can <malay>tarik</malay> your house if you never pay for your house that means your never never cut anymore you cannot service your monthly loan then the the can take away your house but banks cannot bro no other companies in on earth can actually pull your away unless
they will just cut your utility [lor]
ya
ya but you know so so first statement okay is a misconception people say your house <malay>kena tarik</malay> not true okay number two (uh) you you cannot travel okay if you see at ministry of law website they will say travel restriction okay you see if you understand how bankruptcy work let's say you apply bankruptcy (uh) I give you one one scenario [lah] one of one of this person [oh] like hundred over thousand so he got bankruptcy but bankruptcy you still have to pay over five years a certain small amount [lah] so like in this guy case is about three hundred a month
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay [lah] you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
because your will still cut [mah] <malay>bulan-bulan</malay> for the house [ah] okay so so normally when people go through bankruptcy that that monthly payment if they pay they can still travel they just need to write in to their official assignee the one attached to their case they write in key in the details and whatever not they have to just submit their case and you just be able to travel bro these other things where okay I tell you [ah] bro you do not be surprised if somebody apply bankruptcy driving a lamborghini bro
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people [lah] okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole [lah] which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor [lah] okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk [mah] you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan [lah] okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets [lah] you know you buy Rolex [lah] you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there [mah]
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions [lah] your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong [lah] but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example [ah] they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government (uh) supreme court order you to pay [lah] like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under under the the negative zone [lah] that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit or bankruptcy right
bankruptcy they will for five to nine years [lah] depending on the amount that you have to pay (err) so for those who still maintain their monthly payment they can still travel but there are people who owe such a large amount that their monthly bankruptcy is still high probably thousand thousand plus a month so that [one] right they are the people like [ah] fuck it [lah] I don't want to pay <malay>aku tak nak bayar kau nak buat apa kau buat</malay> [ah] so if they never pay then they cannot travel
they have to stay in singapore [ah]
cannot [ah]
their their their passport is blocked [what] they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your
but you have to do it ahead [lah] you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go [lah] you know
ya
but it's not like so long in advance <malay>pun</malay> you know it's just like a day probably you know [ah] but the thing is people thought [oh] cannot that kind of thing
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective most probably government will not hire you (uh) they cannot [lah] they will not hire you and probably if you apply for executive job okay [lah] they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy [ah] so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna (uh) work in production houses if the company feel like [eh] there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you [lor] private entity [what]
[ah] so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
[ah] like this kind of job [ah] the one that is got profile [one] [ah] they normally will not hire you [one]
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system [lah] ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests [ah]
ya [lah] for example okay I give you a scenario [ah] let's say you owe ten thousand [lah] the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred [lah]
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month [lah] okay
okay so two per cent of nine thousand seven it will <malay>tambah balik</malay> one nine four so you only end up paying one zero six per month so you will take four years eight months to clear ten thousand if you can only pay three hundred this is the best case scenario [lah] so imagine if people who owe forty fifty thousand okay [lah] let's say you you a newly married couple [lah] okay you you buy a house interior renovation design courts all this one time you spend can thirty forty fifty thousand already every month you must pay thousand plus two loans [mah]
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial (uh) the debt trap [ah] okay so the second way is to pay a minimum [eh]
okay already but it's not one hour not yet not yet a few more minutes okay okay <malay>habis</malay> [kan] another thing [kan] <malay>macam</malay> the second way let's say <malay>macam</malay> the minimum [eh] some people easily already every month must service this much so they cannot afford some because why they don't you don't forget if they got baby they got expenses the <malay>susu</malay> pampers all these things you know so your expenses might be a lot and your disposable income probably to three hundred only how you gonna pay this is when suddenly debt collector come [lah] lawyer letter come [lah]
so all these things we will educate our clients K what happens when debt collector chase you what happens when lawyer letter arrive when should you panic when should you not panic [ah] this is my the job of the debt solution centre we educate them on the law so the third option is when you need help you go you go mendaki you go see [lah] they will refer you to this place called credit counselling singapore no no no no is formed by the union of banks all the banks got together people thought it's a government body but it's not so why do they pushed this first even if you go or whatever because the economical structure of every country bro the biggest tax contributors are the banks so if people pay the banks the more they can tax the banks the more money goes to the country so it's better for the country [lah] [ah] so [ah] normally they have their debt consolidation plan [lah] that debt management program [lah] all these thing [lah] this is by the by the banks [lah] of course they still have interest okay the fourth way is the last resort which is avoid avoiding of bankruptcy through debt repayment scheme so that repayment scheme there's criteria [lah] you know you are [eh] <malay>aku rasa dah habis</malay> [ah] bro okay [lah] five second we count down you have anymore second bro okay okay done [ah] okay

hi [eh] is simon angry at me for making you guys wait
is she okay

I think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them <malay>macam</malay> everything [tau] you list down from A to Z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to (uh) and then you also include like you you (um) <malay>macam</malay> if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will open it till twenty twenty one then like how [sia] you <malay>nak macam</malay> it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects [lah] like you still going to lose money [sia]
and at this time [leh] <malay>macam</malay>
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put (uh) a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that [oh] because company also need need to earn money how can you put that over a an individual's loss
<malay>macam</malay> like you lost thousands of money [eh] just because like [orh] the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
ya you didn't get any of the products
!wah! I will angry [sia]
ya
it's not even your fault [sia] it's not even your you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been (uh) how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the <malay>majlis</malay> are over like you get <malay>duit salam</malay> you know
I told #aqil# I had no expectations like <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin</malay> [ah] but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time [ah] cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak nak macam</malay> okay I need to find a man <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh kahwin</malay> no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will (uh) fall into place [lah] like if if we <malay>kahwin</malay> then <malay>kahwin</malay> like but ultimately I feel like (uh) it's important that #aqil# and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting [ah] of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah]
[oh] you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
(err) like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
because we are exclusive <malay>kita tak cakap</malay> we we <malay>kita tak berbual dengan orang lain</malay> like we love each other like we see a future in each other <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so he say [ah] like let's celebrate or officiate (um) <malay>hujung tahun</malay>
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I <malay>tak biasa</malay> like him looking at my phone
he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> text he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I <malay>nak tengok</malay> your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all (ugh) in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
[oh] right so anyway like in december he <malay>kata</malay> like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I <malay>macam</malay> [oh] then he <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia dah</malay> start saving like he's very (uh) thrifty like
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him [lah] he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like [oh]
just like
I think it's quite cute [lah] like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right (um) the last girlfriend [ah] he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you do you want to be my girlfriend I was like [oh] so like to him it means a lot [lah] that he ask me then I was like [orh] okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
(um) also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with #hassan#
me I still have unresolved issues with #hassan#
like a lot of things happen because of him like <malay>macam</malay> me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
ya we're still not talking [tau] babe
then I was really sad cause during my birthday <malay>dorang tak</malay> wish I (um)
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover !wah! I felt like the shittiest daughter ever [sia] babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like [ah] loose threads or like (uh) consequences on some like those aftermath of me and #hassan# that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with #aqil# and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with #aqil# I want to be with #aqil# only and not have like [oh] this is because of #hassan# that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about #hassan# like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
I know like I know he's an adult like I know <malay>dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar</malay> like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
take care of himself
I think so [ah] because like he was a great boyfriend [sia] babe only things things messed up after the relationship
so like I was so sure of #hassan# [ah] I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him [oh] my god okay I <malay>nak bilang</malay> you something [ah] yesterday yesterday <malay>semalam</malay> I told #aqil# this I say I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> #aqil# (um)
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year [ah]
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way [sia] babe like
like the thing with #hassan# all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet #aqil# and this is going to happen
ya
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things like how things (um) <malay>tertulis</malay> [ah] [lah] like is everything <malay>tertulis</malay> [what] like
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time [ah] babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and #aqil#
<malay>belum</malay> I <malay>belum</malay> delete I still I still <malay>masih ada kat</malay> phone
<malay>dekat my</malay> phone
<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tak tahu asal</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> delete
I I <malay>tak nak tengok</malay> [ah] the <malay>gambar-gambar</malay> like it makes
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
<malay>kau nak</malay> but
ya I don't know [ah] like
I mean I really really hope #hassan#
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness [ah] babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship [lah] after that I don't know what happened
right
(uh) after after #hassan#
cause you were still with #audi# and then like we went out remember you me #hassan# you me #hassan# #audi# ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so [eh] babe
(uh) like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like (um) cold like he's very (err) like
[ah] very action [ah]
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like (uh) when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then (err) he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder [ah] like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
that's like trying to be <malay>macam</malay> they are trying to
be someone that they're not
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) <malay>dah kahwin</malay> after a few after a few years <malay>dah penat</malay> like pretend to be someone that you're not
then their true form comes out !wah! scary [ah]
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
[ah]
okay
<malay>cakap melayu</malay> [lah] okay so <malay>itu saja tentang</malay> #hassan#

I am not complaining [ah] cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I <malay>tak</malay> complain [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>pun nak</malay> aircon the <malay>kereta dia</malay> anyway so up to you [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> on aircon I okay [jer] you <malay>nak</malay> waste <malay>nak</malay> waste gas
<malay>nanti</malay>
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
but I think one thing that I need to like (um) get used to is <malay>dia punya cemburu</malay>
<malay>cemburu</malay>
like his jealousy
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person <malay>dia cakap dia tak</malay> jealous <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>cakap pasal</malay> like my guy friends or like #shah# #shah# [sia] #shah# is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I <malay>tak</malay> jealous <malay>pasal</malay> like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
#firdaus# is an idiot
like to me it's like (uh) old friends that's fine if you if you found a new girlfriend that [one] I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dengan dorang</malay> you <malay>dah lama dah dengan dorang</malay>
ya
so like the fact that you and <malay>dorang tak</malay> together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything [lah] between you
you know
we got seven more minutes
I <malay>punya</malay> timer five three two eight
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce #aqil# to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
[orh] <malay>pasal</malay> #aqil# <malay>tak</malay> practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
he was saying like I love your daughter I'm working hard [ah] to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like !oof! damn cause he <malay>dulu tak pernah puasa</malay> then he say for the last two years he's been <malay>puasa</malay> full [lah]
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like [oh] my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like #aqil# like morals also questionable
like he [ah] he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who who do that also
especially practising muslim so <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] but <malay>macam</malay> I have friends who like drink but then they go <malay>solat jumaat</malay>
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like <malay>dia dia punya</malay>
<malay>pendirian</malay> [ah] like <malay>dia rasa</malay> like it's okay for him to do it because <malay>dia tak</malay> practise he's not a practising muslim <malay>tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia</malay> practise practise religion then <malay>itu salah</malay> so like I don't wanna ya so like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay like that's your view too
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
<malay>gasak kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> you you <malay>dah besar</malay> you <malay>tahu apa salah apa betul apa</malay> so I <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nak buat apa</malay>
not my responsible to <malay>tegur</malay> you because you <malay>dah tahu</malay> all this you <malay>dah tahu</malay> and like <malay>siapa</malay> I <malay>nak tegur</malay> you know
ya
so I think part <malay>yang dia</malay> like in terms of I'm just scared <malay>macam</malay> my parents <malay>ada</malay> high expectations on #aqil# like they
they <malay>nak ni nak tu</malay> then they will they will I scared they feel like #aqil# is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I <malay>yang nak kahwin</malay> [pe]
ya
right
I think my my parents <malay>punya</malay> fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life [lah] like once <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>meninggal</malay> like you know that kind of thing
(mm)
<malay>macam tak</malay> sincere [jer]
your mum
ya
[eh] how's your mum is she okay
(err) I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
(uh)
most likely early next year
or mid next year
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our <malay>macam</malay> we will start planning [lah] like properly <malay>macam</malay>
apply for house then like (um) because #aqil# just started working so his is <malay>tak banyak</malay>
but I told him [ah] like my is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like [oh] no [lah] but like he wants to
then I say it's fine (um) like we can like plan [lah] like
I feel like I feel like #aqil# is very very reasonable <malay>dan dia punya</malay> like
<malay>dia tak macam kata dia kata dia</malay> [tau] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>dia dia</malay> will <malay>dengar cakap orang</malay> then after that he will like process and then he would
try to understand and see other people's view [ah] like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with
<malay>macam</malay> be with
like as a partner <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia faham</malay> like the what is understanding in malay babe
<malay>pecah</malay>

still going strong (ugh)
ya
(mm)
is it I love wearing the mask [eh]
it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
so when I work at events because usually they pay quite high so I don't mind smiling you know like [oh] hi welcome to <malay>apa apa apa</malay> you know then
do [ah] then after that then I will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask [what] then also I think people cannot recognise me so I'm quite happy like I mean not like I famous <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah]
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
you don't want to <malay>tegur</malay> like that then you just like !alamak! <malay>dia ni lagi</malay> then
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them

about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
my friend <malay>dia nak jadi</malay> temperature screener [kan] <malay>dekat kedai tu</malay> [kan]

registered people [ah] usually

they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (uh)

<malay>ngada-ngada</malay> [ah] I don't know how to say

credentials like
I know what I'm doing [lah] basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I (uh) obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do [lah] because
I know how to do [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I managed to pass the test [lah] then she was like okay actually (um) I think you can
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then

sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
but then now I I see like <malay>macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua</malay> I don't know what the hell they are doing but okay [lah] I guess
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
I don't know [eh]
my friends <malay>semua macam</malay> introvert <malay>dengan</malay> homebody <malay>juga</malay> so it was quite fun [lah] for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
you ask them to <malay>jumpa</malay> right like like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually I don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then I suffocated in a sense that
(um)
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
too wild too long in that's why I'm like <malay>macam</malay>
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like I'm the eldest [kan]
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
but then my parents <malay>dia orang macam nak</malay> my sis my younger sister to marry first
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] I think my relationship longer but my relationship (uh) I'm also attached to a non-muslim
so
ya it makes things more complicated [ah] I guess then my sister she <malay>macam</malay>
she attached <malay>dengan</malay> muslim guy so that's already one
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like F&B jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know [eh]
<malay>macam sekarang</malay> right I was thinking like is it
better in the long run if you marry now or better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
marriage is just like <malay>macam</malay>
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
[eh] but then you know what so scary [leh] like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) recently [kan] I <malay>baca kat</malay>
facebook [ah] now now got a lot of free time [what] so more time to browse facebook <malay>gitu semua</malay>
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
!wah! then [ah] so if cause to me right <malay>macam kalau kita</malay> relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
need lawyer need to sign things all <malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
(mm)
is it
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also I don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
I mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] I don't know whether
not like I got married before [lah] but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous [what]
<malay>apa</malay>
sorry what
(uh) <malay>tak</malay> I think they give up on me already
that's why like recently I you know <malay>rajin-rajin</malay> in the kitchen then <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
[oh] (um) #izzati# finally can get married <malay>gitu</malay> you know but then I'm just like
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much <malay>kalau tahu</malay> I just
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
I mean I'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun [lah] but you know at least like now I know that I'm not busy working because I don't think I want to be a working mum when I'm like heavily pregnant <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] I feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) I think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
<malay>apa ni</malay>
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
like #chiongster# also [lah] <malay>kerja banyak</malay> and things like that then my parents also not happy [ah] because like
supposedly twenty five <malay>kita kena dah</malay> married already you know but then I was still like working my ass off [lah]
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy [lah] then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay [lah] like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family [kan] but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] then what !huh!
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
<malay>kita pun ada cakap</malay> [ah] like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far I've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should already
ya because my friend like
they like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
then she say it's like hell [lah] because the mother in-law <malay>macam</malay>
like have a lot of expectations of her <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
(mm)
but sometimes <malay>kecoh</malay> is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of <malay>kecoh</malay>
ya ya
because like
I feel
[oh] okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
I know that's why but I've talked to her before then she <malay>cakap dia tak nak</malay> [ah] she <malay>nak cari rumah sendiri juga</malay>
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
like you know <malay>hari raya</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> like <malay>rumah kat</malay> #jurong# then <malay>mesti ada kucing punya</malay> I don't know [ah] I don't know how to say ya
ya
I never say [ah] <malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> [eh]
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of #jurong#
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
[oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #pasir ris# then I [oh] <malay>pergi</malay> #changi# okay then <malay>pergi</malay> #jurong# [ah] I
!wah! that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
(mmhmm)
yes it's true
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya that's right
(mm)
(hmm) do you like that or not
okay
(mm)
[oh]
those are touch and run away kind ya
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
<malay>seram</malay> [seh]
the what you do
<malay>apa</malay>
what the
[ah] ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
<malay>apa</malay>
watch group !wah! your parents also very ons [eh]
[ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm) interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
[oh] but recently my sister <malay>kena</malay> then I was like what the hell
ya but I don't think I can be like you [lah]
like the last three times (uh) people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
(uh)
more like like I think too well of myself
a bit overconfident [lah] <malay>dia orang kata</malay>
ya
so so it's like I'm like !oi! (uh) why you follow me like you know <malay>padahal</malay> I'm just a
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it [ah] like what you say [ah]
sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> will follow from a distance which I can still like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [lah] you know then
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
there was one guy who even like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan] then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then
[ah] ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door [ah]
and actually because I want to lean [ah] because I <malay>malas</malay>
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya !oops! I cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so I'm just like [oh] I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
recently [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> I want to move to the west side because
most of the not most of the jobs that I want [lah] but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang mo kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
ya so it's like <malay>macam</malay> I feel like if I live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
I mean not easier [lah] it will be
life you know like sometimes the the <malay>kerja</malay> is like so far away from your <malay>rumah</malay> then it's like (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> ya
so ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think if I'm nearer to the west I probably won't (uh) what
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
I cannot [lah] I I just for me I feel I get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
ya [lah] cause in #ang mo kio# like <malay>macam</malay> nobody ever sleeps
so it's damn irritating
then sometimes like three [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon</malay> then <malay>dia orang ketawa</malay> like laugh their heart out then I feel like so irritated you know
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
I don't know [ah] I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID [lah] so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
<malay>apa</malay>
my plan
[a'ah]
but I think he don't want [lah]
because he also still studying then he want to like (uh) like what you say [lah] <malay>macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu</malay>
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
<malay>sebab dia nak jadi</malay> teacher so now he studying the subject
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
because he wants to work at <malay>punya</malay> kind of school
then I'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't <malay>kerja</malay> you know so I have I probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
say before that he is <malay>macam</malay>
like when he got school [kan] <malay>dia nak</malay>
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
(uh) but then that semester break it I think is is <malay>macam</malay> charity
that's why just like normal expenditure [kan] it's not like saving for a house <malay>gitu</malay> you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes I wish I just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
[ah] <malay>cina</malay> [lah]
(uh) #qian jin# is a
actually I don't
I don't know [ah] like when back then like cause I was your age not so long ago (um)
I was workaholic also [lah] then <malay>macam</malay>
not really keen on getting married or getting attached even
you know so I'm just like
whatever [lah] actually I was kind of those kind like [oh] I I independent woman I <malay>tak nak kahwin tak nak</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> children all then in the end
I met him then I was like actually we can click [ah] then like so we fall
like in love so like not I'm in a relationship
so I don't know what to do with that dream
(mm)
what
online [lah]
[a'ah]
<malay>saje</malay> [jer] like you know like
like
try try cause nowadays got <malay>macam banyak</malay> apps <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] you know and websites also
so just make friends [ah] because I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
my age [kan] like <malay>orang semua dah kahwin</malay> then <malay>dia orang macam tak nak</malay> hang out so much
so I was like trying to like meet new people like of same interests as me you know
then
no no twenty five was when I don't want to get married
so in that course then I'm just like ya but then now it's like
I suddenly meet him then suddenly like [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] actually like if we get married and have a life together <malay>macam</malay> fun <malay>gitu juga</malay> [eh] ya so
you have to think about the past and everything
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
!whoa!
how you meet yours
[oh] you never tell me <malay>sekolah</malay> [oh] okay okay
[eh] we should add each other up on like game platforms [sia]

(mm) ya I don't play fortnite
I mean I mean I've never play [ah] I don't know how it's like so ya
(mm)
like what
[oh]
(mm)
I will not last long in that
(mm) I think because of COVID right
I downloaded animal crossing so now I'm still addicted to it
ya
(mm)

you know
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay

ya
[oh] what it's just the same games over and over again [lah]
don't have
(uh) I don't even know what I want to call it
I guess you can say that !huh!
(uh)

(err) my day today was okay it was quite a slow day (uh)
because I didn't do much (uh) today
(um) I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work [lah]
I haven't actually applied for anything
(err) I was there was this (err) job link that #adli# sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
(err)
the job <malay>punya</malay> name if I'm not wrong it was <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly [lah] but then there was an addendum to the title
that said (uh) it was (uh)
malay language specialist
it should be [ah] or <malay>siapa-siapa yang boleh faham</malay> [ah] <malay>melayu</malay>
ya but the job <malay>punya</malay>
the job <malay>punya</malay> description !wah! was not that not that bad (uh)
basically just listen to
transcriptions [oh] sorry (err) listen to audio <malay>punya</malay> files
and then
transcribe them into
words [ah]
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
no I think it's like maybe <malay>macam</malay> <malay>punya</malay> type of thing (uh)
(err) natural language processing
ya ya basically [ah] but I think there's also another aspect of <malay>macam</malay>
(err) natural language processing <malay>punya</malay>
feel
which is more concern with (err) and machine learning
where the
the itself
actually (err) learns language
because [kan] you know <malay>ada ada</malay> debate [kan] whether language is
(err) nature or nurture <malay>macam</malay> whether there is a biological foundation for language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then (err)
so
so ya [lah] the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
the brain <malay>punya</malay> mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to ke <malay>tak</malay> whether the can learn
[ah] yes I will be part of that
[a'ah]
soon [lah] in a few days [lah] I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
because my results [kan] <malay>belum keluar</malay>
so like
I got no results
the
if I apply then like a bit weird (uh) but I'm quite sure I will pass [lah] so I think <malay>tak ada hal kalau nak</malay> apply [jer]
(err)
so far no (uh) except for a few that I saw (err)
special education <malay>punya</malay> teacher
<malay>kat</malay>
(err) wherever [lah] I think there's a few locations
because I fall into the <malay>macam</malay> the
no like (err) I I meet the requirements ya
(mm)
okay [lah] the exam was
only one exam was quite difficult (uh) the other three <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] (uh) okay [ah] I did two of them quite well (err)
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and (err) second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy (uh)
the best [eh]
probably second language learning
!huh! why
no (uh) because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory [what] so it's more difficult to screw up
but at the same time <malay>kalau dia</malay> rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest <malay>punya</malay> score possible
ya ya I just want to pass
(mm) ya
your leave
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
wait pause they made you take
a test
[oh] so <malay>macam</malay> what are your strengths what are your weaknesses <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[ah]
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya your boss's boss
wait he got cut off [oh] because the break up room <malay>punya</malay> time was ending
ya
(mmhmm)
!huh! how come your computer shut down in the room
[oh] so the
so basically the zoom thing crash [lah] nothing wrong with your computer [lah]
okay okay good
<malay>sebarang</malay> [jer] [siol] leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the <malay>benda ni</malay> compulsory [kan]
!whoa!
okay (uh)
I sat in the chair
<malay>belajar belajar</malay> all the way like for hours and hours straight
but it's okay [lah] I mean I managed to
(err) get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was (err)
for the eighteenth century <malay>punya</malay> lit
that [one] maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
<malay>tak</malay>
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want [ah]
I mean
it's work for me throughout the four years (uh) for all my lit <malay>punya</malay> courses [ah] plus I hate lit (uh) so
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
<malay>asal</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>apa dia</malay>
[ah]
then he suddenly appears
<malay>menyibuk</malay>
<malay>tak menyibuk</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak cukup</malay>
<malay>tak cukup perhatian</malay>
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift [eh]
(mmhmm)
left <malay>maksud</malay>
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
so
so basically there was no person in charge [lah] for the thing
!wah! co in charge [lah]
on the ups
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
after six
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] <malay>kejap</malay> pause
but the appointment <malay>pukul enam pagi</malay>
[oh] okay okay
<malay>nak kena siap apa</malay> [seh] you just need to go over to the location [pe]
ya
(hmm)
so he's new
[ah]
(mm)
okay so he's not actually <malay>baru</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
[oh]
so so your shift doesn't deal with <malay>macam</malay> <malay>punya barang-barang</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> and (oo)
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
[eh] to whoever's listening
confidential okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> lost [ah]
the what thing
[oh] okay
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
(mm) (err) on the days you're schooling
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya
okay shift is what time to what time
<malay>tiga pagi juga</malay>
you
[oh] you cannot request for shift change [eh]
[oh] for your class [eh]
[eh] I think I destroyed your chair
[oh] okay
<malay>kita orang macam</malay> chair destroyers [eh]
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
(mm)
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
I mean even on your off days also most likely <malay>kena tidur</malay> [kan]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
it's like a fake fake off not I think it's a I think it's a shift <malay>punya</malay> thing (uh) <malay>pasal dulu</malay> #nasri# <malay>pun bila dia tengah kerja</malay> shift
I think you felt the same way in that
<malay>macam</malay> even on his off days his time was taken up by
<malay>tidur dulu</malay> because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
take a break if that makes sense
(mmhmm)
[oh] shit serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
justin bieber
[oh]
[oh] they are not big fans of justin bieber
(mm)
wait so so you mean different <malay>punya</malay> clients
have different workflows [eh]
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
[oh] ya [lah]
you better do it
ya
serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit (err)
weird
I think especially because <malay>macam lain-lain punya</malay> organisation <malay>ada lain-lain punya</malay> processes
so <malay>macam</malay>
like
there's no
solid base to work from within your own organisational <malay>punya itu</malay>
like it's dependent on the client rather than the <malay>itu</malay>
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you (uh)
the previous shift
<malay>terlalu banyak apa</malay>
complacent [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
I don't know (uh) I think
honestly to me
<malay>janji kerja dia habis dah habis cerita</malay>
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send (uh)
in what sense
(mm)
what what do you mean <malay>kena macam tu</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
first come first serve <malay>siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
(mm)
wait
<malay>pukul lima</malay> five in the morning
okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
ya like you
and you don't want to be the kind <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tanya tanya tanya macam</malay> !oi! you want or not [eh] you want or not <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
like I have a feeling like usually the one <malay>yang</malay> step up is you and not all all those other people <malay>yang itu</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>ada apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
jaded
(mm)
[oh] okay
I was actually going to make a joke
<malay>pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>ada apa budak baru nama</malay> jaden [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> seniors <malay>dia</malay> jaded
so jaden <malay>dengan</malay> jaded <malay>sama-sama</malay>
never mind never mind let them cringe <malay>janji janji kita punya</malay> audio <malay>dorang dapat</malay>
[ah] okay [lah]
<malay>betul tak betul betul</malay>
(mm)
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
!huh!
ya ya they know we we also know
no no no it's like it's like <malay>bila kita orang dua orang</malay> [jer] <malay>berbual macam</malay>
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
<malay>kalau orang melayu apa</malay> [ah]
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker [eh]
no no there's there's
<malay>ada ada ada</malay> there's a there's a (uh) there's a phrase I think for for home wreckers
<malay>macam</malay> like like [ah] is it
is it <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I think it's <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
ya there's
no now that one person has more (uh)
malay vocabulary to transcribe
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean we we're having
<malay>macam</malay>
ya ya
I don't know (uh) but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
[kan] it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine [ah] it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable [lah]
!aiya!
[ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
I mean maybe the design of <malay>dia punya</malay> blocks also plays a part [lah]
but at the same time <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time <malay>orang nak balik rumah</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] of course [lah] it's their job
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>orang sia-sia</malay> [jer] <malay>ketuk-ketuk</malay> [siol]
just anime like
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] anime
#weeaboo# <malay>kalau melayu apa</malay> #weeaboo#
<malay>kalau</malay> indo #weeaboo#
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching (um)
<malay>apa</malay>
(err) Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
(err)
part <malay>dia pun belum sampai dalam</malay> anime <malay>dia</malay>
(err) there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
they had they had to stop for a while <malay>pasal</malay> COVID
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
(uh) apparently january next year in japan [lah] <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah]
maybe add three or four months
[ah] ya
in japan
[oh]
but (mm)
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file [ah]
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own <malay>macam</malay>
cinema <malay>punya</malay> based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
cloud
[oh] ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one [ah]
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
artefacts
(err) to do with the film [ah] let's say <malay>macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit</malay> then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself <malay>abeh nanti macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya tu</malay>
but but then again
ya ya that's the thing <malay>macam kalau</malay> film it's like
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel <malay>punya</malay> density
like with digital all like you are constrained by <malay>dia punya</malay>
the pixels [ah] and the resolution that it was framed at [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know lord of the rings
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
is because <malay>dia punya</malay> digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands (uh) two thousand one to two thousand and four
<malay>ada apa</malay>
<malay>dah ada apa</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] but it weren't limited like if you if you film
the actual film
like
(err) like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
but all the and the extra extra <malay>punya barang-barang</malay>
was (err) ten eighty P <malay>punya</malay> rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya</malay> effects
or whether <malay>dorang nak apa</malay>
(err) just use the existing <malay>punya</malay> rendering
and then upscale to four K <malay>tapi macam buruk</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> zoom zoom in <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] that's the kind of effect
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>macam</malay> stretched <malay>gitu</malay>
or like something someone would draw in paint
<malay>tak kasi dia makan dulu</malay>
<malay>tunggu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the [kan] the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
(err)
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
!huh!
I mean you have an eye for the frame [what]
[ah] ya [lah] you have an eye for the frame I will write I will write in the script <malay>macam mana dia punya</malay> scene develops
and then after that you will get like
you know like the three quarter removed <malay>punya</malay> angle or like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things (uh) like
<malay>macam</malay> the #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay>
stanley #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay> follow through the halls
behind ya that kind of shot [ah]
(mm)
A U T E U R [eh]
[a'ah]
#auteur#
ya
but
no <malay>tak nak tak nak</malay>
(err) anything [ah] can also (uh)
<malay>tapi macam kenyang</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] Gong Cha
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
how to work the camera to achieve that <malay>itu</malay>
flexible
in what sense
(mm)
okay ya
(mm)
[oh] to get [ah] ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
I think director director <malay>macam gitu</malay> is
<malay>dorang dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> successful <malay>dah ada banyak duit</malay> then
the ego that comes with it is <malay>itu</malay> (uh)
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and (err) location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
I think it can go anywhere [ah] doesn't necessarily have to be <malay>macam</malay>
horror or <malay>itu</malay> it can be like it can be like drama
but with
a
psychological (uh) age not twist [ah] like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about [ah]
that looking into the
the person and the nature of the person <malay>macam</malay> who are you <malay>gitu</malay>
(err)
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay [ah] stimulating [ah] but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like (um)
like you know Annihilation
ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
<malay>macam</malay> telling you
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and (err)
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
(err) three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
the the thing that I like about the original <malay>punya</malay> jurassic park is
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
that that (err) that <malay>apa</malay>
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
it kind of moves beyond <malay>macam</malay> like what what constitutes
through
(err) power
you know and like
a display of real fear
like how you know there was a scene of the guy <malay>yang dia dia</malay>
(err) <malay>apa ada</malay> T-rex
then after that <malay>dia</malay> abandoned <malay>budak-budak</malay> then after that <malay>dia terus dia lari masuk</malay> toilet then T-rex <malay>gigit kepala dia</malay>
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
(err)
let's see
[ah] the wailing
the wailing
it's like
it's like (err) <malay>macam</malay>
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
(mm)
I think I think they
go to the house
ya
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya ya [a'ah]
(mm)
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail [ah]
I only remember the beautiful shots of the <malay>itu</malay>
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also <malay>macam lawa gitu</malay>
it's very <malay>macam</malay> ethereal
<malay>mana satu</malay>
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
[oh] ya that's okay okay we watched that [one]
we watched that [one] in the cinema (uh)
I cannot remember but it was the director of <malay>pengabdi setan</malay>
but I I want to watch <malay>pengabdi setan</malay> [ah] where to watch [ah]
<malay>malam ni</malay>
nevermind [ah]
I think that [one] will I probably will have to watch with #rehan# lights off speakers on
[oh]
(mm)
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it [ah]
because I I took the scriptwriting <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>apa</malay>
[eh] I got A you know don't play play you know
you make the film I write the script <malay>dah</malay> settle [ah]
director of photography [ah]
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
[ah]
no you know no
no [lah] we do it we do it properly [lah] but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from (err) getting
(uh) machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
[oh] ya
no need [ah] low budget [ah] indie
live what
no [lah] it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no [lah]
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free [lah]
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
[oh] ya correct correct
okay [lah] then when we on our off day then we do [ah]
I think can can no worry can be done
[oh] ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive
not anytime soon [lah]
like next year
like next year because <malay>tu apa tu</malay>
(uh) my hot [ah]
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
like my monitor <malay>punya</malay> resolution <malay>terlalu tinggi</malay> for the for the card
so <malay>macam</malay> I need a stronger card
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or [what]
[ah] whatever game you can try you try [ah]
(mm) you never try Borderland three
buy [ah]
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm <malay>murah punya</malay> maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
I know #rehan# that time buy on sale thirty seven <malay>murah</malay>
for the for the release price [lah] the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday [eh]
what you buy
[oh] ya
[oh] ya later [ah] later
masks
yes
<malay>dah sampai</malay>
compress
<malay>semprot</malay>
okay [lah]
[oh] okay
!huh!
I want to I want to take one
#nezuko#
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation [ah]
ya [lah] so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the #weeaboos# it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
that's why it's so <malay>macam itu</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> I don't like it [ah] because all the <malay>mat reps semua macam tengok macam</malay> (uh) demon slayer demon slayer
then I'm like bro you don't know what the #weeaboos# go through
I think
(mm)
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic [ah] in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
[oh] no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
(mm)
(uh) #haikyu# is not that
(mm)
<malay>tu semua</malay>
<malay>boleh beli dari</malay> AliExpress [pe]
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
#oregairu#
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
of the thing because it's actually <malay>dia macam</malay>
grounded in realism
<malay>macam</malay> with real respect for people <malay>punya</malay> feelings and not just some
random rom com <malay>yang dorang macam sebarang</malay> #rojak# <malay>letak kat dalam ni semua abeh</malay> mix mix mix <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>janji kelakar habis</malay> [ah]
ya like it was well thought out and well written [ah]
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season [ah]
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
(mm)
but at the same time like you must also consider <malay>macam kat</malay> japan [kan]
how it works is usually
<malay>yang</malay> the source material <malay>dorang punya</malay> #manga# <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> light novel <malay>ke</malay> visual novel <malay>ke</malay> [pe]
has to be actually very popular <malay>dalam</malay> its own format
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
or <malay>sampah habis</malay>
ya
so that's basically how it works (uh)
(mm)
different <malay>ke</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
[oh]
so <malay>sahaja</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>dia ambil</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
(mm)
J drama
(mm)
[ah] I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas [eh]
(mmhmm)
makeup
[oh] <malay>dia muda</malay> [eh]

<malay>paling selamat macam</malay>
wait <malay>dia tinggal kat mana</malay>
as in as in in indonesia <malay>dia tinggal kat mana</malay>
[oh] I mean #jakarta# is the city [pe]

the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
<malay>boleh</malay> [eh]
try (uh) <malay>nanti</malay>
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time [eh] <malay>kita kita cari</malay> korean <malay>punya</malay> movie
[ah] then after that I I I off I off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me

<malay>macam</malay> hyperinflation
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
(mm)
[oh] yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
came first <malay>sebelum</malay> writing
(mm)
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of (err) child language development
ya I learnt that
[ah]
#koreaboo#
but [oh] ya the key caps
<malay>dia punya</malay> shine through <malay>lawa tak</malay>
!wah!

I don't know whether you experience that before some shops okay and then some shops <malay>tak</malay> okay I'm like really like come on [lah] like give chance a bit [lah] like you know but I guess everyone has to take it seriously [lah] that is true <malay>tapi macam kelakar</malay> because at the beginning <malay>bila</malay> this started <malay>semua orang macam</malay> !alamak! #kanchiong# #kanchiong# spider you know <malay>macam</malay> !alamak!
okay how [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to check in how know contact tracing [lah] this and that and then after that after awhile
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
(hmm)
I think right the best <malay>kalau ada duit beli</malay> online <malay>sudah</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>betul memang memang</malay> my mum also experience that before <malay>dia beli apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kelakar</malay> it's not just <malay>baju</malay> [eh] it's like <malay>barang-barang rumah sekali</malay> after that <malay>dia punya</malay> colour <malay>lain</malay> and then <malay>dia punya</malay> size <malay>pun lain</malay>
<malay>ada boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> all those order <malay>macam</malay> order from china all that how to how to return back [seh]

and then <malay>sekali datang</malay> like that time okay it's funny that time [eh] I'm sure you <malay>mesti</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> story <malay>pasal</malay> like failed grab delivery <malay>punya apa tu</malay>
(err)
<malay>punya</malay> orders my god my my time <malay>bila</malay> I mean my experience so far is like [oh] my god
like it's really crazy like okay example [leh] that time I <malay>beli ayam penyet</malay> and then you know what happen <malay>nasi tak datang boleh gitu</malay> order <malay>ayam penyet nasi ayam penyet</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi nasi</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> and then <malay>bila bila</malay> complain <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> firstly <malay>dia orang tak angkat</malay> phone <malay>abeh dah dah gitu</malay> and then <malay>nak tanya</malay> [lah]
<malay>mana mana nasi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi ayam penyet mana ada orang</malay> order <malay>nasi lemak tak ada nasi</malay> order <malay>nasi ayam tak ada nasi tak kelakar</malay>
and then <malay>dah lapar</malay> and then after that <malay>dia orang boleh cakap</malay> [oh] I think the <malay>nasi dia orang</malay> either <malay>dia orang lupa atau</malay> driver <malay>makan</malay> !huh! <malay>tak</malay> I don't know <malay>nak mengamuk ke nak ketawa ke nak apa</malay>
you imagine if it's you <malay>kalau</malay> if it's your if you are in my shoes <malay>tak marah</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> <malay>nak tunggukan nasi</malay> and then <malay>takkan</malay> so the the <malay>kelakar</malay> part is the <malay>kelakar</malay> part of the story is what know
<malay>bila</malay> I call them to go and say that <malay>the nasi tak ada</malay> and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> so you want me to refund you the rice or you want me to refund you the money so I said you have experience before or not the rice never come with your meal
and then they they said (err) depends [ah] ma'am depends I said !huh!
depends on what I don't know whether to let's say [ah] <malay>tak tahu nak mengamuk ke nak marah ke</malay> and then
<malay>kalau nak tunggu nasi dia cakap apa</malay> [tau] <malay>dia cakap</malay> ma'am because right the restaurant (err) a lot of order [ah] ma'am and then the driver also not many so you have to wait [ah] maybe one or two hours <malay>untuk satu nasi</malay> I'm like [ah]
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] in the end my mum <malay>masak nasi sendiri</malay> [ah] so thanks [lah] so I then but the funny part is one week later this they send me email to say that hi ma'am we have refund you the money for the rice that's all so it's you know how much is the rice one dollar twenty cent thank you thanks grab
<malay>satu jam</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>mesti dah</malay>
<malay>dah membara</malay> you know like <malay>dah lapar abeh dah mengamuk</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> still <malay>nak tunggu satu jam</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah sudah tak payah sudah itu beli</malay> mcdonald's <malay>sudah</malay>
circuit breaker ya [orh]
ya [lah] <malay>masak nak masak boleh tapi nak nak</malay> clean up <malay>tu nak bersihkan</malay> [eh] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
[ah] !wah! <malay>mesti</malay> crowded <malay>gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>abeh</malay> !huh! cancel
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mm) on that day itself [ah] [orh] okay okay
[eh] [eh] <malay>jahatnya sedih</malay>
(mm) (mm)
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing [seh] it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job [lah] basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like (uh) mcdonald's then okay ya (err) like customer number one two three four and then they just say [ah] ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
(mm)
so I think also <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> the restaurant <malay>nak</malay> blame the driver and then the driver blame the restaurant then in the end <malay>siapa yang</malay> suffer [seh]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia punya gaji bukannya berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kesian</malay> (mm) (mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean I <malay>selalu tengok dia orang penat-penat datang dengan basikal</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan</malay> motor [lah] <malay>dengan kereta</malay> [lah] and then
<malay>selalu macam</malay> you can see that they're always in a rush like they're always like trying to go that trying to hurry themselves to the next delivery you know what I mean
ya so <malay>macam nak mengamuk-mengamuk dengan dia orang pun</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam susah</malay> you know <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam memang memang ni dia orang punya dia orang punya</malay>
<malay>apa tu dia orang punya</malay> job [lah] like <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> let's say so is like I feel in the end the restaurant they blame the driver and then driver blame restaurant then in the end customer suffer [lah]
(mm)
[eh] [eh] <malay>baiknya</malay> [lah] [eh] [eh] <malay>siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>tak nak pergi rumah dia gitu</malay> as in tip in cash or !huh! [oh] my god
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat lambat kenapa ni kenapa tu semua</malay> still <malay>ada</malay> comment [lah] singaporeans standard [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>bukan</malay> singaporean <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay> order <malay>macam</malay> like that time <malay>baru</malay> my friend order <malay>apa</malay> [eh] I think <malay>dia</malay> order
<malay>susah kalau</malay> I mean that time my friend <malay>pun cakap cakap pasal nasi padang</malay> [eh] that time my friend order during <malay>bulan puasa</malay> [ah] during fasting month ramadan time I think just like two three months ago and then they order in bulk [lah] because <malay>dia orang ada macam</malay>
<malay>apa macam</malay> (err) open house [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> open house <malay>macam</malay>
(err) family gathering I mean as as small as the gathering can be [lah] you know following the guidelines and all that and then the funny part is <malay>dia hantar banyak rumah</malay> so they order <malay>macam</malay> maybe like four packet like <malay>empat</malay> packet <malay>satu rumah</malay>
so altogether maybe about <malay>empat puluh</malay> packet they just put you know [lah]
malay family <malay>banyak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia baik hati</malay> [lah] because like one of the days <malay>dia nak macam dia nak apa tu nak belanja nak belanja makan</malay> so they order to ten household and then out of the ten maybe half of the <malay>makanan basi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya sayur dia bungkus sekali sayur dia boleh basi</malay> and then <malay>macam mana bulan puasa orang nak orang nak buka nak makan</malay>
so <malay>dia punya</malay> order <malay>datang pukul empat</malay>
and then <malay>dia buka pukul tujuh tujuh tujuh setengah tujuh lima belas</malay> and then after that <malay>makanan dia basi</malay> so <malay>satu hari puasa abeh makanan basi tak sedih</malay>
[ah] <malay>abeh yang kelakar punya yang</malay> the the funniest part of all is that the owner of that coffee I mean of that (err) food stall <malay>dia boleh cakap apa</malay> [tau] [oh] (err) sorry [ah] to customer who got the food that is <malay>basi</malay>
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business !huh!
<malay>tak</malay>
[ah] [ah] so also <malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] because okay [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> restaurant maybe
maybe they can give you <malay>macam</malay> a bit of refund or what [lah] but because they are
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like !huh!
correct and then <malay>nasi</malay> I mean okay <malay>nasi padang</malay> [eh] maybe on average maybe about five dollars but during the fasting month [eh] plus the delivery and everything my my friend paid about hundred plus [tau] then imagine half of the <malay>nasi basi macam mana gitu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tak ada tak ada tak ada</malay> refund <malay>tak ada dia boleh cakap</malay> [oh] we just hope the customer can understand and that's it so ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian</malay> and then it's like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pergi mana</malay> cycling <malay>kat mana</malay> [seh]
<malay>boleh juga</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tapi esok</malay> sunday [seh] confirm <malay>banyak orang</malay>
[oh] <malay>masih</malay>
[ah] [ah] <malay>sama</malay> mountain bike [ah] <malay>sama tak tak tak tukar</malay>

(mm) (mm) true [lah]
(mm) (mm) I think <malay>sekarang</malay> that day I think what <malay>lima puluh</malay> or something like that

six five or six stalls there right that <malay>jual nasi lemak</malay> or is it is it more than that I can't remember <malay>dah lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak pergi makan</malay> #changi# <malay>tapi</malay> as usual <malay>kalau nak tanya orang</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> best <malay>nasi lemak semua</malay> best [ah] depends [ah] <malay>yang mana</malay> depends on <malay>apa</malay> like you <malay>suka tapi</malay> more or less <malay>sama apa selalu nasi ayam ikan timun sambal dah</malay> [kan] <malay>apa apa yang beza dia</malay>
[kan] unless it's <malay>sama apa kalau nasi lemak</malay> I mean okay [lah] the good thing is that <malay>dia punya</malay> price there is like <malay>macam dua</malay> I think two dollars three dollars maybe ya

[ah] [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] it's like and then <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] because nowadays <malay>bila panas</malay> very hot and then when it's raining it's like raining like flooded did you saw that time <malay>dekat dekat</malay> singapore I think <malay>kat mana entah</malay> #changi# <malay>ke</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>ke</malay> #bedok# the rain <malay>sampai</malay> flooding <malay>sampai banjir</malay> and then the <malay>banjir</malay> is so bad that
at the bus stop <malay>dia punya orang</malay> is standing on the seat [eh]
and the <malay>air naik</malay> all the way [tau]
<malay>macam bukan kat</malay> singapore [seh]
!huh!
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> [a'ah] <malay>betul betul</malay>
ya and then I saw [seh] <malay>banyak orang macam</malay> video

or phase one or something then the <malay>dia punya</malay> it was so bad that they there was water inside the bus [leh] and then they said they say nevermind it's okay that is close you can still take this bus because the water was like ankle deep you know
can you imagine so it's like you are literally it means if you wear shoes or slippers <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
<malay>basah kuyup</malay> [seh] <malay>habis</malay> [ah]
<malay>kesian</malay> (uh) (uh) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] that's why it's like really not like singapore [seh]
(mm) (mm)
and then means weather forecast <malay>semua salah</malay> [lah]
thanks [eh]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] like today I saw the weather forecast actually suppose to rain <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually suppose <malay>hujan sampai</malay> tuesday [ah] next tuesday tuesday or wednesday then today <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>panas mana tak</malay> dengue <malay>kat</malay> singapore
[ah] maybe [lah] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
weird [leh] no but talking about dengue [oh] my god seriously the dengue cases did you saw I was just I was just telling my friend that day <malay>pasal</malay> the dengue case and then one of my colleague <malay>boleh kena</malay> dengue [seh] (uh) (uh) and the <malay>kelakar</malay> part <malay>dia mat salleh</malay>
so #ang moh# [lah] you know and then
<malay>dia dia asyik</malay> I think <malay>dia asyik keluar petang</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>ke apa entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia cakap abeh dia cakap</malay> [oh] I I was out sick for one week so I said [lah] how are you so I thought maybe (um) like he fever <malay>ke</malay> cause you know [lah] nowadays <malay>kalau sakit</malay> it's like either you <malay>kena</malay> COVID nineteen or you <malay>kena</malay>
dengue and then the funny part is <malay>dia cakap dia kena</malay> dengue
(uh) (uh) confirm and then <malay>dia dah takut</malay> because they <malay>dia ingatkan</malay> that <malay>kena masuk</malay> hospital [lah] so actually <malay>tak payah</malay> because I think you have to self isolate for seven days
ya but it's quite serious [lah] because I don't know
I I I don't know how he got it I think <malay>dia cakap</malay> that maybe because <malay>dia selalu keluar petang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia keluar petang</malay> to go jogging around <malay>dia punya</malay> area and <malay>dia</malay> standard [lah] <malay>dia tinggal dia tinggal kat</malay> robertson quay you know that near to the clarke quay boat quay area [ah] then after that
(err) don't know how he <malay>balik</malay> and then <malay>dia macam dia pening</malay> [lah] <malay>abeh dia batuk-batuk</malay> [lah] and then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia rasa macam</malay> something is wrong [lah] so <malay>dia cakap</malay> actually <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor first time then doctor say [oh] maybe you're just tired because <malay>dia sekarang</malay> [kan] everybody work from home [ah] then after that <malay>dia ingatkan</malay>
okay [lah] maybe I'm just tired I don't have enough sleep blah blah blah and then in the end <malay>dia pergi</malay> to another doctor the doctor <malay>cakap</malay> dengue then <malay>dia dah</malay> panic [lah]
so <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana ni macam mana</malay> [seh] so <malay>dia dia takut</malay> that <malay>dia kena</malay> hospitalize [lah] because <malay>kalau</malay> hospitalize most likely you can be in the ward if like let's say you get dengue maybe instead one week it becomes two weeks
[ah]
p[a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] and then nowadays you know [lah] <malay>kalau ambil</malay> is not like those days [lah] [ah] like <malay>dulu kalau tak nak pergi kerja pergi</malay> I mean <malay>ambil</malay> <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] one two days stay at home <malay>sekarang</malay> is like your name might be on the record you know and then your boss <malay>semua tahu habis</malay> [seh]
(mm) [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
is it <malay>tapi dia orang datang hari-hari tak</malay>
[orh]
<malay>abeh macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>dia orang nak</malay> check <malay>macam</malay> I mean you see the the mosquito is so small how they want to check like okay [lah] I know they can check for the eggs and all that but how can they check because
I saw like (err) <malay>kat apa tu</malay> at the west side I think #yishun# or what is one of the hot spot
and then like every other day <malay>ada</malay> fogging [ah]
and then fogging you know [lah] the smell [oh] my god and it's like everybody work from home it's like my friends who are staying in #yishun# and woodlands they say every other day <malay>ada</malay> fogging
and the whole house will smell of the fogging smell <malay>macam nak muntah</malay> [seh] and it's like I don't know don't know that's why I'm thinking like how can they see the mosquito can they see I don't know or maybe they got their own equipment is it
[oh]

by the time they want to <malay>gigit</malay> you they just <malay>gigit</malay>
most likely it is [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>leceh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang kalau kalau sakit</malay> then <malay>susah</malay> [tau] <malay>nak kena pergi</malay> doctor [lah] <malay>nak kena</malay> self self isolate [lah] then <malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam-macam</malay> test [seh] <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena ambil</malay> is like it's a good thing if you don't get sick nowadays but now this this I mean getting sick you know [lah] is hard to predict right ya so <malay>kalau dah</malay>
I don't know [lah] just keep healthy [lah] [ah] just keep on exercising <malay>makan betul-betul jangan makan</malay> all the
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat [lah] once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
he just drink water a lot everyday because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> medicine for dengue there's no cure just like COVID nineteen scary [ah]
(mm) correct correct
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] nowadays
every other day sure got some story [one]
in the news both (mm) (mm) local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting [sia] I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like [oh] my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
and it's like during a pandemic and then like you don't see the end you know like every other day <malay>mesti ada</malay> something you know and it's only what august [oh] my god
crazy (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
!huh! [oh] my god

(mm) (mm) fifty five
ya [lor] that's why how [seh] they check everyday like that <malay>tak penat ke macam</malay>
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya [lah] that's true [lah] (mm) (mm) it's a bit more controlled [lah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] that's why that's why the dengue also increase because I was just reading that construction work has stopped right and then you see [lah] the weather like <malay>panas</malay> [lah] <malay>hujan</malay> [lah] then all the <malay>air bertakung</malay> like that then <malay>mana tak</malay> dengue [seh] ya then there's nobody like
because my house area <malay>ada banyak</malay> new flats all the flats and all that so all the construction you can see like there's no more
construction going on like it's so quiet like all the new blocks <malay>macam seram</malay> [seh] like so quiet (mm) so I guess [lah] because of that also ya they never really check on the construction sites
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
more and more ya (mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> [lah] correct
[ah] [ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kesian</malay> [eh]

ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like (err) quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that [oh] my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know [lah] I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like

I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about (um) you know using this reserves for

(mm) (mm)
ya that's on transport food ya
correct like all the small small things [ah] like I think you spend less [lah] when you're working from home and like we're staying home more often you really just spend on like the essential items like groceries and like you know just the things that you really need I mean clothes also you want to buy <malay>nak pergi</malay> shopping <malay>nak beli apa</malay> [seh]
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah] correct

you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
(mm) (mm)
<malay>kelakar</malay> right it's really like three hundred and sixty degrees [eh] completely different like but the I guess now people just have to accept what is the new normal [lah] you know what I mean
<malay>kalau tidak susah macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay> like if people still keep thinking that things will go back to normal like think about travelling like travelling is like
something that I don't know like
every every singaporean loves you know (mm) (mm) like that day <malay>apa tu baru</malay> national day weekend like most of the time like thousands of flights will go and that day somebody uploaded online like I think only seven flights went off during that long national day weekend

like I feel like companies are really stepping out of their comfort zone to like provide virtual stuff for people in general you know so I think it's quite impressive like that day <malay>baru</malay> I was watching a play online like can you imagine like instead of going to the theatre you can actually watch it at home and the best part is it's for free interesting right
ya that's true (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] netflix [eh] netflix <malay>hari-hari</malay>

like you say [lah] they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore

(mm) (mm)
I think <malay>dah buka</malay> [lah] but like I mean you have to take precaution right
!wah!

ya [lah] sometimes no choice is the best choice [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) physical is no longer really needed [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
you know going out is still a bit of a like you know you just go out like you say [lah] just go out for awhile then <malay>balik cepat-cepat</malay> you know what I mean so ya video calling is the new
normal I guess you know
(mm) (mm) ya
neighborhood right ya correct correct even the fireworks [seh] [oh] my god that was so amazing like I didn't know that you cannot you I always thought that [oh] the fireworks you have to do at #padang# because that's the designated spot or like that's the legal legally allowed place but this year [oh] my god so many different places <malay>kat</malay> #tampines# <malay>ada kat</malay> #jurong# I think is it
[ah] !wow! amazing (mm) (mm)
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya [lah] (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) cancelled [kan] [oh] postpone [ah] okay okay
once every four years right (mm) (mm) millions of dollars also the amount of money imagine all the <malay>duit</malay>
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know [lah] I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
[oh] ya I think I saw that
(mm) (mm)
nature is healing [ah] mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) ya ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) less is more
(mm) (mm)
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving [what] you know
(mm) (mm)
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it [lah] you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell [lah] [oh] okay (mm) (mm) hobby [eh]
<malay>boleh nyanyi</malay> (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya that's true
ya [lah] must be positive [lah] because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
sure everyone around the world feels that way you know what I mean like you <malay>rasa</malay> like <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa marah</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa sedih</malay> [lah] you <malay>rasa ni</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam</malay>
<malay>macam-macam perasaan tapi</malay> at the end of the day <malay>mesti</malay> positive [lah] you know <malay>kalau tak</malay> positive <malay>susah</malay> [seh] I mean <malay>hari-hari takkan</malay> I mean the thing is that
cannot be everyday you are positive [lah] of course some days <malay>kalau nak sedih ke nak marah ke</malay> just feel all your emotions and then
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done [lah] of course but can be done it can be done ya
<malay>tak penat ke</malay> [eh] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay> no [lah] and also you complain
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> (mm) (mm)
true
standard [ah]
[ah] <malay>ni kalau ni</malay> singaporean <malay>kalau tak</malay> complain <malay>bukan</malay> singaporean [kan]
(mm) (mm)
I mean it's complaining is part of life [lah] you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
(mm) (mm) true very true
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul</malay> I mean there's good and bad [lah] I mean like you said like
you complain and I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely [kan] (uh) (uh)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya but also like I guess the other annoying thing or like the the recurring issue that is always being talked about is wearing of the mask [lah] right I mean ya I mean singapore <malay>nak semua orang kena pakai</malay> mask
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see [eh]
<malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask
so like <malay>macam suka-suka</malay> [jer] then I like
[eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] I thought this wearing of mask thing it should be like mandatory [lah] for all but then I guess
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like (mm)
<malay>jaga diri baik-baik</malay> [lah] you know <malay>kalau pakai nak pakai</malay> up to you [lah] you know
(mm) (mm)
<malay>semua nak jadi</malay> famous [ah] <malay>semua tak ada kerja nak jadi</malay> famous [ah] so okay [lah] so <malay>dia orang tak nak pakai</malay> mask then like I guess
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>bukannya mahal ke</malay> the mask <malay>ada</malay> I think what less than one dollar you can get already
(uh) <malay>tu</malay> [lah]

it was okay [lah] (um) they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that (err) they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there [jer] !siala! what is my five year plan
<malay>nak buat apa</malay> five year <malay>aku tak tahu aku cakap macam</malay> [oh] definitely I want to excel in my career meaning that I wanna be moving up the ladder not just in terms of management role [lah] but you know like also like <malay>macam</malay> okay if this is something that I have never done before so that to me is also a progression right or if let's say
(err) there's a position that opens up in a different department and (um) my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to [ah]
I was like <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>nak cakap</malay>
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay (mm) answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
<malay>kau jawab apa</malay>
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees [ah] sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like [oh]
I aspire to inspire <malay>kau nampak</malay> <malay>kau nampak</malay>
yes so [ah] I had like three interviews and then (um) so this is what for it's like so as in I got three interviews (err) no was it three I think I I had three interviews and two follow up post yes yes yes from the same company so (um) I felt that <malay>macam</malay> this company is [kan] and and
but it gives me a very nice (err)
I I wouldn't say informal it's it's formal enough to know (err) where you stand or what you want to get to know you as as as a candidate but at the same time it's not like stressful you you know how interview can be can become like <malay>macam</malay> like !siala! I want go interview but I scared [sia] yes like you know you get so intimidated by the interviewer
[oh] long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long [oh] they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can (err) I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like [oh] I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like [eh] so what you want do you for five years [ah] [ah] you know like you like you could say like !huh! five years [ah] !wah! I never really think about it [eh] and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also (err)
you also answer like [oh] never really think about it [eh] but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long [lah] but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer [lah] so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say [ah] [oh] [ah] I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee (um) so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve (um) more things
which is true I I think it's also like (um) I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that [oh] (err) in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K [oh] you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you [eh] I give you three point five [lah] you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic [what] so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also [what] right so I think you choose your job
we choose it in a in a sense where this pandemic is gonna be for quite some time so even if you find a replacement job you must you be able to like the job if not you gonna drag your feet to work you know and you also have to think strategically in a way where <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>aku kerja sini kalau aku tak suka aku nak nak berhenti kerja lain</malay> then <malay>bila aku cari kerja lain</malay> I'm fighting with a lot more competition then after that <malay>macam</malay>
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different (um) setting it's all about how you make it (um) you make it work in the in in this stuff [kan] [lah] fourteen december
very much so yes okay [lah] no look my training ground is actually quite far <malay>tapi aku aku fikir panjang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia cakap</malay> five year plan [kan] <malay>aku fikir</malay> five plan <malay>dia dekat dengan rumah aku saya pun</malay> okay
yes my new colleague tell me okay okay we will see you become like reach this position in five years I just no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] <malay>satu tahun</malay> then coming july <malay>dua tahun</malay>
<malay>cepat juga</malay> [kan] I feel like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! all the job demands <malay>macam</malay> I'm like just taking in everything so it's good that you when this new colleague <malay>masuk</malay> [kan] <malay>beberapa macam</malay>
<malay>berlega sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>hati aku tak payah banyak sangat buat macam</malay> everything is on me you know and some more yes but when he ask me like [oh] like you want to become a we have a senior position at my workplace in the next few years I'm not sure you know having the having my own local brand
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that (um)
I don't want to be too greedy [lah] like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale !wah! that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack [ah] but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
but I really wanted that #tengah# estate house get the the sales of balance flats if I get it the house will be ready in may twenty twenty two twenty twenty three because it was the first few launch yes the one that they released in november as in recently the house will only be ready in twenty twenty four or twenty twenty five <malay>jauh</malay> [seh]
because my fiance <malay>dia tak ada</malay> passion <malay>nak pergi sangat</malay> to get a house planning or let's say we'll see how
yes I know your work right (um) about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
(err)
not not like what's in it for you but more of <malay>macam</malay>
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
(uh) role in terms of career wise I'm like in redeem [kan] so I used to be in right and then now I'm in like mass production retail so people it's funny <malay>macam</malay> we see that aspect of people who like I don't want to buy [ah] you know I want to save money [ah] now now tough time [lah] cannot spend [lah]
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
and and we haven't had a lot of okay lately there have been a few chinese tourists tourists <malay>bukan bukan</malay> local <malay>aku takut</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [bah] certain certain countries can come in singapore already [what]
so <malay>macam</malay> like a the same thing [lah] okay yes I I hear the same thing you know like now cannot [lah] no cannot spend [lah] now (err) must save money you know market very bad financial very bad blah blah blah blah blah but your bill can go up to like what five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say [lah] hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like !wah! you say this kind of things [ah]
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and (err) we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household [lah] but you know on an average
(mm)
average family probably would have one [lah] fashion <malay>jenama</malay> big brand it's like that two iconic brand [lah] <malay>orang</malay> queue [lah] <malay>kat luar</malay> (uh) (uh) okay you know and chanel
<malay>orang</malay> people queue [lah] [sia] <malay>kat luar</malay> people queue people queue outside and these are some of the people who queues outside their store come up to my stores with paper bags of their stores and come to my store asking me [eh] got discount !walao! [eh] you buy [eh] you buy chanel then come to my store and then ask me for discount
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand !wow!
!wow!
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
yes but you can always cancel but you can always cancel your subscription <malay>apa</malay> in subscription
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up [lah] I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel [lah] but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account [eh] there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically (um)
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't (err) I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say [oh] it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website (err) can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account [eh] you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
[oh] yes okay okay okay <malay>boleh boleh boleh</malay> easy easy easy
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting (um) this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
(err) it's the security

the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks
the first when you start the first six days is one bottle a day then subsequently it's once every two to three days yes so it's kinda like a two month worth [lah] or three right
and then (um)
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes
even so everybody yes so you know when I enter the office right everybody was in uniform and in safety shoes
yes yes yes so (um) the job requirements it <malay>macam</malay> let's say (err) you you of course your duty is only in the office [lah] you know you know you don't have to go like you don't have to go out onto on on the floor but let's say if they need assistance on the floor then they will ask you to help [lah]
so that's why you have to wear safety shoes for safety reasons
monday to friday yes
yes duty area is different [ah]
but my for me it's office hours [ah] [oh] my god yes four years I mean okay [lah] I think is okay yes and then also like like
you know sometimes when you afternoon shift then you come in the afternoon then the bus and the train is not so not so
definitely
while I use my weekends but now I have my weekends and all the public holidays there are I don't care <malay>aku rasa betul tu</malay>
<malay>kena saya macam kentang</malay> (uh) [kan]
that is true
<malay>macam mana terisik aku macam kat situ</malay> [jer] this could be a big break right
of course [oh] my god <malay>tadi ramai gila</malay> because people got nowhere else to go <malay>kau nak pergi mana</malay> now there's no holidays right so usually families would go on holidays with the kids spend time but now people cannot travel anywhere [what]
then weekend where you want to go go out [lah] with your kid go to town don't want to shop also you shop see see look look
well food is life so what <malay>aku rasa</malay> challenge is right
because I work shifts I cannot be bothered to shop cause tired and also the job is quite demanding physically also you just like like like today [oh] my god <malay>penat gila</malay> bro
so sad I didn't even get to sit I know it was so tiring I literally like towards the end of the day I felt weak you know my throat dry <malay>macam</malay> flu

one cycle [lah] <malay>aku</malay> one pill ten days I don't like it the side effects are [oh] if I stop then but it's not wise to take pills
but it's it's not wise to take pills on a regular because then [eh] it's only functioning because it was induced not because it's happening naturally therapy yes actually
what supplement are you taking (mm)

[ah] so you <malay>macam tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia punya</malay> dangers and stuff
so next time when you [dah] <malay>dapat</malay> license your motorbike licence <malay>ke</malay> car license or lorry license so next time you know especially when you see [eh] got one cyclist coming or [eh] got one cyclists behind me you know [lah] to be more careful
[eh] wait wait that means you on which practical five [eh] <malay>lima</malay>
[ah] okay okay okay before [oh] ya prac five <malay>yang</malay> you have to do everything in the circuit then <malay>kalau</malay> pass prac six then only can go out at the road
(uh) okay <malay>tapi</malay> one thing about #ubi# [eh] cause I took my license there at #ubi# also
that <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] when I when I took my license <malay>apa tu</malay> #ubi# [ah] very crowded so you just be very careful [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> especially when you first time <malay>keluar naik</malay> road
there's a lot of lorries also so listen to what the instructors are telling you [lah] so ya
yes yes #ubi#
because I know some of my <malay>kawan</malay> they took the license motorbike licence <malay>kat</malay>
the one <malay>yang kat</malay> the one <malay>yang kat mana</malay> woodlands woodlands ya I know they told me that the area there <malay>sunyi</malay> [ah] quiet like not as many vehicles not as crowded <malay>macam kat</malay> #ubi# so I think for them was <malay>macam lagi senang</malay> to pass the test [lah] test

<malay>kalau</malay> you go out on the road I think one instructor the ratio one instructor is to five
six or five riders I think that that's <malay>lagi</malay> more <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] as you go along this
course
but when do you think you will get your license though <malay>boleh beli</malay> motorbike <malay>boleh naik</malay> motorbike no need to ride your bicycle
<malay>lagi</malay> that day <malay>yang kat</malay> [ah] news north west line the major [ah] blackout !alamak! <malay>itu dia orang</malay> during <malay>bila</malay> peak period and then the red line the green line <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> yellow line <malay>sekali</malay> breakdown
ya but [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> when you when you [dah] pass [eh] which I hope you do pass soon which motorbike you looking for yamaha suzuki
one five zero <malay>itu</malay> [kan] the tuning training centre <malay>punya</malay> motorbike [eh] <malay>tak</malay>
[oh] you can get cause I know my friends <malay>yang sekarang tengah pakai</malay> they say it's (err) fuel efficient <malay>dapat jimat duit sikit</malay>

<malay>tapi</malay> I would say that the transport has he has been getting better [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> I think a few years back three or four years back <malay>ada</malay> this one period of time macam</malay> every week confirm plus chop <malay>ada</malay> breakdown every week confirm <malay>ada</malay>
waiting time either too long [lah] or the
breakdown [lah] <malay>ada yang</malay>
(err) the
the travelling time was too long <malay>ada</malay> [jer] problem <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> but I would say now is much better [lah] they're doing a much better job but but having said that <malay>masih boleh</malay> improve that they can still improve so that's my take

then I <malay>duduk</malay> I <malay>tunggu tunggu tunggu</malay> for my friends nobody turn up <malay>tak ada orang datang</malay>
so I just wait and wait and wait and then the next thing I know <malay>ada</malay> because the place where I <malay>tengah duduk</malay> (uh) is facing the road
so I saw this one <malay>kereta</malay> just drive past <malay>tapi nampak ni kereta macam pernah nampak</malay> [jer] this <malay>kereta</malay> then I noticed <malay>dia punya</malay> driver was my one of my teammates so I was like okay okay maybe they already arrived so I'll just continue sitting down so
the driver and two of my other teammates came out
and then when they came and approach me they said that
[oh] by the way <malay>kita tak makan kat sini</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> them they <malay>tengok</malay> me and then I still remember other tables
of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
they went to put a blindfold around me and then I was like <malay>terkejut sikit</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>asal tiba-tiba</malay> want to blindfold me right so they blindfold me and then they they put me in the car
then (err) so they blindfolded me so when I <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>kereta</malay> I didn't know who is inside I don't know what was inside the car so you just tell me <malay>diam-diam</malay> and then just sit in the car they will drive me to a unknown location [lah] location <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>sendiri tak tahu</malay> so
but then I think the duration on the car trip was about twenty minutes I could hear like they went to make some pit stops because I can hear the the <malay>dia punya pintu</malay>
I can hear the <malay>pintu buka</malay> but when the <malay>pintu buka</malay> also I I cannot remove my blindfold okay then after that I
I felt like the car [dah] park and then my <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> say okay now you can (uh) get off the car so of course <malay>ada orang pimpin</malay> my <malay>tangan</malay> cause I already blindfolded I cannot just walk right I might fall into <malay>longkang</malay> or something
[ah] okay then I just <malay>ikut</malay> I just <malay>pimpin</malay> my friend <malay>tangan</malay> they brought me to a unknown location [ah] next thing I know when I open my blindfold I was at marina barrage heated gang marina barrage
<malay>kita kat</malay> marina barrage
ya [oh] if I remember correctly <malay>tak salah</malay> there were about
seven to eight more of my soccer teammates who were there and they they were sweet they <malay>letak</malay> (uh) picnic mat they <malay>letak</malay> (uh) fairy lights and they prepared some <malay>makanan</malay> like pizza which was good because I was hungry by then and
just to remind everyone that we were (err) <malay>tengah puasa</malay> time <malay>tengah puasa</malay> I was very hungry and then they prepared some food and drinks <malay>ada bawa</malay> (uh) game cards so that we could play and then we played some music and nice [lah] like people celebrate your twenty first birthday
<malay>yang paling</malay> best (uh) <malay>lepas kita dah makan dah</malay> sing song (uh) <malay>perut dah kenyang</malay> and then (err) one of them pass me a birthday present
and <malay>nasib</malay> is the birthday present that I have been wanting for quite some time it was a <malay>kasut</malay> nike like this specific <malay>kasut yang</malay>
was quite <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] actually so they managed to everybody chip in some money and then they bought this <malay>kasut</malay> that I think was about <malay>dua ratus lebih</malay> this pair of nike shoes
so (uh) of course I was even more happy [lah] that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that
ya no okay ya I was very happy when I got the present
and honestly when if I were to buy a present for somebody I will <malay>tanya</malay> the person first like [oh] <malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you want a teddy bear <malay>ke</malay> you want
you want if motorbike cannot [lah] I not that <malay>kaya</malay> so I cannot buy for you a motorbike but if you want a storybook or a backpack <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] if you your birthday present what do you want
ya at that point in time <malay>bila aku dalam kereta macam</malay> [eh]
<malay>takkan</malay> they want to kidnap me <malay>takkan</malay> they want to <malay>hantar</malay> me to #johor bahru# or put me in a abandoned house or something <malay>ada</malay> [lah] there was a period of time I was like <malay>asal kereta ni macam</malay> suddenly so quiet [eh] like where is everybody in the car or suddenly they abandoned the car then I'm sitting there alone in the car not knowing what's happening
so but I trusted them I mean they are my <malay>apa ke tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kawan-kawan kaki bola</malay> so that ended well and I think the thing about a presents [eh]
because sometimes I don't want to <malay>belikan orang tu</malay> a present that they might not want or <malay>atau</malay> present like they won't use so either I will ask them personally like [oh] okay what do you want for your birthday [lah] or it's either I buy for them (uh)
vouchers like it can be <malay>macam</malay> adidas voucher it can be capitaland mall vouchers can be nike vouchers [ah] <malay>pergilah kau apa kau nak beli</malay>
I know <malay>kalau kalau perempuan dia orang selalu cakap lagi senang pasal</malay> can buy (err) gift card from sephora especially like sephora or you can buy from victoria secrets usually [lah] girls I think <malay>lagi senang</malay> to to buy presents for compared to a guy
anything
but I know one thing at least [ah] my friends my kawan kaki bola yang</malay> celebrated my birthday with me [ah] they actually
took my suggestions I I wouldn't even call it suggestions actually I said that I <malay>tak suka kalau macam</malay>
(uh) big (uh) birthday bash <malay>macam ada orang</malay> [kan] they especially <malay>kalau</malay>
twenty one birthday they will have their <malay>macam nak</malay> glamour glamour have it at the chalet where they where they will invite <malay>macam kawan dia nenek dia</malay> cousin <malay>dia abeh nanti banyak sangat orang</malay> like I <malay>tak suka</malay> that kind of stuff [lah]
I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
<malay>kawan-kawan rapat</malay> [lah] so is good thing that they didn't throw a big (uh) big surprise at a chalet or hotel so I do you like <malay>kalau</malay> anybody do like a big grand gesture like that
that's why that's the thing
and also <malay>kalau macam banyak sangat orang</malay> especially <malay>kalau</malay> invite <malay>banyak sangat orang abeh orang yang</malay> you <malay>tak kenal atau orang yang</malay> that you barely talk to so you <malay>macam tak nak</malay> awkward [lah] then <malay>kalau banyak sangat orang</malay> also later you have to
you have to split your time with (err) different people and then I mean you cannot cut yourself into half right so you will have to speak with this group of people for like five ten minutes and then you <malay>kena</malay> go to entertain another group then you you'll be busy just entertain people actually
instead of having <malay>macam</malay> a very good time and <malay>macam</malay> #shiok# <malay>sendiri</malay>
and I so I feel like <malay>kalau</malay> like you want to have a this <malay>macam</malay> grand gestures right you need to <malay>kena fikir</malay> where you want to have your your birthday present where sorry where you want to have your birthday celebration until <malay>macam sakit kepala</malay> [lah] you have to think
about venue and then you have to book in advance <malay>kalau</malay> you want to do like
<malay>tempat mahal-mahal macam</malay> hotel you have to book maybe a few months in advance
maybe and aside from venue also you <malay>kena</malay> book
[ah] <malay>makanan</malay> I mean come on I mean when you invite people you don't want them to come there and then there's like nothing to eat anyway we're all singaporeans right so we we love our food so we need think about venue <malay>nak kena fikir pasal</malay> (uh) <malay>makanan</malay>
and then you have to send out invitation then you have to you if you want to have some entertainment then you have to <malay>fikir</malay> [oh] what entertainment do you want I mean <malay>kalau</malay> you have someone else who is doing the planning and stuff okay [lah] then you can like <malay>lepak</malay> don't have to
think about anything but then again
if you gonna <malay>dapat orang</malay> birthday planner or something like that then you <malay>kena bayar</malay> this birthday planner <malay>pakai duit lagi</malay>
[oh] ya I mean like quite true [eh] <malay>tadi</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal</malay> if your birthday on <malay>macam</malay> twenty fifth december <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>macam</malay> your birthday is on (err)
thirty first december where's the peak period <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> confirm <malay>nak nak</malay> book (err) <malay>tempat macam</malay> want to book the hotels <malay>dekat dekat dengan</malay> the floating platform so they can probably see like the fireworks and stuff
so that one will be even harder [lah] I would say or even if your birthday falls (uh) during national day parade I'm pretty sure it will be quite difficult quite difficult and <malay>susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> all this (uh) bookings and stuff
and also <malay>kalau macam</malay> some people <malay>macam tak nak</malay> celebrate <malay>dia punya</malay> birthday <malay>kat</malay> singapore <malay>nak pergi</malay> overseas <malay>ke apa nak pergi</malay> #batam#
or let's say somewhere even further like you want to go poland or something to go and celebrate your birthday <malay>itu lagi mahal kau nak kena beli apa tu</malay> plane tickets <malay>semua tapi sekarang bila</malay> time <malay>macam gini</malay>
nobody saw it coming <malay>macam</malay> time COVID you cannot go anywhere man you have to stay in singapore you have to celebrate your birthday in singapore but of course it will be more <malay>gerek</malay> [lah] if you can celebrate your birthday in #bali# or something watching the sunset or sunrise that one confirm more <malay>gerek</malay> [sia]
like I think for me <malay>kalau</malay> if I can choose [eh] where I want to spend my birthday I want to go where's that <malay>tempat banyak</malay> sheeps [ah] new zealand
like honestly if I can if I can choose a place to celebrate my birthday or to choose a <malay>tempat</malay> for me to go holiday that would definitely been using you can go to the countryside <malay>boleh apa tu</malay> feed the animals you can play with the animals I mean come on man in singapore
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any
(err) <malay>kambing</malay> so at least when you go places like new zealand especially <malay>dia punya</malay> countryside you get to see all this kind of animals and you get to do a lot of (uh)
natural activities like <malay>apa tu yang kat</malay> river the water rafting you can go hiking you can see
(uh) nice nice mountains and of course <malay>dia punya cuaca</malay> also <malay>lain lain</malay> from singapore singapore is always hot either hot or wet so at least there in new zealand if you can go during the winter times <malay>dapat juga</malay> some snow you <malay>pernah pergi</malay> new zealand [eh]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> (uh) japan japan <malay>nak cari</malay>
halal food also was quite difficult I remember that time when I went with my family we went to go japan or we wanted to look for halal food <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay> and
it was not readily available so you have to do your <malay>macam</malay> homework [lah] before you go you must probably want to bookmark the places where you want to <malay>makan</malay> halal food
because it's not like singapore where your halal food <malay>boleh dapat</malay> at food court you can <malay>dapat</malay> your halal food at a hawker centres which are all <malay>semua dekat dekat boleh jalan</malay> so there the
their are halal food [ah] is different different locations and you have to go and find it in <malay>orang jepun</malay> they don't really speak english so <malay>kalau nak berbual</malay> you probably have to use [ah] the app google translate to help you out
to find your places that you want to go [lah]
[oh] the place I went <malay>mana</malay> [eh] I went to their
(uh) #tokyo# so #tokyo# was #tokyo# honestly <malay>dia macam</malay> singapore [lah] <malay>macam banyak sangat orang</malay> it's very crowded it's a very urbanized so if there's other parts of <malay>jepun</malay> that I would like to visit (err) I will go further up north
(err) <malay>pergi</malay> #hokkaido# I think #hokkaido# also <malay>lagi tempat dia</malay> will be more <malay>sejuk</malay> and I think the food will be even nicer as well
have to been to <malay>pernah pergi tak</malay> #hokkaido#
so I think <malay>kalau</malay> if you don't want to go <malay>jepun</malay> another place that I <malay>pernah pergi</malay> also (err) south korea like at least south korea you know [lah] people there <malay>dia punya</malay> complexion <malay>semua cantik-cantik</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> the people there their are complexion all <malay>putih-putih</malay> and then I think probably I know why now because when I went there their food
is always some kind of (err) herbal food <malay>dia punya makanan</malay> is very different from singapore like our singapore diet <malay>kita banyak lemak-lemak kita banyak pakai</malay> (err) <malay>makanan yang</malay> very oily but there in korea their food
a lot of steam food a lot of soup a lot of herbs
and they always like to eat their favorite #kimchi# so I think their diet really helps them out to for them to look even more <malay>kacak</malay> and <malay>cantik</malay> [lah] actually
[oh] ya because their their location have (err) what you call that four seasons but for us in singapore it's just hot all year round because we are located <malay>dekat</malay> equator
so I mean I'm pretty sure (uh) countries <malay>yang ada</malay> four seasons of course their complexion would be even better I mean if you go to [ah] further up north
places <malay>macam</malay> (err) sweden <malay>ke</malay> or you go to norway or finland if you <malay>tengok</malay> their completion <malay>putih macam letak bedak</malay> kind of putih
so of course I wish I had that kind of a complexion but it's okay no problem
and (err) one thing <malay>kalau</malay> want to talk about (uh) going on vacation and stuff I think one (err) important aspect about going to vacation is to <malay>naik kapal terbang</malay> like honestly I miss
I miss taking all this <malay>kapal terbang</malay> just to <malay>duduk</malay> inside the plane and then below you look out the window you can see the clouds you among the clouds and that
that feeling of like you are sitting
in a roller coaster when the plane [dah] <malay>nak</malay> takeoff <malay>atau</malay> the plane about to land I think that's why now COVID (err) introduce the
dining in the parked aeroplane like <malay>macam banyak orang nak pergi tapi dia punya</malay> pricing I would say to me is a bit expensive like you are eating
I think the cheapest one for the economy class is two hundred two hundred dollar plus just to be eating in a parked plane and sitting in the <malay>tempat</malay> economy
so maybe I will decide <malay>nak tengok nak pergi ke tak</malay> but probably not maybe you just want to sit the aeroplane and that's probably the closest thing [lah] that you can get to travelling during this
(err) COVID situation will you go for this (err) parked (err) <malay>makan</malay>
and also I think the the tickets for the business class and first class if I'm not wrong [lah] is about six hundred plus if I'm not wrong and honestly <malay>kalau nak fikir pasal</malay> six hundred plus I think that six hundred plus I can use
for better purposes six hundred plus I can use it for a staycation <malay>kat</malay> #sentosa# <malay>ke</malay> or I can use that money for
staycation at resorts world #sentosa#
I can use that for better purpose as an anyway since we are coming to december <malay>dah nak dekat</malay>
I would wait for the hundred dollars tourism voucher [lah] to use it and spend and help to revive the economy because I mean since <malay>orang kat luar</malay> cannot come in so obviously we are the ones who have to
do the spending and we are the ones who will have to
(err) help to revive our very own
economy so I hope that so I hope that I hope that (uh) we will we will be able to come out of this (uh) COVID nineteen strong and hopefully we will
go back to being normal arab we will all still stay happy and positive
okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye

(mm)
(mm)
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
[kan]
ya ya ya the also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
ya they volunteer because I'm I'm one of the (uh) volunteers right so <malay>aku</malay> my my my volunteering with them is really fostering [ah] so I'm a rather than you know (uh)
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
(err) and then
it's a shelter the dogs are in [kan] [kan] is a shelter it's over at west we're actually quite close to what <malay>tengah</malay> ya <malay>tengah</malay> ya we are very close it's it's just next to #choa chu kang# ya like we're very close to so they have people they have volunteers at the shelter itself so that means the volunteers must go to the shelter (uh) that involves dog walking
(err) cleaning really literally like cleaning the you know the poo poo ya ya and then (uh) there are volunteers such as ambassadors such as what I mean like <malay>macam</malay> they have events they have events like okay then there is an event here at this (uh) (uh) at this (uh) area at one raffles place so they have like a booth or two booths you know and then they need somebody to to to to to man the merchandise table and another one is to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam orang lalu-lalang</malay> [kan] then you <malay>macam</malay> talk about the awareness <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] which I wouldn't mind doing actually (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> (uh) we don't get enough as a volunteer I don't get the notifications anymore because I think they stopped that [lah] for being like you said [lah] because of the COVID ya so they're not so you know they can't go out in the open anymore for now
dog walker <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> only you and the dogs <malay>tapi macam</malay> public all this awareness sort of stuff (uh) no not so much now I think later they will probably do it I used to get (uh) emails <malay>pasal</malay> unit unit ambassadors and all that <malay>tapi</malay> now no more
ambassadors <malay>macam</malay> you you you <malay>macam</malay> you at the booth and you wear <malay>punya</malay> t-shirt (uh) you're next to the merchandise <malay>punya</malay> table sell the merchandise and then of course the donations <malay>punya</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) tin <malay>tu</malay> [kan] and then then you talk to people about okay this is what we do (uh) this is what we do as an and these are the cases <malay>macam gitu</malay> awareness of (uh) what does and how they can help [oh] they also have social (uh) pre-corporate social responsibility <malay>punya</malay> programs companies <malay>punya tu</malay>
so then you can do that (uh) they can say [oh] we need we need volunteers for to do the ambassador part and all that ya so of course they have different volunteer <malay>ada</malay> volunteer <malay>macam</malay> photography
<malay>macam</malay> to be a volunteer photographer to take pictures of their animals for their adoption drive for their website ya you know all the <malay>gambar-gambar</malay> for the calendars so regular they need (uh) you know volunteers photography web design web designer of course fosterers a lot [lah] I'm one of them
<malay>anjing kucing</malay>
which I'm fostering for <malay>kucing</malay> I volunteer to be a foster for critical care
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
fosterer for puppies <malay>macam gitu</malay> so when they have cases then they contact you say okay #wati# we have this then
ya no [lah] fosterer no
what
ya (uh) yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic [ah] they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say [oh] the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say [eh] your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay [lor]
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the (uh) but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
exactly <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
you know [lah] [kan] international [kan] [kan] <malay>nama</malay> international <malay>punya</malay> brand [kan] so <malay>orang pun ada</malay> [lah] you know <malay>macam kasih</malay> donation <malay>gitu ada</malay> [lah] I think I guess they do have you know (uh)
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
(uh) but at the end of the day they still run on donations only which is quite sad (uh) <malay>kita punya</malay> G O V <malay>takde kasih apa-apa</malay>
government
[ah] G O V
<malay>dia orang</malay> [eh] <malay>ini binatang-binatang kita orang</malay> [tau] <malay>daripada negeri ini mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga sikit</malay>
[ah] that is the <malay>masalahnya tu</malay>
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish [lah] cannot be
[oh] I think must there has to be some (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> caretaking of all or all inhabitants but of course we're certainly the portion is not [lah] <malay>macam</malay> of course the priority is to be citizens in a way as in proportionate you know but
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way [lah] you know [ah] in fact I was just talking about it to (uh) to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing [kan]
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
areas not all these wooded areas you know these these areas #bukit batok# [lah] <malay>banyak banyak macam</malay> jungle jungle <malay>apa</malay> they are clearing all the forests and the stray dogs are coming out you don't know #bukit batok# has a lot of stray dogs ya and they are the stray dogs are coming out from the jungle areas and where are they going to go they are being pushed out right from other developments where are they going to go then they are going into the (uh) estates like now so then of course who is going to get panicky residents residents are going to complain (uh) authorities come in take the dogs and cull them which is very inhumane so ideally what you should happen is if you are going to develop the land which I know you probably should have to but then there has to be contingency plan where you going to drive the animals out <malay></malay> you know is like I feel it is not thought through out you know okay we're going to develop the land we're going to end up pushing the animals that are in there they are going to end up going to hello resident areas so why don't we do something about that two pronged approach
so and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean [kan] it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish [lah] what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
<malay>tengah</malay> (mm) (mm) (mm)
no they don't both okay
of course they know they know they see it we they see it all the time and dogs are coming out #punggol# #pasir ris# #choa chu kang# but there also but also yes the wild boar of course is in the news and everything how can they not know but are they doing anything no they are not the second part is the second part is they are not this is why we are frustrated we go like why don't you do something help we are not telling you to do it one hundred percent because we are completely we understand that they are completely incompetent but <malay>takde</malay> collaboration <malay>kau faham tak takde</malay> supportive effort at all <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>kita sekarang kita punya</malay> and animal welfare groups okay why don't we support you into doing this you know what I mean <malay>kita nak buat macam gitu macam</malay> okay <malay>kita dia orang</malay> because <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang boleh ambil</malay> I mean they are the ones with the expertise the heart the passion all that but they cannot be run they they cannot do all because they have no space and <malay>duit takde duit</malay> [kan] so <malay>siapa yang ada duit ni yang itu</malay> [kan] government [kan] so at least <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kita tolong</malay> collaborate [lah] you know (uh) okay (uh) <malay>kita buat ni</malay> then you all can (uh) <malay>kita boleh kasih kau orang</malay> support <malay>sikit-sikit untuk</malay> blah blah blah you know this is exactly what should happen but it's not happening so <malay>apa yang buat sekarang</malay> is <malay>bila binatang ni keluar yang</malay> #gahmen# #gahmen# <malay>ni semua angkat tangkap bunuh</malay> it's like it's an inhumane approach you know what I mean ya <malay>itu yang kita</malay> boring
I mean this this this look at
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> not to this extent not to this extent look at #tengah# now #tengah# <malay>baru</malay> #tengah# is now being developed which means they are they are accelerating and intensifying the development so now the animals are getting pushed out last time the animals are not getting pushed out so much because #tengah# is still around correct #lim chu kang# <malay>sekarang semua nak</malay> development #punggol# <malay>mana ada</malay> #punggol# <malay>dulu dulu mana ada</malay> waterway #punggol# <malay>sekarang dah ada</malay> #punggol# <malay>apa</malay> all the dogs from #punggol# are coming out you can you can literally walk on #punggol# street with the traffic light and there's like a pack of stray dogs <malay>dulu mana ada</malay> because #punggol# was not developed that's why the the problem is highlighting is being highlighted now because !wah! dogs are coming out what how come people people are like how come there are so many dogs because they have been around but just that they have been developing they are getting pushed out they have the dogs have been around in there in the jungles people I know people who go around and feed the dogs at the edges of the forest because the dogs are coming out you know you they know why these people go to feed them at the edges is because they are trying to prevent the dogs from coming into estates because it will be that will spell danger for the dogs you know the dogs people are going to complain people are going to complain the the dogs are going to be in danger so but the dogs are hungry so people now the feeders go to the edges to feed them and the dogs are you know they are wild dogs they're feral dogs but they are very smart and they very and they really harmless because all they want is food they're not interested to go down to the to your heartlands and do what whatever you know they just want food so the people the feeders there go to the edges feed them then they go back inside the the jungles they are very sweet you know but
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
the wild boar <malay>pun sama</malay>
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in #pasir ris# why because #pasir ris# you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no #pasir ris# farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to #tengah# now they are all in #tengah# now the animal welfare groups so they are developing #pasir ris# that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible (uh) to all residents who are going to panic
<malay>betul</malay> exactly <malay>aku nak salahkan</malay> wild boar <malay>tu macam mana kesian pula</malay> so this is exactly what we are <malay>ini macam</malay> frustration [lah] [kan]
<malay>gatal</malay>
no <malay>gatal kau tengok aku punya ni</malay> rashes <malay>tapi aku memang</malay> sensitive skin
<malay>kau</malay> <malay>kulit kulit buaya</malay>
<malay>kau takde macam ni</malay> cover <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>ni</malay> [kan]
[ah]
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
<malay>abeh ada tulis</malay> arab [ah]
[oh] !wow!
[ah]
<malay>ni tak tak sangat</malay>
[oh] they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is (um) is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again (uh) so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute [kan]
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya !aww!
is it [oh] so sweet
ya
!aww! bless her !aww! ya
<malay>kena saman</malay> there's no such thing
I don't know about the <malay>saman</malay> part I know you that you <malay>kena saman</malay> if you litter
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
we tell people don't put up food water because the dengue and then particularly doesn't like that because dengue <malay>apa</malay>
national environmental agency they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment [lah]
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case happens to walk past then you #kena# fine [lah] or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
(uh) okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home [kan]
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear [lah] some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
you know they because they have they have a certain route right okay block this block I feed three cats eat eat eat feed feed feed feed <malay>makan makan makan</malay> [ah] <malay>dah habis</malay> okay bye bye clear
and then I go to the next block some people do that or some feeders they will just from one block X they walk to they leave the food then they go to block Y Z then they <malay>balik</malay> then <malay>patah balik dia orang patah balik</malay> then clear [lah]
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
<malay>kalau tidak</malay> it is considered littering
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough [lah] you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering [lah] I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
<malay>entah</malay> littering [lah] whatever the charge is whatever the sum is hundred dollars I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering [lah]
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it (uh) we we tell people to be responsible feeders
they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no [lah] maybe not here [lah] but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
town councils town councils (um) cat welfare society ya ya usually cat welfare society collaborate with town council and they put a sign [lah] <malay>dekat kat</malay> lift landing you know (uh) please keep clear within two hours <malay>macam gitu macam</malay> posters
which is good [lah] to remind people you know kind of like that [kan]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah]
block <malay>mana</malay> this block this block
[ah]
<malay>kasih makan</malay>
[oh] my goodness
they are copy cats
ya [lah] that's called district cats [lah] they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
(mm)
ya
[ah]
[ah] ya
[eh]
(mm)
because so much traffic [eh]
<malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> back to <malay>macam</malay> back to nature [eh]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
scout does I thought <malay>dia bawa kawan dia</malay>
(mm) ya
<malay>ni depan ni</malay> [eh]
but it's quite safe [what] this this tree
traffic
(uh) ya
[ah]
okay
ya
[ah]
ya
<malay>kesian</malay> [eh]
back to their refuge [lah]
away from all the <malay>orang-orang</malay>
ya [eh] <malay>masa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> what <malay>bila aku dekat</malay> (uh) botanic gardens <malay>aku kerja kat situ</malay> [oh] my god the otters came all the time and they were huge my god they are like
[oh] they have a certain route all my colleagues will go off first at ten o'clock they will be here and then after that you can find them <malay>dia orang macam ada</malay> very designated they like know where to go first first then second twelve o'clock you will see them there is like
people who work there know where these fellas go (uh) their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way [oh] then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
(uh) so funny and it's true right they would go almost every (uh) almost everyday
(uh) I guess because botanic gardens [kan] <malay>ada</malay> lakes [kan] <malay>ada</malay> lakes <malay>ada</malay> eco lake swan lake and all the <malay>macam</malay> the stream stream stream and you know botanic gardens
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where [ah] the drains [ah] does it go to I don't know (uh) so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but (uh) it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
the the the park rangers make sure that the animals don't get disturbed you know so (uh) when there are otters we tell people me when I was located you know like me when I was located no please please stay aside you know make sure ya we basically monitored people's behaviours so (uh) the the we were policing the people for the otters the otters I guess felt safe <malay>macam ada</malay> bodyguard
(uh) so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules (uh) I guess you know the the otter felt safe [lah]
ya <malay>dah macam</malay> they were protected ya which is a nice thing you know and but it's so nice to see them they were so cute huge though [oh] my god the biggest one I swear I swear it was like that I was like when I saw I was like my god it's huge ya they're very big
<malay>mana ada longkang</malay>
[oh]
you know there are a few families [ah] apparently
because singapore there are a few a few families of otters they're not no they're few families <malay>dia macam</malay> different clans
otter
are you cray cray are you kidding me they are different ya there are different families <malay>macam</malay> different hello <malay>macam macam</malay> tigers [kan] lions [kan] <malay>ada</malay> different pride
<malay>sini ada</malay> so they have the #kallang# clan the #kallang# one which is like the the family that lives ya !alah! <malay>kau baca</malay> [lah] <malay>dalam surat khabar</malay> you know the otter city the otter the otters are being watched by their fan club
there is a fan club [ah]
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
ya they are <malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] they <malay>macam</malay> the hobbies <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] yes they are watching the birds the [ah] okay yes <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so they have the okay only the otter fan club [lah]
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know [oh] this is the #kallang# clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
<malay>mana</malay> ya !alah! of course [lah] they look the same <malay>mana</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tahu macam mana rupa dia orang</malay> but they are these these people are the experts right they they like okay that belongs to the #kallang# clan
(uh) so the #kallang# clan otters are the ones that hang out in the #kallang# area <malay>dia macam</malay> territorial [lah]
this is their territory [oh] then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not #kallang# so that is the one so they have different families [lah] all clans
maybe another clan !huh!
maybe they are another clan but then again you know <malay>yang dekat yang dekat</malay> #kallang# <malay>tu</malay> !wah! I tell you
(uh) or the ones <malay>yang pergi</malay> <malay>kau tak baca dia masuk kat</malay>
[ah] <malay>gitu dengan</malay> <malay>tu</malay> that one is one clan know
[ah] [ah] so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
ya [eh] <malay>dekat</malay> #bishan# park #bishan# park <malay>pun ada</malay> [tau]
I don't think they look for other clans
(um) when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say #kallang# clan is like is like this is their territory
you know <malay>macam</malay> they have a certain it's just like cats and dogs and lions and all that this is their roaming this is their range
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks [ah] this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
(uh) this is their territory <malay>kau masuk dalam</malay> territory <malay>dia orang boleh bergaduh</malay>
I guess among themselves [lah] I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
<malay>dia orang bukan macam</malay> (um) some canines some felines <malay>yang</malay> after a while they have to separate you know so I don't think so that's why you call it a family great technique family
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook !aiyo! so sad [ah] I think that was one was near (uh)
(uh) one of the (um)
I think (uh) <malay>tempat</malay> fishing <malay>punya</malay> people who are not allowed to fish but they still fish there
I think #kallang# I think one of the anglers one of them the babies got stuck the hook <malay>mati</malay> [tau] so sad
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news [lah] okay so what I remember in the news
they <malay>macam</malay> they go to their <malay>mana aku tahu dia orang pergi mana</malay> but they have their own spare trait [lah] <malay>kalau kau macam pergi dekat</malay> #kallang# river side I'm sure there is you can see them I told you botanic gardens they do botanic gardens
(um)
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove (um) they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far (um) the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts [lah]
one of their hangouts you know [ah]
ya ya ya
!wah! the otters right
cute right
ya (uh)
[eh] cute
to be honest <malay>aku tak ingat sejak bila</malay> when is the first time they came out but otters <malay>ni tapi</malay> (uh)
(uh) both <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) I don't know I don't know I don't remember when <malay>aku nak kencing</malay> I don't remember exactly when I don't remember exactly <malay>apa apasal aku</malay> toilet what do you mean I come back [lah]
ya <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] but I don't remember exactly when the otters (um)
(uh) I don't remember exactly when the otters you know <malay>keluar</malay> but definitely at least (uh) you know five years I think
<malay>bila bila aku</malay> start <malay>perasan ni</malay> [lah] when I first started you know noticed the news [ah] not noticed the orchards okay noticed the news
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
<malay>masa kampung</malay> babe <malay>masa kampung-kampung dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada sungai-sungai</malay> otters <malay>nak pergi</malay> <malay>nak buat apa sekarang</malay> they're all where are they going to go
ya
<malay>sama</malay> [lah] <malay>sama</malay> [lah]
these people these okay these animals are native so when they started ya ya they are native they are you know also they're from we have mangrove <malay>apa dekat</malay> #sungei buloh# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] so I guess they decided to <malay>jalan keluar jauh sikit</malay> [lor]
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing I don't think so no (uh) unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like (uh) in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say [oh] this the the the #kallang# clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like !wow! bloody hell how do they know I guess they know [lah] they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
not care taking not care taking no no ya ya ya ya ya ya they are not it's not care taking but they care for them in the sense that they care for their welfare they will do (uh) they will do (um) <malay>macam</malay> awareness <malay>macam</malay> don't feed the otters do not go near them don't
you know if you see them stay away don't don't provoke don't <malay>apa apa</malay> you know so they do that sort of message they carry that sort of message but of course depending on the context [lah] these are otters so you know so when they say we say they care for them means they will like they know [oh] they come out at this time so they know their habits they know how many of them
you know they might even have names I don't know ya so there's this group (uh) this you know quite a sizable number of their fan club that actually know them that knows them well well enough to know that this one belongs to this and there are like seven adults and two babies [meh] ya you know from a distance I guess they record which is <malay>kau tahu macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> the ornithologist <malay>yang tengok-tengok</malay> observe the birds and they will also all these these clans but they don't necessarily take care of them right in that sense
you know not the caretaking type [lah] but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the #ulars# maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay [lah] let's put it this way [lah] shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction [tau]
you know the otters in the city !wow! can you imagine you are at bloody then otters that's like !wow! what a nice sight of course of course ya ya ya but you know ya because they are like <malay>macam</malay> unlikely sight
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no [lah] they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
[ah] then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
ya <malay>mana</malay> ya pythons ya pythons and then they ate the cats and all that ya there's one there's one recently (uh) couple of two months ago maybe one snake over at <malay>entah</malay> #bukit merah# or what the snake ate the cat the com cat
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
ya all these com cats <malay>kat bawah</malay> it's the natural predator <malay>apa</malay> natural hello this is a cats snake hungry ya so they ate been a few cases where the cats ate the snakes is it com cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release [lah]
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again
less and less what forest yes yes exactly so we are driving them out so the snakes are eating the com cats already quite a few com cats already <malay>mati</malay> because of these the snake <malay>pernah ada satu ada satu gambar ada satu gambar yang</malay> snake <malay>tu yang</malay> snake <malay>tu tengah</malay> com cat <malay>dekat depan dekat mak</malay> news [ah] snake com cat [ah]

okay so ya <malay>dia</malay> nuts he was carrying the table and then after that the the slot just doesn't go in <malay>mengamuk</malay> [ah] then I don't understand it's like julie was trying to tell him to just carry the thing out just carry the table out like which I said then he was like no no no no cannot carry because the thing is not locked I was like <malay>sudah</malay> [lah] just <malay>angkat</malay> [jer] [lah] he wants to have the table locked <malay>jadi dia punya tu</malay> a catch under the table I know right that's a assault ya <malay>allah lepas tu bising-bising</malay> I don't get it <malay>tapi si</malay> julie <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>angkat</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>kau</malay> then <malay>kita tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh</malay> like lock lock

(err) most of the
(err) most of the incidents takes (err) take place in [ah]
hostel <malay>punya</malay> the hostel environment [ah]

(err) some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge [ah]
I'm not too sure about this [lah] I can't confirm but
there are some right where
(err)
I think this [one] also depends on the price of your accommodation [ah]
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
I really really needed to take to take a piss <malay>nak cepat-cepat kencing</malay> and it really cannot <malay>tahan punya</malay>
so
(err)
we wanted to use the complex <malay>punya</malay> toilet right but there was so many people
and then a lot of people were still there so <malay>macam</malay> we like
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
bro bro bro bro bro <malay>aku nak pakai</malay> toilet bro bro bro then he was a malay guy he was like okay okay okay <malay>kau tunggu kejap kau tunggu kejap</malay> so he actually
so the guy actually (err) took I still remember you (err) he had the
<malay>kunci</malay> he had the key inside (err) he had the key on the rubber band [ah] then he like
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered [ah] so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
(err)

a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby

ya that what I was thinking
[eh]
[a'ah] <malay>dah habis haus sangat tapi macam nak kencing sekarang</malay> [eh]
just over there
(mm)
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
[ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay>
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also [lah]
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I guess it's the same feeling as like taking a play but you can see everything I <malay>apa</malay> [ah] just like I cannot
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
[ah] how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
[ah] about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time [oh] !wow! yet
amazing [ah]
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
<malay>itu</malay> front stab
want to stab yes
[oh] please [ah]

like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
(mm)
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this

ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be

<malay>habis</malay>
did you <malay>jumpa abah tadi</malay>
[oh]
<malay>sama-sama</malay>
suddenly
thank <malay>sama-sama</malay>
(mm)
it's one for one
<malay>jadi</malay> (um) the price total was (err) forty dollars forty five
yup
(mmhmm) no got a lot
don't know

(mmhmm)
[lah] cannot <malay>tak boleh</malay> think ahead <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>berapa lama ini</malay>
!huh!
<malay>dalam dunia</malay>
[oh] I know
[ah]
[oh] <malay>saya tahu</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
<malay>sebab saya
<malay>sebab saya makan terlalu banyak</malay>
then
it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than <malay>duit</malay> then (err)
ya I will <malay>boleh jimat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
(mmhmm)
clothes <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kadangkala</malay> [jer] <malay>boleh</malay> splurge
but
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so you're not open minded [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
for me it's (err) <malay>mengada-ngada</malay>
like some
no
ya like some girls
or people that that do not respect (err) like
(err) ya other people like example <malay>macam</malay> service crews <malay>cikgu</malay>
that [one] <malay>itu tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah]
especially during class
<malay>kalau dia orang betul-betul</malay> like
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like boundaries like as <malay>sebagai</malay>

yup
I think
no
I feel like with the absence of (err)
like <malay>semua benda</malay> like the system capitalism <malay>semua sudah tak ada</malay>
then you will bring about chaos [lah] <malay>sebab semua orang akan</malay> like <malay>fikir</malay>
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example <malay>macam</malay> food <malay>semua</malay> food resources
water resources everyone will fight to get as much as they can cause there is no
boundaries you know what I mean
<malay>tak ada</malay> system ya
so some would <malay>tamak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> will definitely
<malay>dia orang</malay> will definitely be selfish [lah] of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually <malay>macam</malay> create havoc
so as much as capitalism <malay>semua orang cakap macam tak bagus</malay> it's like much needed in the
much needed in the society unless there's another way in which (uh) we could
(err) prevent like chaos from happening [lah]

cause we're going to meet again tomorrow
afternoon
ya like one
ya
on sunday

and my name is #haziqah#
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay [ah] (um) just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today [ah]
ya so two more days before friday !woohoo! and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
[oh] so you go back to school all the way
!wow! we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
[ah] the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
<malay>adalah kaedah</malay> get in the workers are you get everyday
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
<malay>kuih suji</malay> is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
[oh] I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause [ah] number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but [eh] actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having [eh] a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's (uh) I don't think that it is (uh) economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like [oh] hello good morning like greet them and then (um) scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so (um) ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause (uh) it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like <malay>berat</malay> it's just so heavy and
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like [oh] my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues [ah] they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
[eh] I don't know [eh] I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
<malay>ada aku kisah</malay>
!wow!
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like [eh] well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example [lor] then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like !aww! you got a forty seven [oh] I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on (um) students (uh) to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
(um) and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to (um)
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics [lah] so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like [eh] you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like [oh] english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue [oh] and like
[oh] and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like [oh] like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like [eh] you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
(um) only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena [eh] novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than (err) poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into [ah] mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching (um) teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where [eh] you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly [what] that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like (um) india or
at any
any colonised (um) sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce (mmhmm) scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that [lah] that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
(uh) I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this (um) having that divide you know (uh) haiti versus the dominican republic
#puerto rican#
!wow!
ya [lor] so
[oh] also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in #jakarta# per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their [ah] ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world [leh] even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are (um) there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around (um) say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them [what] at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
<malay>malas nak layan</malay>
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
like really <malay>tak kisah</malay> like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that [lah] even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like [oh] it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like [oh] say like in primary school you don't have like [oh] you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
you the <malay>minah</malay> that's very <malay>bising</malay>
<malay>mulut besar</malay>
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
why would I wash my <malay>selimut</malay>
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then (uh)
I'm tired
stop yawning
!wow! okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
#kaypoh# boy #kaypoh#
(mm)
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue !duh! is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds [ah] cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with #gingy# though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
(mm)
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
[oh] speaking of that right (uh) there's this tweet saying that (uh) what [ah]
(uh) the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just (uh) what do you call it [ah]
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
[eh] doesn't make sense [oh] is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like (um) south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

so how you today #nas#
[oh] ya
ya ya ya I I also been watching Netflix [lah]
[oh] favourite [eh]
(um) there's a lot of #animes# I like to watch I I'm a anime fan [lah] so Netflix surprisingly <malay>dorang macam makin banyak</malay> anime <malay>dorang masuk-masukkan</malay> [kan] I was like !wah! quite quite amazed though <malay>sebab dulu</malay> Netflix there's not much anime
[oh] right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no [lah]
you still hype <malay>dia masih ada</malay> serious serious because right now (um) the movie just came out <malay>abeh macam</malay>
all all of us (uh) <malay>kita pergi tengok</malay> movie <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
there are some of our friends also <malay>dorang masih belum tengok</malay>
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
and also <malay>tak salah aku</malay> the season two <malay>pun belum keluar kalau kau belum</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau baru nak</malay> start the hype you still [ah] don't have to wait so long for the season two
but
but don't I don't know I I feel like you should wait for season two come out <malay>sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu</malay> season two possibly <malay>dorang akan keluar</malay> like
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
ya Netflix it came out [ah] slow but it came out came out right april <malay>tak salah</malay> april twenty twenty that's when the hype <malay>betul-betul naik</malay> [ah] [sia] and <malay>apa</malay> everytime
like (uh) there's some <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that [ah] the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also (err) <malay>dia nya</malay> #manga# because normally #mangas# like <malay>macam</malay> for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach (uh) #naruto#
<malay>dorang punya</malay> like the amount of copies that they [kan]
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>tak salah aku</malay> one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay [lah] this is just a rough gauge all of them [ah] took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
<malay>untuk</malay> demon slayer for the #manga# <malay>aje</malay> [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> !wah! it's only four years [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> hundred and twenty million <malay>dah</malay>
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
with drums [ah] [ah] <malay>tapi pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] japanese [kan] <malay>kita melayu kita kita kompang</malay>
<malay>masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya</malay> [eh] <malay>asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
ya the like what they say [ah] <malay>apa</malay> actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how <malay>apa</malay> #gui# is [ah] as a person
but but
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia nya</malay> other than the anime
(um) <malay>apa</malay> soundtrack <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
because one thing about (uh) anything in general [ah] <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a show or something [kan]
it is more emotional <malay>kalau dia nya</malay> soundtrack is a very <malay>macam</malay> it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer <malay>sekarang</malay> the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa <malay>yang</malay> the opening
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of certain events in their life
and <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
that it becomes like everyday object everyday [ah] actions are <malay>sampai</malay> they don't know [ah] they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but !wah! it's
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
for all the #animes# [ah] I watch <malay>semua ikut yang</malay> this <malay>dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang</malay>
<malay>macam aku rasa</malay> like one shot there's this thing called one shot #animes# <malay>dorang</malay> usually <malay>macam</malay> forty plus minutes <malay>abeh dah tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia macam</malay> a short a short film [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> but it the sometimes like
<malay>orang fikir</malay> like [oh] the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters [ah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> even like those thirty or ten minute films [kan] it leaves a very
(uh) everlasting mark in your in your memory <malay>macam tak boleh lupakan</malay> it's that good [ah] like the story storytelling even (uh) the soundtrack cause come on man [ah] without soundtrack anything will be boring [lah]
exactly cause that's why I I always [ah]
I always envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
it's okay man it's okay <malay>aku nya</malay> A math <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bila entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> there's this kind of stigma [ah] whenever you go to school or like university [ah] in that case
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
so whenever you go to university you have that certain feeling that <malay>macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh</malay>
[ah] I I shared this with my one of my friends [ah] <malay>dia pun tengah ambil</malay> university but I think is like I think ya so ya [ah] bro that [one] is just that's just one person [lah] don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
especially <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> coding <malay>atau</malay> math [kan] there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where <malay>macam</malay> [oh] wait what's going on I don't understand [sia] and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly <malay>atau atau</malay> secondary school [tau]
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like (mm) I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
(mm)
ya
<malay>sebab mak aku</malay> english teacher
(uh) ya ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
ya and also <malay>macam</malay> being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called (err) from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is !huh!
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood [lah] in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
<malay>macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ni</malay> like <malay>asal asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kecil hati</malay> exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like [eh] don't don't be so abrupt don't be so <malay>macam</malay> rude [ah] <malay>kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini</malay> [kan] the person who speak all those abrupt words or <malay>macam kasar</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] normal [lah] <malay>takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe]</malay> so I'll just continue with what I'm doing [ah]
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and and in okay [ah] in university especially
adapting and also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what's that word again (uh) you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my my school also cause (err) if I'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
<malay>abeh kalau</malay> your
<malay>dah macam</malay>
lesser than two point eight
then <malay>kau akan dapat</malay> suspension
suspension meaning
<malay>satu tahun kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau</malay> [ah] [eh] sorry
after one year then <malay>kau kena</malay> re-enroll
ya
(um) when you are in a academic warning <malay>punya ni</malay> [ah] ya
if you haven't get academic warning then <malay>asalkan</malay> your is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save [lah]
[ah] ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay I
<malay>ada</malay> is that <malay>macam kau nya</malay> topic <malay>bukan</malay> topic <malay>apa</malay> module module is that module <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kau nak kena belajar pasal</malay> another language
like <malay>macam</malay> malay <malay>atau</malay> mandarin
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh] is it the same as <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau nak berbual melayu</malay>
<malay>ada benda kita nak kena</malay> reverse the structure of a of a word
!huh!
[oh]
ya
<malay>macam nak cakap</malay>

but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
<malay>pejabat</malay> post
[oh] like <malay>apa</malay> dialects [ah] slang slang
(mm)
[oh] I
[ah]
(mm)
(um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>baru-baru punya</malay> module <malay>yang apa nak nak kena ajar</malay> like <malay>aku rasa</malay> for example like
(uh) in the market I guess one thing <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam banyak-banyak tukar</malay> is the job finding
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say (err) user experience [kan]
normally <malay>macam tak banyak kerja pasal</malay> user experience [mah] because it's not that known to be (uh) to be like a proper job <malay>orang fikir macam</malay> !alah! <malay>ni orang lain buat boleh buat</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> it's another job
on top of the job that <malay>orang tengah buat</malay> but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object <malay>macam kau pegang cawan</malay>
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right <malay>abeh kau imagine kalau</malay> they handle <malay>ada duri</malay> <malay>tak</malay> comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics (err) the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though <malay>macam</malay> it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
<malay>macam kau tengah</malay> bad mood <malay>abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa</malay>
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
like (err) happiness like for example <malay>kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja</malay>
<malay>dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] how am I gonna get to that level so <malay>kau kau</malay> (uh) <malay>bertungkus-lumus kau</malay> (uh) <malay>cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak</malay> and that process <malay>buat kau</malay> bad mood
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
some people <malay>dorang dah</malay> so into earning money
that their greed is imposed onto them to make more money <malay>walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih</malay>
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset <malay>macam</malay> [oh] since I have this much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
I I'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but I guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can [ah] achieve
like <malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] like he said in two years [eh]
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was (err) I okay [lah] when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely all the
<malay>cam rezeki akan di diberikan</malay> like don't focus always on the <malay>rezeki</malay> focus on like
what make things work in in the last time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> retrospect [ah] but for now it's more like
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
which is why I appreciate like all those people <malay>yang</malay> even though it's just [ah] comic books or like anime [kan] it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya you have to take a break [ah]
that's why I feel
[ah] for this anime <malay>macam</malay> all these [one]
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
that's why like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] ya <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience [lah] the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
which is why I also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more large scale which is Marvel
!wow!
Marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
it's happening in in that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] alternate universe [lah] in a way [ah] ya Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is <malay>dorang</malay> they <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam</malay> the movie <malay>walaupun</malay> that movie <malay>ada banyak orang macam</malay> superpower [kan] <malay>tapi dorang buatkan</malay> character <malay>tu macam</malay> he goes through everyday life as per normal but (uh) they somehow <malay>macam</malay> in a turn of events they stumble upon something which made them into a superhero of some sort even though <malay>ada orang dorang tak ada</malay> [ah] superpower <malay>tapi</malay> a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something <malay>yang buatkan kau macam</malay> strongly
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
(uh huh) game of thrones [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
tell you about it like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam orang gemuk</malay> like they want to achieve being slim like have that [ah] that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like [eh] <malay>dah kurus</malay> [eh] [sia] <malay>baik [pe]</malay> but actually <malay>kau kau tak tahu</malay> like the process itself <malay>buatkan kau nak</malay> slim <malay>kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau dah kurus</malay> [kan]
you'll feel good [lah]
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal (uh) weight your optimal image <malay>tapi</malay> the
the thought of people <malay>macam dorang perasan</malay> like <malay>kau tengah berubah</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> you looking more slim or looking more [ah] toned your body looks so toned then <malay>kau</malay> you'll feel better and it helps to
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
<malay>tapi</malay> it's it's I guess this little happiness <malay>macam kalau nak</malay> go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness <malay>buat kau macam</malay> maintain your course cause <malay>ada orang</malay> let's say <malay>pasal yang</malay> language [one] <malay>aku pun tengah</malay> another language is called C sharp programming language
so that [one] (err) I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
for this different generations like <malay>sejak</malay> okay [ah] this past few hundred years [ah] there has been certain developments in (uh) certain parts of (uh) humanity like last time there's (uh) agriculture industrial evolution [kan] then there's (uh)
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some knowledge so I thought okay [lah] maybe
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if <malay>aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam</malay>
<malay>aku nak</malay> keep up to date to certain things <malay>jadi macam</malay> I'm not
(uh) losing in the race for finding jobs <malay>atau</malay> (uh) skill sets so
<malay>aku</malay> push myself [ah] I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes <malay>kalau kau buat benda sorang</malay> like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of there are more people that are saying like [ah] if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too introvert that they they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya ya
especially if you okay [lah] probably <malay>yang buatkan kau malu</malay> is <malay>kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku</malay> assume that <malay>walaupun susah</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> I can just Google <malay>apa</malay> Google is there for me to help <malay>boleh</malay> search <malay>senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri</malay>
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
(uh) the the amid the Google search <malay>yang kau buat</malay>
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work <malay>kalau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau ikut</malay> [jer] it will definitely not work
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience <malay>macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam</malay> five <malay>dorang main ke</malay> I mean
for educational purpose
ya like okay <malay>kalau aku</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> aim for
<malay>apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar</malay> like <malay>tiga tahun empat tahun</malay> [ah] not not not not <malay>tak tahu belajar</malay> I mean <malay>tak tahu tak tahu buat</malay> math like <malay>aku bagi dorang</malay> game <malay>pasal</malay> math <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nya macam</malay> quizzes <malay>aku bagi</malay> chemistry
<malay>lari</malay> [kan] that's why (err) that target audience is the most important thing when <malay>kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam untuk kau</malay> [eh] best [sia] game <malay>ni ada</malay> chemistry <malay>tapi kau tak tahu</malay> actually your audience is <malay>yang orang yang nak belajar pasal</malay> math
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
like iron man okay <malay>ni ni ni betul-betul</malay> (uh) off track
[ah] ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart [lah] like he might be one of the inspiration where <malay>aku</malay> will continue programming because
in in a way like the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
scenario <malay>kalau orang betul-betul</malay> don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so <malay>aku rasa</malay> like programming is a
it's a good it's a
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth [sia]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
I mean they will have a controlled environment <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia nya apa tu</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam</malay> this sphere <malay>abeh kalau ada ikut macam</malay> earth <malay>punya udara</malay> inside that sphere <malay>aku rasa</malay> everything should be fine <malay>kalau orang kena tanam ke apa</malay> there might be a proper grave for them <malay>cuma</malay>
it's weird [lah] it it's weird [ah] cause <malay>tak pernah dengar orang</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>mana kubur kau bukan kau</malay> [ah] <malay>mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa</malay> [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> mars [ah] <malay>aku nak merawat</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> spaceship but that is a possible future also like <malay>kalau</malay> let's say when elon musk <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) human will be planetary existence in in the universe so imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you have your own spaceship <malay>macam kereta sekarang</malay> but <malay>kau nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [ah] moon <malay>jap kau nak makan</malay> [ah] moon burger [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita gi makan sekarang</malay> K <malay>jap aku ambil</malay> spaceship <malay>aku</malay>
ya <malay>abeh kau</malay> [ah] fly [ah] okay [ah] <malay>ni</malay> set [ah] to moon then <malay>dia nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau cakap</malay> okay (uh) ten minutes ride okay
<malay>abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang</malay> Grab [pe] so <malay>kau</malay> call (uh) space Grab
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
unless <malay>bila</malay> mars <malay>dah ada</malay> a way to like
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya
maybe the thought of that like <malay>macam aku tahu aku tak mati</malay> so <malay>buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua</malay> you become complacent
then <malay>kau</malay> complacent then then there's no progress in life [lah] <malay>macam semua dah</malay> convenient <malay>untuk kau [pe]</malay> or <malay>aku boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku boleh tengok</malay> anime <malay>hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati</malay> [pe] so <malay>takyah belajar</malay> [ah] <malay>takyah belajar apa takyah mandi</malay> cause whatever it is even even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
I will still stay young [what] I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
makes humanity not to deserve to have a (um) <malay>apa</malay> eternal life
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
but not the things like <malay>macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni bagus</malay> [sia] okay <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> for example <malay>kalau</malay> michael jackson
<malay>dia buat buat lagu semua macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia tak mati</malay> it's still there [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] a legend it has it is a legend because
(err) people who die I don't know [ah] this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
so imagine if like [ah] the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] wrestling or any any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
the same goes for <malay>ni</malay> [ah] the the the football legend
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya ya
it's like it heightens your
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ada buat aku susah</malay> but
[ah] I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he (uh) that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film [eh] or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
[ah]
exactly
which is why I like anime
ya so okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> time [ah] <malay>ni tak banyak</malay> time sorry
stop [lah] am I at taiwan taiwan at times already [ah] okay [lah] hello [ah] actually [ah] K bye

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>
ya
be a good children
then
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
(uh) then we find it
(err)
<malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa</malay> canteen <malay>itu murah</malay> [lah]
ya
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
<malay>tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng</malay>
(uh)
<malay>ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kita kena kurangkan minyak</malay>
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi masalah dia</malay>
we cannot
no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang yang nak</malay>
<malay>bagi kita itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau saya ambil alih</malay>
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
<malay>macam mana nak masak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>boleh masak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto# #mee rebus#
#nasi lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] <malay>macam nasi putih nasi</malay>
<malay>lauk-lauk</malay>
so
(err) <malay>jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>baru saya boleh buka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sebab</malay> because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so <malay>kita kena jual benda yang sama</malay>
ya
so (uh)
<malay>orang yang nak jual itu</malay>
canteen they they <malay>cakap</malay> they <malay>ada</malay>
business <malay>lain</malay> so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ</malay> [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya (mm)
because
I
<malay>saya tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa itu kalau tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada kesihatan itu</malay>
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
<malay>duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) <malay>maksud saya yang</malay> my first wish <malay>yang anak-anak jadi baik itu</malay>
<malay>bukan baik</malay> I mean it's <malay>baik</malay> overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what I I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
meal
meal
[oh]
meal
(mm) my memorable meal
well
actually I cannot recall there were many
I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had
no because I think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this (um) same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
(err) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay>
(mmhmm)
smoked duck
<malay>dekat mana</malay>
(uh)
was it good
(mm) but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
(err)
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then I'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya (err) but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that
ya but
with these variations I I I'm a bit like <malay>macam</malay> old fashioned [lah]
ya
(mm)
<malay>tapi saya pernah ingat dulu</malay>
<malay>masa saya pergi</malay> india <malay>dulu</malay>
(err) <malay>ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik</malay>
he likes to go for hunting he has a
like <malay>macam senapang</malay> [tau]
I don't know what it call the long one
sniper I think so yes
(err) I'm not very sure how it works
(err) <malay>tapi dia pergi macam</malay>
<malay>padang</malay>
(err)
you know paddy field

(mm)

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so (um) <malay>sofian nak</malay>
if if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
your you know like <malay>macam</malay>
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
<malay>ada</malay> pilates

it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
ya like I said <malay>dulu punya</malay> coach <malay>itu</malay>

no
but I like bread toast [lah]
I don't mind
but (err) only the downside is that
(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just I like [lah] but not (mm) not I eat something that I eat rest of my life <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay>
(um)
I would rather go for something with proteins
like <malay>macam</malay>

(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you <malay>boleh</malay> you <malay>boleh letak rempah-rempah dia</malay> like <malay>kayu manis buah pelaga</malay> is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
<malay>bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak</malay> [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
<malay>kayu manis</malay>
<malay>buah pelaga satu cukup</malay>
then <malay>cengkih</malay> is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
<malay>macam daun salam</malay> is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you <malay>letak garam</malay>
(err) according to your taste [lah]
<malay>garam</malay> then when it when the
water starts to boil you <malay>letak itu beras</malay>
then you cook [lah] rice cooker

(err) <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you are talking about <malay>nasi minyak</malay> right
(uh) <malay>nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>ada letak</malay>
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like <malay>susu cair</malay>
half <malay>susu cair</malay> half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no <malay>nasi lemak kita letak santan</malay>
this is <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
ya <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you <malay>boleh letak daun pandan daun serai</malay>
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>boleh letak</malay> tomato
(uh)
you (uh) <malay>boleh letak</malay> chilli <malay>hijau semua</malay> [lah] then you put half half [lah] <malay>separuh</malay>
<malay>separuh susu cair</malay>
<malay>jadi tiga suku tiga suku</malay>
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) <malay>garam</malay>
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be <malay>macam kenduri punya nasi lemak</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like <malay>macam ayam masak merah rendang semua</malay>
ya <malay>ini nasi minyak</malay> simple <malay>punya</malay> so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken

<malay>banyak</malay> commitment
okay [ah] <malay>jom kita tengok</malay>
<malay>soalan</malay>
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
(hmm) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pada</malay> I <malay>semua makanan sedap</malay> so <malay>semua</malay> memorable
(um) <malay>kalau satu</malay> [eh]
[oh]
sometimes I still think about the #bunny chow#
right
ya I know like legit
<malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay>
<malay>terduduk</malay> right or like if I <malay>makan</malay> curry cause I <malay>tak suka sangat</malay> [tau] <malay>makan</malay> curry right so <malay>kalau makan</malay> curry right then confirm sometimes I will think about the #bunny chow# [ah] <malay>macam mengidam</malay>
so ya we had the #bunny chow# in
south africa cape town
and it is just
basically curry <malay>dalam roti satu bantal roti sebantal roti</malay>
and then curry <malay>kat dalam</malay>
and that was great
why was it great [ah] I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
[oh]
(mm)
poof
ya I know I cause like <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>kita nampak gambar tu</malay> that's why <malay>kita</malay> order [kan]
ya
so <malay>tapi macam</malay> I think <malay>yang kenapa</malay> like
is memorable right I think it's like the
<malay>tempat</malay> the <malay>tempat</malay> itself
like <malay>orang-orang dia semua macam</malay>
chill right like <malay>dorang nampak kita macam kawan baik padahal tak pernah jumpa</malay> and then I think cause also not a lot of people cause it wasn't a meal time
ya and the area we were at was like
<malay>tempat orang</malay> tourist [kan]
<malay>terus tak ada orang</malay> then <malay>kita</malay> [jer]
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[oh] ya the customer ya
(err) I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
food adventure day so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita makan tu lepas tu kita gi makan</malay> was it a burger
I try to remember
ya
cause also we had no money but <malay>kita nak makan banyak</malay>
ya <malay>nak kena agak-agak</malay>
<malay>agak-agak</malay> [lah]
the burger right
[oh] <malay>aku ingat</malay> [seh] <malay>aku ingat</malay> McDonald's
perbezaan dia memang</malay>
<malay>apa makna tu</malay>
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
I remember the McDonald's <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>aku saja</malay> [jer] <malay>keluarkan</malay> chili packet (um)
cause we were given only [ah] ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
<malay>pada</malay>
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I <malay>ada gambar</malay> I think
it was basically
<malay>satu benda tu macam</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dalam dia daging</malay>
right
it's like #roti# #prata# <malay>dalam gulung gulung daging</malay>
<malay>kari daging</malay> or something like that is it
ya we ate #samosa#
[oh] <malay>ada nasi</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> #nasi briyani# <malay>tapi tu tengah tengah dia</malay> cheese [eh] <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[kan]
cheese <malay>dengan daging</malay> [ah]
[kan] something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
[ah] <malay>tu nasi</malay>
<malay>daging dengan</malay> cheese <malay>ke</malay> something [lah] <malay>putih</malay> there right it was a
it was the thing
ya
ya then cause <malay>melayu dorang bukan macam melayu kita</malay> [ah] cause their malay is mainly they came from indonesia ya and then
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food [lah]
(mmhmm)
[oh] I <malay>aku tahu</malay> (err) there's something else <malay>kita cuba</malay> (um) <malay>apa benda tu yang roti</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [jer] [eh] <malay>roti yang</malay> is also from the malay <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>melayu</malay> the cake malay site no remember we went driving like I think on my birthday or something we went driving in that area
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like #nata# got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like #nata# look at there but I was driving
so that no it wasn't #bo-kaap# it was like a different side of cape town and then we drove there specifically for that particular <malay>roti</malay>
what was the <malay>roti</malay> called
okay so the <malay>roti</malay> is like [ah] <malay>roti perancis panjang gitu</malay> [kan] and then after that <malay>dia potong setengah lepas tu dia taruk macam</malay> you <malay>nak taruk daging ke nak taruk ayam</malay>
no it's not is it a #pani#
ya but it's like a very very long <malay>roti perancis</malay> right
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was (um) meat there was what cheese
<malay>sayur</malay> right and vegetable
ya then we no we then okay so we had the whole <malay>roti perancis</malay> and then they asked us whether you want the full you know like Subway like foot long or half right and then we were like ya we want full and then so he was okay so you want two
of the full and then we were like ya one one (uh) beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
[a'ah]
[ah] <malay>terus kita nak masuk</malay> [kan] ice box <malay>pun tak berani</malay>
not
[a'ah]
ya
<malay>tu lepas tu tak ada</malay> microwave
so <malay>kita macam</malay>
<malay>nak buat apa ni</malay> [eh] so I remember <malay>satu satu malam kita tinggalkan kat tepi kat atas meja betul tak</malay>
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner [tau] we ate lunch and dinner we ate that [one]
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
(uh) it was like I think we ate like like for lunch and dinner on that day we ate only half of that <malay>roti perancis betul tak</malay>
and then the next then the next <malay>roti perancis</malay>
the next day for breakfast
[kan]
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
front that <malay>roti</malay> we even half it again right so it was like one quarter so we ate the one quarter then the one quarter and another one quarter so it's like four four four meals ya but I think
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
no it's ya <malay>sedap</malay>
like (mm)
then the other day I <malay>tengok</malay> then there's I think someone was also at
cape town and they also [oh] it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like [oh] my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
the freaking <malay>roti perancis</malay>
to be fair they tried to warn us
(err) speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
(um) was we wanted to go to the hill remember <malay>kita</malay> there was like
<malay>hari kedua</malay> [kan] <malay>kita dah sampai</malay> okay so we <malay>sampai kat</malay> cape town then we already checked in and everything then the next day
so <malay>kita</malay> [lah] <malay>macam ghairah</malay> [kan] <malay>konon banyak tenaga</malay> so <malay>kita orang macam</malay> okay the next day ya
<malay>masih muda</malay> that was how many three years ago only
so like the next day we were like okay even though we're jet-lagged <malay>kita nak pergi</malay> we know <malay>tak nak buang masa kita nak terus</malay> like jump into all the activities right
so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
[ah] we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
and then the Grab driver was like very nice very friendly talk to us the entire trip okay this was at five or six in the morning can you imagine like we <malay>lepas</malay> just after we got off and then
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
ya and then the Grab driver okay so the plan was <malay>kita nak panjat itu</malay> hill and then after that at the top of the hill then we see the sunrise
right it makes so much sense and people say like to go up the hill it takes like you know half an hour at most so <malay>kita macam</malay> okay [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] settle <malay>juga</malay> [ah] [kan] so the then the Grab driver very nice what was his name [ah] I remember it was something very #doug#
<malay>betul</malay> it's like no #doug# or something #doug# [lah] his name I don't know and then and then ya I remember we made a lot of jokes after that no okay anyway so
so the so we told him that we wanted to climb <malay>nak tengok</malay> sunrise all that and he then he dropped us off at this spot and he said ya a lot of people <malay>panjat kat situ</malay> they start <malay>kat situ</malay> then they <malay>panjat</malay> and then by the time <malay>dorang kat atas nampak</malay> sunrise so <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] it doesn't look like
(um) the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the it's just the entrance of a
the hill or whatever and there's like signs that say climbing blah blah blah so <malay>kita</malay> okay [lah] go [jer] so so <malay>kita tak tak pakai benda</malay> climbing <malay>pun kita pakai</malay> jeans [kan] <malay>kita pakai</malay> winter coat (uh) you I remember you were having like the bomber jacket and then we started climbing
<malay>langsung</malay>
<malay>tak bersedia langsung</malay> we just started and then <malay>air pun tak ada</malay> I remember
<malay>botol air kita ada satu</malay> [jer] <malay>botol air</malay> right between us there's <malay>satu botol air</malay>
<malay>kasut biasa</malay> and then <malay>kita ada makanan kita ada aku tahu aku ada bawa gula-gula</malay>
you know Daim [kan] <malay>yang</malay> chocolate <malay>gula-gula</malay> something like that
I think there's like <malay>berapa gula-gula</malay> [jer] and then after that ya <malay>satu botol air</malay> okay so we started climbing then <malay>masih boleh sempat</malay> vlog [tau] <malay>mana</malay> video <malay>tu pun aku tak tahu pergi</malay>
then <malay>kita panjat</malay>
<malay>kita panjat terus dah macam lima belas minit ke dua puluh minit macam masih belum naik</malay> [eh] <malay>belum lagi sampai</malay> [a'ah] so <malay>kita macam kenapa kenapa macam jauh betul ni ingatkan</malay> like all the online say like it's very fast should be okay and then like okay [ah]
[ah] <malay>puncak dia macam jauh</malay> [kan]
I don't know [lah] <malay>kita dah sampai</malay>
go [jer] [ah] <malay>ikut</malay> [jer] <malay>takkan nak</malay> stop
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>tak jauh</malay> [ah]
[ah]
<malay>terus dah dah setengah jam gitu aku ingat kita dua macam dah penat</malay> [kan] <malay>terus ada kat ada macam tempat duduk</malay> [kan] then <malay>ada</malay> bench
then it was like facing the <malay>apa</malay> the town below so <malay>kita macam</malay> !wah! <malay>cantik kita pun duduk</malay> then <malay>kita duduk</malay> then <malay>kita macam penat terus minum air</malay> [ah] then <malay>kita minum air</malay> !wah! <malay>macam</malay> relax [ah] <malay>konon terus minum air</malay>
then by that time also sunrise <malay>pun dah naik terus</malay> [kan] <malay>kita macam</malay> okay don't need see sunrise [ah] but never mind [ah]
ya and then I remember <malay>kita</malay> share <malay>gula-gula</malay>
<malay>apa ni minum air lepas tu dah</malay> okay <malay>dah nak</malay> can continue okay <malay>jom</malay> continue <malay>lagi</malay>
continue <malay>berapa jam</malay> [ah] <malay>dua jam tiga jam dua jam</malay>
<malay>aku rasa dua jam</malay> continue all the way to the top
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as #bukit timah# hill
ya and
it was quite high like
[ah] in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like [eh]
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
<malay>ya allah bodohnya</malay>
like seriously <malay>siapa panjat</malay> all the way <malay>tak perasan macam</malay> [oh] go [jer]
<malay>permandangan</malay>
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
like <malay>macam jap jap dah sampai atas gunung</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> like <malay>waktu kita tengah panjat pun macam angin dia terlalu kuat</malay> [kan] then the <malay>angin</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>macam angin dia tengah tolak kita naik</malay> so I think that's why <malay>kita macam</malay> every time <malay>kita</malay> pass by that part <malay>kita macam cepat-cepat naik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> go go go go
ya
<malay>angin tiup</malay>
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
ya so turns out the hill was like so why the mountain was called lion's head is cause the lion the mountain the the the head it was actually the <malay>kepala</malay> and then there's signal hill that we wanted to originally to climb was actually the body of this lion
so <malay>kita</malay>
so we entered the wrong entrance [lah] basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
but the Grab driver didn't see that <malay>kita tak pakai baju</malay> athletic at all [oh] okay <malay>kita pakai baju lepak nak mampus</malay>
and I also think
[oh] I remember after when we were going down [kan] <malay>aleh-aleh ada ramai orang naik betul tak</malay> so <malay>dorang semua tengok kita orang macam kenapa dorang pakai baju macam gini</malay>
hiking stick
<malay>dengan beg sekolah dengan</malay> coat <malay>warna biru aku ingat</malay> [seh] coat <malay>aku biru macam</malay> shiny
your bomber jacket like bright pink bright blue so <malay>macam</malay> I really going down the mountain like wearing casual clothes and then these mountain people
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak puas</malay> [kan]
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
[ah] that that's the plan [ah] that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we all <malay>melayu</malay> together
we we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
!hais!
you told her
you talk all the <malay>masjid-masjid</malay>
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
all the <malay>masjid</malay>
[eh] but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city [lah] cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
<malay>kita ikut macam ada</malay> walking tour [kan] <malay>tapi tu kita tak</malay> halfway <malay>kita macam</malay>
we we bail out
[ah] what else
<malay>kira</malay> was cape town itself and then when we went for that safari after the school
okay how about we start with food
the safari so we had so basically <malay>lepas kita dah</malay>
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
ya it felt so long right ya like <malay>hari-hari ada benda nak buat</malay>
weekend <malay>kita orang pergi mana</malay>
<malay>pergi entah</malay> [lah] <malay>sekolah bawa gi jalan-jalan kat mana</malay> it's like literally weekend trip to a different part of
(um) south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
[ah] the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
it was it was very bulgy I think also cause majority of the <malay>budak-budak yang ada</malay> were <malay>budak apa</malay> american so like I think they had to up like they wanted to make sure these americans <malay>tak</malay> complain <malay>sangat</malay> confirm <malay>dorang</malay> complain ya
ya so for that after <malay>kita dah belajar</malay> for the summer programme then we had like this one week plus of safari so <malay>kita orang pergi</malay> (um) basically we went up the coast of southern south africa
and then <malay>kita</malay> ya basically went and look at all
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
we saw we saw them but like <malay>kat</malay> reserve like we had to enter a reserve to look at all the wild animals and it's not like a zoo where you know where they are cause you is if you're lucky then you get to see if you're not lucky then you don't get to see
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
[oh] ya I think cause we were at the coast
[ah] yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[oh] there was more than three right four I think <malay>empat</malay>
<malay>sepuluh kot</malay> and then <malay>macam aku tahu</malay> we had to sign up right for the vans and then we had to put our names down for which vans you want to be in
you know cause these americans
just just saying
ya and
#ish#
they not mature yet
ya so like
so we sign up we sign up for like the last van cause <malay>tak ada orang</malay> like no americans wrote their names there I think right so we put names for the last van
ya a few and other from right with a few other singaporeans and then
the
ya
ya same <malay>tanah air</malay>
<malay>terus</malay>
(um) ya and then like all the americans already had their cliques and whatever so they <malay>dorang taruk nama dorang</malay> in the first few vans or whatever you know supposedly it's gonna be like a fun trip for them
!woohoo! that kind of thing but then we went in like [meh] we just make new friends I guess in this new
van
and then (err) at the end of the whole thing we realised <malay>yang apa ni orang yang dalam van kita semua macam lebih</malay> mature I would say [eh] and like our van was like the most diverse diverse group of people and we knew we don't really know each other [lah] <malay>sebelum tu</malay> when we started the trip
but then by the end of the trip like the vans like the first like the the van <malay>yang</malay> first first <malay>tu semua macam</malay>
<malay>nanti dorang tak jadi kawan lagi ke apa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at first <malay>dorang</malay> start off <malay>macam ghairah nak mampus macam</malay> !woo! !woo! !woo! <malay>tapi tu</malay> at the end of the
like the whole week <malay>dorang macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> enemies [eh] <malay>macam tak nak dorang gaduh banyak tak cakap apa-apa padahal untuk</malay> van <malay>kita</malay>
beginning <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak kesah</malay> all then at the end of the whole thing <malay>kita orang macam</malay> !woo! !woo! !woo!
[a'ah]
avoid
ya and not only that we sacrifice one another like sacrifice ourselves
to
ya
<malay>berapa</malay> one week plus
ya ya
<malay>tak</malay>
I think he enjoy it [lah]
ya I mean got to be fair
he is a bit questionable but whatever
yes
with him never mind don't need
we had fun
I remember when <malay>kita dah balik</malay> he still message me for photo
ya he's like natasha where's my photos
I'm like ya like okay <malay>hantar hantar hantar hantar</malay>
ya the food wasn't much to say but ya the people
so what what did we do <malay>kita buat</malay> [oh] we did bungee jumping
kayaking in the river right
ya I that [one] I don't think I will forget cause I had to partner with the guy
and then everybody didn't want to paddle next to our boat so everybody just went ahead of us
[oh] <malay>dia tolak</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>aku tahu</malay>
yes
yes I remember
I remember scolding him
okay what else did we do kayak
the reserve
[oh] my god
the cave
I was just talking about this to my friend [tau]
ya I was like <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] I think #kaysa# [eh] anyway I was just telling her like
you know the other day like it's one of the few things that I will remember for life getting stuck in a cave
!hais!
I mean to be fair I warn everybody I was like telling them I feel like I will confirm get stuck cause I have no eye-hand coordination
let alone with my legs I no coordination whatsoever so I will I think I will get stuck in the hole
everybody laugh it off
and then what happened
I got stuck in the freaking hole
I couldn't see where my legs were I couldn't see where I was going so of course I just <malay>raba raba</malay>
ya and then at then during dinner I still remember someone like do you that someone was stuck in a cave and then I was over there ya that was me
then she automatically [oh] really I'm so sorry
[ah] okay (hmm)
a cave
(mm)
the highlight reel
you know hunger games then got the cannon boom
[eh]
so instead instead of the <malay>muka-muka kawan</malay> it's basically
do you want to see another prompt
do you want to talk about the food <malay>atau makanan atau</malay> everyday activity
(err) if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>aku baru nak tanya</malay> what's stopping you
ya I mean
it's still considered art
sure
okay
one skill
no the question was three but never mind I don't <malay>tengok</malay> we take turns [ah]
(um)
one new skill
(hmm)
[ah] I know I want to learn how to ice skate
for no reason whatsoever but just to have fun
I mean <malay>dulu aku pernah</malay>
primary school <malay>pernah belajar apa</malay> inline skating so I'm assuming that it will be similar to ice skating
I asked
ice
I feel like I <malay>pernah tanya</malay> #kaysa#
cause #kaysa# does ice skating
apparently her whole family does
ya you know <malay>hari tu dorang saja-saja satu keluarga pergi pergi apa ni kat</malay> #kallang# <malay>punya</malay> [eh] ice skating <malay>sama-sama</malay> and then <malay>dorang</malay> complain <malay>budak-budak tu kacau</malay>
okay anyway ya but like she said I think she said like inline skating is kind of
similar like if you can <malay>naik</malay> if you can inline skate then you can ice skate that's what she said
but I'm still assuming it's a new skill
so ya I mean that will be very fun
right and then if you you know especially why <malay>kau tengok kau tengok</malay> movie movie [kan] <malay>dorang tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> pretty women <malay>yang baru punya tu</malay> [eh] pretty women <malay>pula</malay> little women [kan]
and then they there was a scene where joe and laurie <malay>pergi kat</malay> lake and then after that they skate
ice skate at and then amy amy follow but then amy almost died
so ya I was like ya if I live somewhere
where there's a lake
I would definitely learn and there's winter I would definitely learn how to
ice skate for fun
that be fun
two more skills
<malay>jatuh</malay>
ya
<malay>tak hitam ke tak merah tak</malay> sunburn
[oh] okay

ya
<malay>baik</malay> I think <malay>kalau</malay> indonesia <malay>jangan dulu</malay> [ah]
<malay>pasal dorang belum lagi</malay> control <malay>dorang punya</malay>
(err) problem <malay>sikit tapi boleh juga</malay>
embassy malaysia [eh] indonesia <malay>pun tak kasi masuk</malay> [pe]
[ha] [ha] [ha]
<malay>masa tahun depan</malay>
<malay>aku nya</malay> plan <malay>nak kena cari kerja</malay> [lah]
okay <malay>dah dah satu jam</malay> okay continue another day
ya one two three

<malay>atas</malay> view of orchard <malay>tapi</malay> (err) in a budget hotel
(um)
I mean okay [lah] I mean considering <malay>dia punya apa tu</malay> space and all that is really small but I just think that it's quite <malay>macam</malay> convenient and comfortable because <malay>macam</malay> very cosy
ya it's it's really giving me the vibes because <malay>macam</malay> like you have to walk through the <malay>lorong</malay> and all that to find the entrance and then along the way you see people
you see like residential and all that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> I actually do feel like as if I'm not in singapore ya although once you step out onto orchard road then you'll be like [ah] okay
I hate it [oh] my god <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>betul betul</malay> self-conscious [sia] [oh] my god will she see my body
nobody's going to stare I mean I know you're not gonna stare <malay>kalau</malay> like #terglare# and then you like [oh] no
okay thank you thank you
ya of course I need to make sure that it's all covered
I very self-conscious about my body
ya ya I'm fine with it I mean it's not like we <malay>datang selalu</malay> [kan] so
ya then you have to wait [lah] queue then wait for the aunty to like okay <malay>adik berapa orang</malay> okay <malay>dua orang duduk</malay> okay [ah]
<malay>adik</malay> also it's not <malay>abang</malay> okay it's <malay>adik</malay> cause he's younger than us ya
I also don't know [lah] but he look I call him <malay>adik</malay> cause it's just an insult to him can you imagine if it's if you you talk to him [ah] <malay>adik nasi ayam dua</malay> I tell you it'll be so insulting
ya so the thing is now you have wearing masks right he can't really see how our faces look like all or our facial expression so I think it's fine
we'll be like <malay>adik nasi ayam dua satu tak nak sambal</malay>
no no but (err) okay [lah] that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay [lah]
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
not being very friendly because we've always had our encounters with (uh) female <malay>punya</malay> shopkeeper <malay>yang macam</malay> fierce and <malay>garang</malay> right
<malay>nak apa dik nak apa</malay> !huh! <malay>makan</malay> [lah] <malay>dik semua tak nak</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> like [oh] okay [lah] maybe he wants to be one of the first few male stall keepers or store owners ya don't have a very friendly approach to their customers
lucky plaza <malay>sahaja</malay> so I think because you see [eh] the near <malay>nenek atau mak tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya atuk ke apa</malay> they are actually very friendly people ya so I think that's what
attracted people or to you know to want to keep coming and all that cause <malay>dorang tahu macam</malay> [orh] [ah] <malay>nak pakcik ni</malay> cute [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia selalu</malay> smiling
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like [jer] take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
and also because if you are working there and it's lunchtime you wouldn't want to like waste so much time talking and then especially <malay>kalau</malay> queue <malay>makanan kau sampai</malay> of course you want to <malay>cepat-cepat kasi habis</malay> [pe]
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour
okay either way is before or after lunch hour it's not during lunch hour so you can still eat and talk ya
you mean <malay>angkat ayam merah</malay> [oh] ya
[oh] <malay>yang kat tepi</malay> (err)
I think we we bought from there before
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
why
it's okay with fish [mah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[ah] yes [lah]
no you that's the thing you know when it comes to this kind of health issue [kan] sometimes you can be really healthy and all that but it will still happen to you
(mm) I mean <malay>macam</malay> like what I mean is like my brother-in-law
like he he he's on a keto diet he works out and all that <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] ya his diabetic <malay>punya</malay> reading has reduced but his cholesterol level is still high up there so ya it really depends [ah] I mean yes you lead a healthy lifestyle but certain things you cannot avoid
all this while
he did this [one] going on for a couple of years [what] it's just that <malay>macam</malay> he only started <malay>yang</malay> exercise is much more rigorous because (err) he goes I mean he eventually found like <malay>kaki</malay> to you know run and all there and then you know [lah] people <malay>kat sana dorang selalu macam nak</malay>
<malay>buat apa tu</malay> compete <malay>siapa lari lagi banyak</malay> and all that ya
so that's the thing [ah] like he's always been like exercising if he's not running he'll be cycling you know that kind of thing
first thirty years of his life
[oh] ya ya forgot
actually I don't know because I only know them I only know him from twenty six years and above
ya so I don't know how is it like ya but whatever it is there are I mean there are cases whereby <malay>orang macam</malay> like [oh] they lead healthy lifestyle but my children turn out to be diabetic that kind of thing so it really depends [lah] so it's always good to always
(uh) check whether you <malay>punya</malay> you know levels okay <malay>ke tak</malay>
but you never know I very I very scared like I'm always get go home girl checks is like
no [lah] you just tell it for yourself or for your family [lah] the I think that's about it
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
it's very frustrating [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like especially for my brother-in-law cause <malay>dia dah</malay> yes my don't know my blood sugar sugar reading has is now acceptable
cause he's really looking forward to be put back on so <malay>boleh naik pangkat</malay>
ya
ya exactly but because doctor <malay>kata dia ada</malay> this certain levels you know that kind of thing so <malay>dia tak boleh ambil</malay> [ah] ya so he needs to be <malay>macam semua</malay> okay so that he can resume taking then <malay>lepas tu baru dia boleh</malay> considered for (uh) promotion
(mm) I mean like you will be wondering [lah] so I remember <malay>macam</malay> like on <malay>sangat kuruskan badan</malay> [lah] and all that because ya he's stuck there because like <malay>macam</malay> they said that [oh] because of your health you know maybe you cannot do a lot of rigorous work so cannot
get promoted <malay>macam tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
it was really tricky [ah] ya I would suggest him like go go and meet a dietitian or something so that they can look at meal plans
not ya this is going to be a long period [lah] <malay>mana boleh</malay> overnight <malay>turn kau ni pun</malay>
so ya so (um) I mean I was telling [lah] maybe you know nutritionist or dietitian you know tell them that okay I <malay>nak turunkan</malay> my [eh] my cholesterol level so how do I start off how do I do so
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor just <malay>untuk</malay> check <malay>dia punya apa tu</malay> blood sugar level then cholesterol level is nothing to do with <malay>macam</malay> like okay so what am I supposed to do next it's just that <malay>main pun gila</malay> so <malay>aku marah dengan kakak</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
damn
but just <malay>tauge</malay> because (err) okay
(mm) gym-ing I don't know
ya ya that's one thing that I don't really like cause like <malay>macam</malay> you want to be healthy then okay [lor] unless you you know it's really your source of income whereby you share with your viewers what you've been doing so that they can learn from there and all that <malay>tapi setakat macam nak</malay> like show off then (ugh)
maybe that's how they see it as a form of motivation [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
I like <malay>apa tu</malay> make your own plans [lah] as
is it
I don't reply
[oh]
okay okay got it
ya I got it I got it
I mean I don't know whether it's just downright creepy or is it just like very sweet like !aww! you keep track of my life thanks
that's true [lah] that's true [lah]
no more like my father is <malay>atas</malay> not us we're not there yet
you can go shop and see what's there for cyber monday
no [lah] as in like just see [lah] like [oh] you guys have any like special promotion for cyber monday
ya I know cyber money means like online [lah] but you know you never know you can just walk around and like [eh] #terbump# into a shop [eh] got promo [ah]
<malay>apanya yang</malay> birch car <malay>punya</malay> skirt
I you need to refresh my memory
[oh] okay okay (uh) <malay>yang baju lengan pendek tu</malay> [ah] okay okay
but now it's available <malay>kau tak nak beli</malay>
<malay>beli satu</malay> [jer]
(mm) (mm) it's really about whether or not (um) you <malay>nak</malay> better details but you need to take care of the material <malay>ataupun</malay>
and specifically <malay>macam</malay> like you do not have menses on that day
how much is it
no you want to buy three
but okay [lah] I mean have you been buying clothes recently
[oh] okay okay then you need to rethink I buy my clothes every six months
serious
ya I know but it's like okay for me is when I buy I will buy like
four or five pieces of clothing on depends [ah] sometimes I buy more if there's like available designs then I don't I don't spend for the next six months then I wait <malay>macam</malay> cause I <malay>beli tengah</malay> mid year sale <malay>atau</malay> end year sale
and then I will purposely go <malay>bila</malay> (err) towards the end of the sale period I mean I know there's not more there's not many (err) options for me so I just make do with what's available [lah]
ya [lah] I think design sizes it's it's all together [mah] like you will see something that's in your size by it's not what you want and it's you know you want this particular design but the size is not available so technically you'd (mm) just see which one is (um)
you know like okay [lah] <malay>boleh pakai pergi kerja boleh pergi mana</malay> which explains my poor choices of clothing lately [lah] it's really <malay>makcik makcik bodoh</malay> but then
<malay>ada ada yang teruk</malay> [lah] <malay>aku macam terjujur juga</malay>
I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon
no [lah] as in you'll still buy but not as often as before
(mm) (mm) no but you must also always set aside something [lah] like for your self-care and all that <malay>tapi</malay> it's just with self-care fund that you <malay>dah</malay> set aside you have to really properly choose your battle [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like I <malay>nak pergi</malay> let's say [lah] pedi mani mani pedi <malay>ke lagi</malay> massage <malay>ke</malay> you know
(um) hair treatment <malay>ke</malay> so it's really <malay>macam</malay> you have to choose one of those <malay>macam</malay> ya
<malay>macam</malay> staycay you know that kind of thing with your husband that kind of thing ya <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> like I <malay>nak pergi</malay> staycay then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak buat kuku</malay> I I <malay>nak buat rambut</malay> I no no such thing ya
exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles [lah]
(mm) (mm)
maintain [lah] <malay>bengok</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm) of course ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
no it's really about <malay>macam</malay> the people that you you mingle with and all that and whether or not they can actually see the difference because nobody knows or cares like you don't wear the tag outside you know unless you wear a dress that just splash like that kind of thing you know
ya so nobody knows like if you wear this top I don't even know I didn't even remember that you bought it at H&M at #melaka# [oh] it's a very comfortable sweater
ya so technically <malay>kalau macam begitu</malay>
<malay>kalau macam begitu</malay> [lah] it really depends actually ya (um) you what you buy something that you really foresee yourself wearing it a couple of times and you're comfortable with it ya <malay>murah tak kesah asalkan</malay> okay [lah] you <malay>guna</malay> [kan]
<malay>kat</malay> ion yes
ya ya I mean if you want I mean I mean it'll be better if we actually left earlier just now [lah] so you get you get what you are looking for
I mean if don't have also you can always <malay>pergi dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan apa tu yang budak yang baru kena</malay> inject <malay>kat</malay> (uh) spine cause she was heavy breathing yesterday right
ya so basically ya if it didn't work if it doesn't work out today you can always bring him tomorrow [lah]
then <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>naik</malay> Grab (mm)
ya exactly but he can what he can do is just (uh) call the hospital just to inform and then after that (err) tell them that I will update again when I'm collecting [lah] than <malay>daripada</malay> keep quiet call <malay>kena</malay> towed away you know we don't want that to happen
I don't know because if it's been there and no one claimed it they will also want to remove it in case [orh] other people want to use the slot and all that
why would you not inform the building or the hospital building that you have left a vehicle there <malay>bodoh</malay> [sia]
ya but the doctor's not gonna keep checking every single time [eh] <malay>motor ada kat situ tak motor ada kat situ tak</malay>
(mm) (mm) so ya [lah] <malay>nak kena kena</malay> actually call or inform at least just to check
(mm) ya
very smart boy
(mm) I mean you can always check back with the doctor [lah] like is it normal to feel this way
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[ah] okay okay
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
never it's my first time I mean I've heard of it before <malay>tapi</malay>
no never because I think because of location <malay>macam</malay>
it was at #bedok# [eh] not like #punggol# or something
!yay!
ya so far so <malay>tak tak hairan</malay> [lah]
(mm) okay okay
okay [lah] I'm actually quite excited [lah] looking forward to it cause I don't know what to expect and the I think it's quite been it's been quite a long time since I last had steak
ya I think the last time we had steak was (um) last year at Elfuego
ya
ya [lah] that was even later you know that was in october ya so the <malay>paling</malay> recent <malay>pun</malay>
in december
ya can you imagine [oh] my god <malay>letak</malay> the kids at home I need to get them out
no [lah] because you have to book in cause you just you just got the vouchers right so you can only book <malay>macam</malay> only now [lah] recently <malay>sebelum ni tak boleh</malay> book in advance
ya ya ya staycay is that [one] [lah] that [one] is a given <malay>itu ada</malay> book (err) quite early
<malay>tapi macam</malay> like
ya [lah] new year <malay>pun</malay> expensive [lah] <malay>mana mana</malay> expensive [seh] cause <malay>nak</malay> step <malay>tengok</malay> fireworks [ah] and all that
okay [ah]
can you imagine you stay here then <malay>kau nampak kat hujung</malay> there's fireworks okay [ah]
[eh] but if you have new year's eve <malay>kat sini</malay> then you look out quite nice [eh]
I mean if [lah] I say and the view itself quite nice [mah]

I mean you can do a lot go jewel walk walk look at the fountain <malay>kat sana tengok momok</malay>
gross
I mean you can see [lah] from the pictures but you don't have to book
ya the thing is <malay>kadang kala</malay> how soon are you even going to set foot out of singapore I mean <malay>kalau nak kata</malay> [kan] #pulau ubin# okay [lah] [eh] but you you don't need a passport for that <malay>tapi</malay> I mean like international-wise
I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon [ah] maybe like <malay>macam pertengahan</malay> twenty twenty one
I <malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku mana tahu</malay>
they delayed because (err) <malay>tiba-tiba ada</malay> the spike in the number of cases [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] serious [ah] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] okay okay
so they have an office there [lah] actually
and sketchy <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya it's true
sure [lor]
I think <malay>macam</malay> I think <malay>kat</malay> thailand <malay>macam tak teruk sangat kau tahu tapi yang teruk</malay> would be <malay>macam kat</malay> (um) malaysia
because I think number of cases so far <malay>yang dorang</malay> report <malay>kat</malay> news thailand <malay>macam tak ada</malay> [jer]
mean <malay>ada yang tempat</malay> rural <malay>ke</malay>
I mean for him is like we shouldn't have had done more tests right <malay>bodoh</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) understand understand
but there are some states just living in denial
ya like you know we have our rights we have our amendments and all that then okay [lah] <malay>kasut kau orang</malay> [lah] I feel like these are the people that shouldn't be getting any (err) medical attention if they ever get COVID
(mm)
all over the country [oh] <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] good job
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] [lah]
[ah] natural selection
(mm)
(mmhmm)
how sure are you there are the same group of people <malay>mungkin tak</malay> [lah] <malay>ada tapi segelintir</malay>
<malay>daripada dorang ada buat merepek ni</malay> then you like [ah] <malay>korang minta kena sepak</malay>
ya you know that time <malay>dekat</malay> asia one [kan] <malay>tunjuk dua budak remaja kat dalam</malay> train <malay>tak pakai</malay> mask <malay>bodoh betul</malay>
that's the thing someone took a picture but then after that I don't know whether any actions were taking they taken by you know the safe distancing ambassador <malay>atau</malay> the staff and all that
so like I I just feel like <malay>kadang-kadang orang</malay> singapore <malay>ini</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang banyak</malay> complain <malay>banyak ambil gambar banyak</malay> submit video when it comes to action it's zero so annoying
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>segelintir</malay>
[ah]
<malay>dia kena saman</malay>
no <malay>dia kena saman</malay> lazarus island <malay>pun sama semua kena saman</malay>
no no no jail
why would you wanna jail them
you cannot jail people immediately just for that one incident [what]
I feel like you <malay>kalau</malay> jail <malay>yang perempuan yang kata mana tak</malay>
[ah]
ya that [one] she does it she did it repeatedly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to talk about jail then she should be jailed because like first time <malay>tak serik</malay> second time <malay>tak serik</malay>
you think these people got no money [meh] to pay
ya [lah] but the thing is it still has to be fair for everyone [lah] like got the first time okay <malay>kalau kau buat lagi</malay> then that's it <malay>kau minta kena sepak</malay> you know that kind of thing
(mm)
<malay>apa dia</malay> we have what
(mm) (mm)
no the thing is #adela# they have different arrangement #adela# so <malay>macam</malay> like offices right now right they said [ah] cannot have more than fifty employees at one time
okay and then like in my office right they have that <malay>macam</malay>
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measures [lah]
ya except when I eat [lah]
[orh]
ya so there's there's rules and regulation [lah] it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
(mm)
ya must wear in case like people from the other (um) you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you [ah] getting that [lah]
(mm)
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed [oh] my god
[kan] <malay>begini</malay> [ah] [seh]
the below the eyes cannot make it [lah] [ah]
#khatib# #khatib# <malay>kat mana ni</malay>
[oh] <malay>kat</malay> #yishun# <malay>itu</malay>

okay I don't mind going there
<malay>panjat panjat panjat</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
(uh)
then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
but <malay>ada</malay> [lah] I've been avoiding arrows so much
arrow at work okay [lah] it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations
thanks thanks
I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
!alah! <malay>kesian</malay>

I think no [lah] maybe just because like I don't know maybe <malay>dorang main</malay> game and then it's nice to talk and because it's really a place for you to <malay>macam</malay> vent you know <malay>dekat rumah</malay> you know that kind of thing

is is is is surprising because you know why <malay>pasal mereka berbual dalam</malay> telephone [kan] [eh] <malay>dalam</malay> game okay <malay>abang dah habis ngaji bang</malay> okay <malay>sekarang barang simpan dalam beg lepas tu balik bilik tidur</malay> [eh]
<malay>adik adik macam mana adik</malay> homework <malay>dah habis ke dik</malay> okay <malay>kalau dah habis tu kalau tak buat kasi habis dah habis nanti abah</malay> check <malay>nanti adik boleh tidur</malay>
ya
no they don't talk [lah] during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
[ah] so they know how to
ya ya ya ya [ah] [ah]
ya
[ah]
so it's normal [lah] I mean like there are people who can actually like set aside time you know (err) really manage time and all that <malay>tapi ada tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang macam bengap semacam</malay>
I mean like there are a few <malay>macam</malay> like shirk responsibility <malay>sanggup balik rumah lambat</malay> and all that <malay>pasal nak main</malay> game <malay>kat luar</malay>
<malay>tak tahu mana aku tahu</malay> but long time never play with the person so I also don't know what happen to him
ya I already at that point of time I thought <malay>dia belum kahwin tahu</malay> because (uh) my that time my friend was like <malay>kau dekat rumah bujang</malay> (uh) (uh) then I was like <malay>rumah bujang</malay> then after that I ask my friend then I said <malay>rumah bujang tu apa dia kata macam</malay> like you know like basically is what they mean like for us is void deck <malay>tapi dorang mana rumah</malay> flat <malay>kat situ</malay> [kan] so is <malay>macam</malay> like those
<malay>pondok-pondok</malay> like <malay>kosong</malay> like people rest
(mm) (mm) <malay>macam itu</malay> [lah] along the road <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) so that's what they call <malay>rumah bujang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak tak tepi</malay> road [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] correct ya ya correct [ah] [ah] [ah] [lah] [sial]
then <malay>aku</malay> <malay>aku macam</malay> cause <malay>nanti dia macam</malay> like okay <malay>aku nak balik</malay>
then like and then I'll be like
[eh] <malay>kat mana ni sekarang</malay>
[eh] <malay>lawa kat rumah bujang ni</malay> then I was like that's when like I was I was like asking my friend after he left the group [ah] the lobby right
<malay>dia tanya kau orang</malay> [eh]
(uh) <malay>rumah bujang tu apa rumah tempat dorang lepak-lepaknya</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> like okay <malay>rumah dia tak boleh lepak ke</malay> and then he's like <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] you <malay>tanya dia sendiri</malay>
ya and then that time I managed to ask the person [lah] I said <malay>asal kau tak main kat rumah sendiri</malay> (err) <malay>dia kata kat rumah dia punya</malay> internet <malay>tak bagus pasal kat dia nya rumah dekat-dekat dengan hutan-hutan situ</malay>
fair enough because like <malay>macam awak</malay> that time even like normal phone reception
was really bad because it's really near the <malay>hutan</malay>
ya so I'm like okay [lah] fair enough [lah] <malay>desak kau kau buat apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>kimak</malay>
ya [lah] data <malay>pun tak boleh</malay>
#adela# I
ya it's just cause it's really because of reception so-called research <malay>tak bagus</malay> data <malay>pun tak bagus</malay>
[ah]
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
actually right I think it's just the telco problem because like my friend's <malay>kat</malay> itself like the area itself is not that highland it's quite <malay>macam</malay> low to medium right depending [ah]
they also experience bad reception [leh] and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then [kan]
<malay>nanti macam macam dorang kata bagus tapi aku dah tukar macam tak bagus tukar balik tukar balik</malay>
ya
so ya so I think it's just the country telcos [lah] <malay>lepas</malay> !alah!
[kan] <malay>macam kat atas bukit pun boleh kau ambil</malay>
video
#mashallah#
ya ya I do that <malay>tapi nak kena ada</malay> portable charger [lah] or maybe (mm) (mm) (mm)
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
<malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> like (err) either a portable charger then I can play for awhile and then after that charge my phone like for a while
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) <malay>betul betul</malay>
!oi!
[oh] really when
all the best girl
okay
[oh] my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
it's literally <malay>macam cucuk selah</malay>
[oh] my god it was painful I was like just
[oh] my god
<malay>apa pasal aku berdarah</malay> [sia] <malay>kat bawah</malay>
[ah]
like I feel like I fell like <malay>macam</malay> I be right again
feel so hurt
so <malay>macam lepas tu aku pergi</malay> toilet [kan] I <malay>kencing lepas tu aku tengok ada darah</malay> I was like
<malay>takut bilang kau</malay> that time
<malay>akunya akunya benda baik balik</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] but it really hurts [ah] it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist [lah]
is because it's really <malay>macam masuk</malay> then <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> clamp <malay>sakit bodoh</malay>
<malay>kau belum kena lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>berbual banyak</malay> !huh!
<malay>apa dia</malay>
what do you mean by lube
[oh] lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
they do put the <malay>benda macam</malay> gel like cold gel or warm gel don't remember at your your area there
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that [one] they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay [lah]
no it's very fast it's not even five minutes it's lesser than that <malay>cuma</malay> like the initial part a bit painful [lah]
ya
it depends [lah] like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
you know it think about it it's for your health so you just do it it's very fast the <malay>cepat</malay> and you get the result on the spot also
ya ya correct
(mm) (mm)
ya so no worry [lah] I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check (err) about her the ovaries her uterus
[ah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> fibroid <malay>ke tak</malay> so <malay>buat buat sekali</malay> [lah] and then
I know but the thing is my mum also was in pain and then she was like <malay>macam</malay> like she let up a yelp right and then after that I'm like <malay>begini sudah beranak dua</malay> no I said no I said I said <malay>dah beranak dua kali pun nak bising</malay> and then when I <malay>kena</malay>
okay no she wasn't there right so when I told her <malay>sakit baru kau tahu macam sakit</malay> she's like
I don't know why but she's always been waiting to use that line on her children like I still remember that time when my sister first give birth and she was complaining to my mum like <malay>sakitnya badan berapa sakitnya</malay> then she's like <malay>baru kau tahu macam mana sakitnya beranakan</malay>
then I was like
<malay>ada ambil</malay> [ah]
[eh] but then when I was at the clinic <malay>ini</malay> [kan] it's so awkward
because <malay>semua orang datang dengan dorang punya</malay> partner I went there alone
and then the lady just the reception's like madam #fadilah# I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
<malay>tak tahu apa nak buat kesian</malay> like husband <malay>pandai buat</malay> you know that kind of thing
(mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>bila nak</malay> penetrate <malay>semua nak</malay> ya <malay>bodohnya jantan</malay>
ya <malay>depan belakang tak boleh</malay> okay <malay>pusat pun boleh</malay>
<malay>pusat tak boleh telinga hidung semua masuk</malay>
ya
ya <malay>air air</malay> I also quite a number of people [lah] you know people in who had late pregnancies then I see teenagers with their mum it's so it's quite sad actually
(mm) and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
like I pretend <malay>macam dengar</malay> music <malay>daripada hal</malay>
[ah] Spotify off
and
ya and but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
<malay>tak nampak</malay> pregnant [ah] <malay>tapi dia macam nangis</malay> [lah] but I wanted to tell the mum like you're doing a great job ya
ya
so like then I didn't say [lah] I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
[eh] [eh]
unless <malay>ada orang tolong jagakan anak dia</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm) <malay>lepas beranak</malay> [ah] (mm) (mm)
(mm)
seventeen
(mm) (mm)
I I no okay [lah] I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya [oh] my god
but I feel like for them like sexual education had to start like really early you know
<malay>macam</malay> like sexual education but not about abstaining like I think that abstaining not !aduh! what is not a question anymore you know cause like they're doing it at a very young age I think it's more about <malay>macam</malay> how to have sex responsibly or safely
then throw outside [lah]
not strong [ah]
<malay>pakai tu</malay> [lah] saran wrap
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya because (err) (err) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> you know before when they did that ligation right maybe an egg has already been released
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after menstrual cycle
(mm) (mm)
ya
[orh] okay
I mean it's good [lah] then she has options you know that kind of thing
catch ball [mah] that's why
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
but it's quite worrying [ah] I I think it's happening in singapore it's just that we are not
very conservative [ah] mindset
damn girl where do you get access

something like that [lah] [ah] if not at work I'll be at home [lah] you know the the deal right [ah]
(uh)
(err) sadly due to the circuit breaker the the zoo closed down <malay>jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kerja</malay> [tau] (err)
[ah]
ya I I got said already ya
[ah] it is
compared the zoo they pay more but they and their shift is also slightly shorter [lah]
but (err) I would say the experience there is (err) pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of <malay>macam</malay> tourists
(err) you have a lot of fun [lah] especially with like your co-workers
but the the thing about challenger is different people works for different shift so
you you meet new people [lah] every time you work

ya
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[orh]
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's I think five months
so you expect the baby to appear at [eh] appear [eh] they expect for the baby to be born [lah] in (err) <malay>dalam</malay> late november <malay>begitu</malay>
so
ya all of us are pretty excited [lah] <malay>kita</malay> even <malay>macam dah buat</malay> a baby shower (um) [eh] not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya I I mean it's just to lighten up everyone <malay>punya</malay> spirits [lah] given ya this <malay>macam</malay> hard
time right
ya and I and my <malay>kakak</malay> #wen# is the
<malay>anak pertama</malay> [lah] to carry a child for the family
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
so ya my my mother and my (uh) brother-in-law <malay>punya</malay> mother both of them plan out [lah] the this party for us
so <malay>harap harap</malay> (err) it's going to be fun (err) it's gonna happen I think [ah] early next month also
near #sharmin's# birthday I think
ya her mother will <malay>masak makanan</malay> for us and then after that my mum will plan out <malay>dia punya</malay> games and
(err) <malay>aktiviti-aktiviti</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita akan buat</malay> on that day itself
nah who who who I mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
the government <malay>punya pantang larang</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti ikut</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> respect respectable [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
<malay>malu</malay> [lah]
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
because she can still (err) go to work [lah] but her <malay>macam orang atas</malay> don't want her to come
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
because he works at the port right so he helps (err) he is a I think I think he's an engineer then <malay>dia tolong macam pasang</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau ada</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> equipment <malay>yang rosak</malay>
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so I I think he <malay>macam gembira</malay> [ah] like !wow! finally he get a job [ah]
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
(err) [ah] school (err) <malay>apa tu yuran</malay> ya <malay>yuran sekolah</malay> unlike us [lah] for for
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) I think really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level [seh] ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five [ah]
(mm)
my sorry what
[oh] my girlfriend [ah] [oh] she's she's fine [lah] because [ah] she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it [lah] how [ah] it's very interesting
then <malay>dia orang tayangkan</malay> the whole thing on (err) facebook live
so they will (err) how to say this they will
it would screen your names I think in terms of your school
so they will be like [oh] [ah] school of engineering <malay>dekat bawah</malay> [jer] <malay>nama-nama dia punya</malay> students ya in that slow
ya ya in that type of (uh)
effect ya format ya
[ah] facebook facebook live
then (uh) she that's for the general cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her (uh) school of (uh)
mathematics
(err) they had a zoom
so in that zoom session <malay>dia orang ada buat macam</malay> lucky draw [lah] so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods (err) jabra elite mostly <malay>macam</malay> those school technology gadgets [lah]
ya <malay>dia lagi sikit menang</malay> [seh] she said (err) she said (err) the one that wins ya it's usually like either <malay>dua ke atas dua ke bawah</malay> so
what they found out from her name [ah]
ya
I mean [ah] aren't we all sore losers some days [ah]
[oh] (uh) it ended like I think two hours ago and after that she went
[ah] she went out [lah] with her family cause (err)
ya convocation ya but I forgot that
I actually ordered (err) ice cream <malay>untuk dia</malay> so like
ya then <malay>kat rumah</malay> I think got no one so (uh) ya I ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then I'm not sure [lah] cause the number is
[ah] the number I gave to the company is her number so I mean worst come to worst they will call her [lah] but they said they don't provide any dry ice so I'm hoping that <malay>dia balik sebelum</malay>

the <malay>daerah</malay> canberra
so ya like when we were still freshies on the fire ground it was a bit scary [lah] because we don't know what to expect
meanwhile they told us in training is <malay>lain</malay> what from what you are going experience real life
ya but honestly the he is a really good good buddy [lah] to have when it comes to firefighting
ya
ya I'm I'm sure you have the same
experience when you what serving your time as the police right
what what what what you doing [ah] in police
[oh] [oh] so so you so you were like <malay>macam</malay> patrolman [lah] <malay>gitu ronda-ronda</malay> around the area
[ah]
the (err)
okay
[oh]
ya [lah]
!wah! they are not worrying [ah] like you I mean do you get calls often or <malay>macam takde masalah ke</malay> in the area
[oh] (err) I mean like since you are posted in a the area <malay>macam tak ramai orang</malay> [kan] so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
(um)
[oh]
understand [lah]
understand understand
ya I had I had a lot of fun in yes
<malay>macam tak</malay> pressure [lah] <malay>orang tak</malay> I don't feel <malay>macam orang</malay> bully you or anything
ya
[ah] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>hibur-hiburkan</malay> [lah] so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially I mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
you know that it was just the that's a wrong day [lah] wrong time
(mm)
ya true true
ya well how you spend the rest of your day man
[oh] <malay>lari-lari anak</malay> around area
[ah]
but but usually <malay>berapa jauh</malay> you run
[oh]

<malay>macam</malay> the only only time I ran <malay>jauh gitu</malay> is back when I was in serving my [lah] they make us run around #ubin#
(mm)
ya correct [lah] true true
[ah]
that's not bad
ya
and I think that's the way [lah] <malay>macam orang tak tahu</malay> you cannot drink a lot <malay>kalau nak minum sikit</malay> [jer] <malay>kalau boleh jangan minum</malay> at all
(uh) <malay>habis</malay>
thirty minutes <malay>baru</malay> [jer] <malay>minum</malay> that that's the ideology that
I don't know [lah] but that's what I see [lah]
[ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya
I see [ah] is is you want it you want to drink just to quest [eh] quench your thirst but not to
(mm)
ya cause I I got I make [lah] this (err) module in back when I was in my first year university
ya it's about biology larh and then [oh] <malay>ada</malay> mention <malay>yang</malay> if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
making your performance worse than if you
control your drinking [lah]
which is true [lah] ya cause they also mentioned that actually heatstroke [eh] no sorry not heatstroke on the heatstroke I think [ah] ya heatstroke ya heatstroke it's not because you don't drink too much
it's because
you know [eh]
ya
ya it it can be that and also you didn't <malay>ni</malay> [lah] (um) [ah] wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so <malay>kita tak boleh kita tak boleh</malay> push too much [lah] <malay>nanti orang cakap</malay> [kan]
correct [lah] correct
(mm)
ya ya true
but okay [lah] I mean now at least the general public has the idea [lah] that
(mm)
K [lah]
ya
drinking
[oh] [ah] nah man I
I kind of stopped drinking [ah] so
how about you man
ya ya that's nice that's nice
I
apple juice [eh]
but ya <malay>berapa banyak</malay> juice you <malay>suka minum</malay> in one day <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh]
okay true [lah] because like for me <malay>macam</malay> I want to avoid drinking gassy drinks [kan] <malay>macam air air air yang</malay> sweet <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>boleh mendatangkan kencing manis</malay> so
ya so (uh) at home <malay>pun</malay> I only got <malay>air masak</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> most of the time the only [ah] the best alternative would definitely be juices [ah]
so
I will go for orange juices and carrot juice but my favorite juice will be the
[ah] lime juice [ah]
[oh] no I don't like to buy all these <malay>macam</malay> manufactured <malay>punya</malay> cause I feel <malay>macam dia tak mendatangkan</malay> any
(err) well
<malay>apa tu</malay> benefit [lah] so I <malay>selalu beli pergi pasar</malay> then I <malay>beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan</malay>
[ah] <malay>biji biji buah-buahan</malay> then I <malay>balik</malay> I <malay>potong</malay> I blend
then I <malay>letak air</malay> then I <malay>minum</malay> [ah]
ya my
it's right way ya my <malay>ni</malay> if you if you if you if you got the time my <malay>ni</malay> always recommend [lah] when you blend [kan] you blend <malay>dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali</malay>
[ah] <malay>dengan kulit-kulit dia</malay> but the <malay>biji</malay> the <malay>biji</malay> you take out
okay [lah] the <malay>kulit</malay> (err)
how to say [ah] mine gonna like (err)
if you blend enough right the the whole drink will will come in well [lah] smooth
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>apa dia apa</malay> I heard some fruits [eh] if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good [lah] <malay>jadi kena macam pandai-pandai</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya [oh] [eh] grapefruit <malay>dengan</malay> grape is <malay>lain</malay> [eh] <malay>tak sama</malay> [eh]
grapefruit <malay>dengan</malay> grape <malay>dia orang tak sama</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> two different fruits [ah] <malay>lain</malay> [kan]
[oh]
grapefruit [ah]
<malay>siapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> come out [eh] <malay>nama-nama ni</malay>

(mm) correct correct

#stalisha#
my day today is very tiring obviously (um) it's been two days [ah] I sleep very late
<malay>dalam pukul enam pagi</malay>
because I started a business selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> yes
(um) and so far it's been well (um) it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring [lah]
basically because I like to eat <malay>tahu begedil</malay>
(um) quite recently [eh] [ah] like last month [ah] late last month when <malay>tahu begedil</malay> was was like a trend
(um) it's among the home-based sellers [lah]
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
(um) <malay>tahu begedil</malay> and they both
have their
<malay>apa tu macam ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya kesedapan tu</malay> [kan] ya
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
for a while because <malay>ibu</malay> force me to
but (um) making this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> of course I only started recently
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
(um) [eh] I mean there were no <malay>macam kedai</malay> taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
[ah] [ah]
customers [ah]
yes
delivery is
(um) by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya [ah] so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight [lah] hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
(um)
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
[ah] I have school I have (um) freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
so I think [ah] this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I will only sell <malay>bila ada</malay> time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> holidays
ya
go [ah] because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change [lah] because I like to bake also
so maybe like maybe the next week is not <malay>tahu begedil</malay> it's like
(um) brownies or cookies something like that
branding
[oh] I didn't call I didn't name it but <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> named it as
#tahbegs# #tahbegs#
ya it's #tahbegs# is from #tahu# and #begedil# but we make it very hipster
so it's #tahbegs#
ya T H B E G S
[oh] ya (um) I also own a small business selling #bawals#
<malay>bawal</malay> yes <malay>tudung bawal</malay> you know there's square scarf
[eh] it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be [eh] next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
(um) one is the our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk <malay>bawal</malay> and our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> it sells
(um) better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
[ah] because (um) me and my partner [lah]
ya we we
<malay>kita suka</malay> try <malay>benda</malay> like try to do things new things and we try to ya [lah]
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
we hustle a lot <malay>macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau hari-hari kerja</malay>
<malay>asalkan</malay> like <malay>kita boleh rasa duit tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] #inshallah# !wah! <malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>benda yang halal</malay>
twenty one
that young
[oh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
that's the best you can sleep
[oh] okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
[oh] (mm) [ah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay
(uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
I you like wrapped
[oh] like <malay>mati macam melayu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
[oh] my god
they didn't pay you
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] I see
(um)
what am I doing at nineteen
(um) I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
(um)
there was this
<malay>apa tu</malay> open casting for new models
and then (um) I was very camera shy last time
like <malay>tak suka ambil gambar</malay> and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a <malay>hijabi</malay> model
so I'm like [meh] like I I don't even bother [lah] but then my partner saw like [eh] you should try [lah] you just try then [orh]
I said no I don't want (err) I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the (um) the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
[ah] he applied to two [ah] company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
[ah] it was an unpaid job
for
(um) until I was maybe
(um) nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
(um)
by their apparel
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't <malay>simpan</malay> because the quality is like shit
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like (um) the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
and then I come back with just a piece of <malay>tudung</malay> for me it's like <malay>merepek</malay> so
(err) when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
<malay>ibu</malay> (um)
tell me [lah] like [oh] you need to start
(um) charging these people because you are having a lot of (um)
<malay>apa ni</malay> (um) shops coming to you (uh) for shooting she said then okay [lah] I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
and #alhamdulillah# it also went well
[ah]
people also come to me (um) to do to create <malay>apa</malay> to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
(um) sell their products [ah]
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
I don't know whatever <malay>barang</malay> that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried (uh) an influencer before to boost start my (um) Kamash (um) the <malay>tudung</malay> brand
(uh) and it didn't work [ah]
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because [ah] her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales [lah] so I was like okay (um) actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they (um) they really spread the word and tag you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
other companies ya
(mmhmm)
usually (um) before we post something right for the company we also like send the
<malay>apa tu</malay> our
what do they call it
okay [lah] the context [ah] the context of the post [ah] we
ya the description we always like (um) send it
to the company first let them approve <malay>apa-apa macam</malay> if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people [ah] <malay>macam tambah-tambah</malay> [lah] [ah] themselves and then they
then they send back to us then <malay>baru kita</malay> copy paste and then put
[ah] on our post
(uh) it's our post because we are like (um) ya
usually is like that
[ah] no that that's the thing that's why I don't (um) I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like (um) they told me [lah] like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
(um) is very difficult
(um) and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle [lah] but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school (um) there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson (um) end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night [lah] something like that
ya it's like it's very bad [lah] is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up (uh) my own company [ah]
selling clothes selling <malay>muslimah</malay> clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
(um)
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
!alamak! we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
(mm)
because all of this (um) of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
(um) creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well [lah] and
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] you need to do your research (err) do survey do prototype everything
(uh) (uh)
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
(um) sellers <malay>terdahulu biasa</malay> about <malay>apa yang dorang suka</malay> instead of what
their customers like
you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay> they
assume that [orh] <malay>aku suka ni</malay> so confirm <malay>orang lain akan suka</malay>
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face [lah] when I'm opening this (um) Kamash
<malay>pasal</malay> (um) a lot of people say [eh] <malay>ni lawa</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> but we cannot hear what our family members really (um) say we need to reach out to people
(um)
yes
and
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum [ah] she said like [orh] <malay>ni</malay> colour <malay>cantik</malay> everything whatever shit
but then actually <malay>salah</malay> [ah] it's not selling our first
out first what [ah] [ah]
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
simple <malay>macam</malay> not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful <malay>tapi</malay> a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like [eh] [eh] <malay>ni mana ada orang pakai</malay> cotton <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> but it sell out like a lot (um) we bought I'm ten colours
eight colours already sold out
ya
[ah] we manufacture ourself
[ah] no (uh) we liaise with a factory in #jakarta#
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
(mm)
no [lah] I mean like obviously (uh) when you grow up
[eh]
[ah] my god okay it needs to switch
naturally (um)
<malay>bila dah membesar</malay> right <malay>sambil membesar</malay>
ya <malay>sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar</malay> [tau] <malay>apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka</malay>
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then <malay>ibu tak suka</malay> so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
(um) she said [oh] you know (um) <malay>macam</malay> she tell told me all the negative things [lah] all the
cons about being a nurse
and then [ah]
it's like <malay>jaga mayat</malay> <malay>jaga mayat</malay> and then like
some personal reasons [lah] for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
but of course <malay>ibu</malay> also <malay>tak kasi</malay> because she say I will <malay>mati cepat</malay> the I'm like <malay>kalau ajal tu ada mati</malay> [lah] I mean like we cannot
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
those type of
incident
car crash [eh] plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee [what]
and
ya [lah] exactly then I was like okay sure
so [ah] basically [ah]
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what <malay>ibu</malay> wants me to do [lah]
so I'm like okay [lah] since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
(um) ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor [orh] an acting
[orh] okay [ah] clown doctor
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
[oh] okay
(uh)
I can fix my own teeth
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
ya
[oh] my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
[eh] the first ya your first show is it
is the <malay>hantu</malay> remember
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little <malay>masih kecil</malay> [kan] that time
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like !wah!
well quite nice [lor]
so
ya
but it was good though
(mm)
[oh] I see
[oh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
ya that's that's the thing
(um) usually people are afraid to set a price
(um)
we calculate our expenses [ah] and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see [lah] (um) like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like [oh] we can sell it from this price to this price no (uh) no lower than that
if it's lower than that (um) means
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>aku rugi</malay> [lah] (mm) (mm)
obviously <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like [oh] I need to to control myself because
<malay>dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> okay <malay>aku tak boleh tak makan</malay> but if I can
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not #chai# I don't like #chai#
[oh] really
[oh] I see
[ah] [ah]
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
[oh] my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
[oh] okay you thinking far
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I don't know [ah] I feel like
even if people <malay>bila</malay>
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
[oh] ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge (um) washing machine
!wow! such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in [what] and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
<malay>silat</malay> ya but then we stop because like (um)
the <malay>penjuru</malay> is it the guru the head of the <malay>silat</malay> or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he <malay>campur</malay> with
<malay>benda tak elok</malay> [lah] (um) with
<malay>jin</malay> yes
no sister his sister <malay>yang ini kat luar</malay> I it was at #sengkang# it was at #sengkang# you know those <malay>macam</malay> got court badminton court ya we <malay>silat</malay> there
and then like I was training at
one point of time <malay>macam tengah buat benda sendiri</malay> [ah] and then like
<malay>tapi</malay> like I saw this <malay>guru</malay> and this student like a teenage student
(um) <malay>tengah terbaring</malay> [tau]
and then
the guru is like <malay>macam gitu macam baca-baca</malay> then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like (um) like what <malay>macam dia sakit ke</malay> I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person <malay>rasuk</malay> [lah] <malay>katakan</malay>
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's (um)
one of our uncle also was in the same <malay>silat</malay> with us <malay>siapa tu</malay> [ah] #ariff# [ah] he quitted first and then we quit
so ya
I feel like is a traditional (err) okay (um) one thing I learned about <malay>silat</malay> while doing my research for my last time was
the their <malay>silat</malay> is actually
(um) how to say [ah]
they hold their respect [lah] towards their opponent
[a'ah] <malay>tekan</malay>
like how to say (um) okay <malay>selalunya sekarang orang kat luar</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang gaduh</malay> [kan] <malay>dia rembat</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu</malay> when they are in a battle
(um) they <malay>tunjuk</malay> respect to one another first and they you know <malay>buka bunga</malay> is where you show like [oh] are you ready
to <malay>silat</malay> then ya
ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
like are ready to like [ah] I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
last time they really gold the <malay>adat</malay> [lah]
various [lah] <malay>silat</malay> #taekwando#
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya
(um)
but
ya
so you literally need to fly
you need to like jump and like
[oh] okay okay okay I can see
(mm)
counselling
no
for who for kids
[oh]
ya
no violent cause
no
!huh!
(uh huh)
cannot two weeks [ah]
ya
as long as you <malay>belah</malay> after two weeks [ah] I don't mind
<malay>lama</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
like being straightforward it's like just say [lah] like [oh] <malay>apa</malay> I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
but to them I say [oh] okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
like (uh) <malay>aku akan ambil macam angkat</malay> [ah] <malay>baju-baju kotor ni</malay> but some people see it as rude <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
(uh) so <malay>macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kena buat semua benda</malay> [ah] <malay>kat rumah ni</malay>
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know [eh]
ya the <malay>melayu</malay> so formal I cannot
[ah] no we only speak it when <malay>ada</malay> oral <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! that was so long time ago
<malay>melayu</malay>
with <malay>abang</malay>
<malay>biasanya</malay> with <malay>abang</malay> or <malay>ibu</malay> a bit [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> [lah] like transition between english and malay but for #hilah# hundred percent english
ya and !wow! her malay is just
I think her malay is very formal
ya
ya
(uh)
[ah] I also don't know [eh] but (um) one of my friends like <malay>dia sekarang dalam</malay> uni and he is a
he major in journalist <malay>bahasa melayu</malay> [lah] so
when I see his works he !wah! like
I feel like
I don't know malay at all because it's another
language ya <malay>macam ada perkataan</malay> like <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like
<malay>bahasa melayu ni</malay> is not for today [lah]
it's more of
<malay>orang dulu-dulu</malay> because <malay>orang dulu</malay>
<malay>macam bahasa baku</malay> [kan]
ya correct
it's
like singlish [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we don't usually speak like this but
along the way people <malay>macam</malay> get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of <malay>dekat kau kena</malay>
did you like
<malay>lima minit</malay> short <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah]
okay I can stop it already [ah]

I heard
if you want to go together then <malay>kena</malay> apply online [kan] to get the queue
[oh]
so should I apply like
like how long how much in advance can I apply now now can already [leh]
[orh]
[oh]
<malay>dia orang</malay> fast game [ah] [dah] apply online
ya but how's the slots like though
the best seats is <malay>tingkat berapa</malay>
[oh]
cause closer to god [kan]
(mm) so that means the the
<malay>takde yang rapatkan saf</malay> [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
I heard
the <malay>wuduk</malay> area now they <malay>dia orang taruh apa</malay> sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay okay [oh] so they they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means <malay>salam pun tak boleh</malay> [ah]
[ah] okay okay
the gentle gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
I mean
ya
<malay>orang</malay> only the <malay>orang atas</malay> would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one <malay>pun</malay> mostly <malay>kat</malay> my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old <malay>kedai kopi</malay> and (err) you know the mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast <malay>punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng</malay>
ya

ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya I did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that <malay>macam dah</malay> second nature [kan] <malay>ambil wuduk</malay>
(um)
ya I mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] <malay>cik jamal</malay> [oh] I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest <malay>punya</malay> supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] I I think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
I'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right

cause you <malay>punya</malay> opponent (mm)
ya correct correct
mid table but <malay>kalau menang</malay> the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa europa
ya champions league [dah]
<malay>dah tak boleh dah</malay>
a bit out of reach [ah] ya <malay>jauh sangat</malay>

quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)

how emotion emotional football gets [ah]

(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a <malay>budak baik</malay> [lah]
and (uh)
<malay>polis</malay>
ya
ya I was at (err) I was at the and #ang mo kio# over there ya
ya correct correct
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya as me
ya so a bit <malay>sedih</malay> [ah]
cause they cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so I <malay>kena</malay> posted <malay>kat</malay> foxtrot division [ah] <malay>tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat</malay> this area [ah]
sorry sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] I would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like <malay>macam</malay> woodlands #jurong#
ya I would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I I feel the same way [ah] as as much as like you know the <malay>berita dia orang</malay> cover and all these cases of
<malay>macam</malay> mismanagement
ya
I think it's isolated <malay>punya</malay> cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm)
true true
ya
cause <malay>biasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] I would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish (err)
I wish I have plans after this [ah] but sadly I don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
I usually go for a minimum ten [ah]
ya
you know ten run ya
I think I mean
[kan] <malay>kena</malay> stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya but I think is <malay>tak susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] but it's
<malay>kena biasakan</malay> so
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you when you first start [lah] like after one ten and then usually you <malay>togok air</malay> like <malay>melampau</malay> [ah] but
now I barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct correct correct I that one I fully agree [ah] [kan] I mean cause <malay>banyak orang banyak orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak begitu</malay> informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay>
the
it is the right way [lah] is to <malay>jangan minum banyak</malay> [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like <malay>macam</malay>
it's it's it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but but not to you know pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
<malay>kena</malay> full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you you <malay>minum melampau</malay> [ah] basically
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause <malay>kalau kau minum banyak</malay> [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
<malay>kau punya badan</malay> is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you <malay>biasakan</malay> with more water then the more likely you will
<malay>kenakan</malay> the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
<malay>ni semua kena belajar</malay> [ah]
(mm) <malay>yang tepat</malay> [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but I've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you as you saying
(uh) I would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>biji</malay> [ah] <malay>biji</malay>
<malay>biji-biji kecil</malay> [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
I think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the <malay>biji</malay> take out then you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> but but then
<malay>bila kau minum</malay> [kan]
then is the texture smooth
<malay>kalau</malay>
[oh] do you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> [ah]
ya ya correct correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya I would say that [lah]
ya
but <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>kau kena</malay> like see first [lah] whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before <malay>kau tambah</malay> extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend
[ah]
(mm) true true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
with the sugar level already <malay>dah cukup</malay> already
<malay>tak payah tambah</malay> extra stuff
(um)
but as for
(err) grapefruit
(uh) those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit [ah]
ya
so be smooth [ah]
sorry grape
[ah] <malay>lain</malay>
ya different different
(err) grapefruit is <malay>besar sikit</malay>
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
<malay>sama sama</malay> ya
ya it's (uh) <malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
<malay>nama sama tapi</malay>
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut [ah]
(mm)
ya but <malay>kau kena potong</malay> [ah] before you put <malay>dalam</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> blender

because the last year the whole year is me just working my ass off like everyday you know when back in two thousand nineteen I was still a student [eh] ya I was still a student then
(err) I have my student life which is very interesting
I
(um) I involved in so many social program clubs and all
<malay>main sukan</malay> [lah] <malay>berdebat</malay> [lah] <malay>apa semua</malay> [kan] so it was very interesting life
then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
interesting as well because I have my own money [kan] very interesting <malay>tapi</malay>
it comes with costs [lah] which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight then
come back at home like for six and then at ten <malay>dah kelat sebab penat</malay> and that is very non healthy lifestyle for me [lah] so in twenty twenty one my resolution is to have
(err) more me time
no no that's not the I want some me time <malay>yang</malay> can benefit myself as well <malay>bukan macam</malay> me time just leisure time <malay>lepak-lepak tak ada tak ada</malay>
[ah] I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time [ah]
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that [ah]
I want to enroll in piano class
[a'ah] <malay>betul dulu ingatkan abah</malay> [kan] <malay>main</malay> guitar [kan] then <malay>semua anak-anak abah ni</malay> [kan] <malay>angah sorang</malay> [jer] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>ada keinginan nak main</malay> guitar <malay>kecil-kecil dulu</malay> [kan]
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not [lah] not to be like professional guitarist [lah] no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was (err) in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard [ah] and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
so I yes <malay>darjah darjah enam kat kedah dulu</malay>
(mm) (mmhmm)

but I still I still like to play guitar actually I feel
(uh) I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>menarik</malay> [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay>

something <malay>yang dah ada</malay> base [eh]
<malay>ada satu yang angah teringin nak</malay> (err) enroll in mandarin class [a'ah] I don't know [ah] I think I really I really have strong interest in language
[oh] is it I don't know about that but
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin (err) is my choice right now because
(um)
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them
(err) instead of english
(mm) (mm)
this is good for my networking [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(err) and
I remember that
(err) I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
(err) sadly only one language is (err) permissible for for for a student (err) we can only choose one additional language to learn
japanese [a'ah]
malay english arabic japanese korea
drama and also movies and songs I think that sometimes I can even understand why the actors are saying without me reading the subtitles yes
means really
(mmhmm)
so when mandarin comes it will be six !wow! (mmhmm)
<malay>apa dia</malay> [a'ah]

(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
and one more thing I think <malay>macam macam kak long kata</malay> [lah] <malay>belum kaya lagi</malay> [kan] but in the process in the journey <malay>sepanjang-panjang nak jadi kaya tu</malay>
you actually contribute a lot to the society (mm) from the the fundraising that you made or <malay>daripada</malay> the job that you created for other people
you know those small small things actually <malay>walaupun tak kaya</malay> but it means a lot [kan]
(mm) (mm)
what
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
[a'ah]
and explore
so as someone who has been in business for quite a while
what is your advice for a startup <malay>macam angah</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
it will come soon not too long #inshallah#
<malay>tapi cakap pasal</malay> start up <malay>tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>sampai sekarang tak puas hati lagi</malay> [tau]
#han ji pyeong# <malay>patut jadi</malay> hero
[ah]
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
[kan]
<malay>pasal dia dah</malay> bring the character <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm) (mm)
that's true
yes
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>tu tapi</malay> #nam do san# <malay>tu</malay> !hais! <malay>geram</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tengok</malay>
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>cuma jadi kaya</malay>
<malay>ada kereta juga</malay>
(um) <malay>ni macam</malay> very small small small thing <malay>tapi</malay> important [lah]
[kan]
<malay>tak nak</malay> procrastinate [ah]
[kan] <malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi</malay> <malay>faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh</malay> [ha] #hapo# <malay>pun takde</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay> (err) and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better <malay>faham ke macam</malay> like very last minute <malay>tapi</malay> it push us to to make a better thing <malay>faham ke</malay> ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard [lah] actually <malay>faham ke sebab</malay> ya maybe maybe
so <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> deadline [kan] deadline is twentieth october [lah] <malay>konon</malay> [kan] but the boss want to see the progress <malay>bukannya</malay> on twenty nine <malay>tu</malay> I can do everything <malay>faham ke</malay>
yes <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya I think
for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
(hmm) <malay>tapi susah</malay> [lah]
<malay>sekali</malay>
(uh huh)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya (mm) [kan]
the the algorithm <malay>dia</malay> (mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>tapi kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] <malay>bukan kita sebut</malay> [tau] <malay>benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>pelik</malay> [kan] <malay>angah rasa dia tanam</malay> chip [lah]

ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>dapur cik macam mana</malay>
(mm) (mm)
live okay <malay>lagi ni</malay> some people (err) even make like house tour #kot#
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me [lah] maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house <malay>faham ke</malay>
which is supposed to be secret but you expose publicly like for what
(mm) (mm)
