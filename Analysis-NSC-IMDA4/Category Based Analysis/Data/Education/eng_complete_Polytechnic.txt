mm
mm right right
then like
what what you study over there ah like in Australia
uh uh
mm
ya ya alright
me what school
now I in ah
Singapore Poly ah that's
mm
so like okay so
err for like my third year kan
need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job ah
so like
ya that's why ah cannot ah you know
for me I don't know ah we usually we like homesick ah you know so I go
on overseas
ah
uh I haven't pick yet ah any yet
club activities kan so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
mm
ya
mm
okay ah I find floorball quite interesting ah like
but like honestly it's not something I like ah as a sport ah you know if
uh sports ah I will definitely choose something else ah
maybe like okay so for they got clubs ah
okay so you know got different schools right
then you got my school lah called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs ah
so my one is uh club
uh interview eh um when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply kan then I went for the interview
ah that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like walao eh
ah
ya that's why
ah that's why mm
ya ya true ah it's okay lah
sports
clubs ah I think clubs can ah but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can ah so possible
kay
so like for you kan Nads</P2
your school what what course you take ah for you I know you are in year one but what course ah
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
then what are the modules you will like learn
mmhmm
mmhmm okay
ah
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me lah cause I got experience in secondary school kan
ah like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is uh about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A ah you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun ah for me
really enjoy ah cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun lah
ya
ya
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three ah is where like the interesting part lah
cause no no no before the internship kan
what ah the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine uh fuel system you know so like for us uh students right before we go for internship right you must understand ah all these kind of uh machinery how it works
cause if we just go for uh what ah
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills ah before our internship
oh what also ah
oh ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this mm
eh they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
uh
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like uh as the water level rises so it's about five minutes ah it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise lah but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast ah ya
ya
ya that's why
that test ah honestly I haven't experienced yet ah cause I only year two now ah but something I look forward to ah
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or err what you call the inspector lah so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into lah like that ah ya
ya hopefully ah mmhmm
not bad ah not bad ah
spend a lot of time playing game ah
oo shiok ah I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
mm so something ah
something to kill time also ah in secondary school you know
then for you eh your free time what you normally do ah
mmhmm
mm ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you eh cause like you know you are like
uh year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit ah
mm
mmhmm
oo
mm
so okay ah based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first ah cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see lah which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it

for me ah I also procrastinate lah like you know I prioritize my err playing games over doing work ah my assignments ah
very close right then I'll start doing ah
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time ah you know because if
kan like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me what so I obviously have to start on doing ah
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over ah then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it ah you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle ah this issue of procrastination cause like
always ah since secondary school ah
always prioritise my games over the
mm wah
damn
ya it is hard lah but you know we must lah you know
it's very hard lah then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
ya group projects like that
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
wah
mm
mm
okay
me ah okay I have ah okay recently
social innovation project ah uh ya
I think combined with
uh different types of uh people from different courses ah so like
uh
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry ah
so equips you with this kind of skill lah but let me tell you something ah I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you ah
cause like err it's damn rabak I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like walao eh why why got so much workload ah ah I don't want do ah like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
ah
like this
ya
ah then okay okay this one ah it happen like
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal ah for our presentation slides
then these guys right
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate ah
then
oh then they say eh why like that we you the only malay just come lah then I say how can like that I holiday what hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
oh my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining ah keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
or like do some drawing design kan
ah alamak legit I tell you I don't want ah but it's okay lah
ya but overall I think it's a good experience lah
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together ah
and also ya it's good lah so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made uh okay you know for our project our aim right
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely kan
ah they are like damn lonely right
alamak why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use ah then we decided to come up with something interesting for them lah cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
uh our the depression app ah counter
Pikachu ah Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
kay so what's so special about this tab right
uh when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app kan they can uh what ah uh
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say uh how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
mm it's it's quite cool lah honestly
and also err
you can also prompt for
uh real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one uh what uh questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool lah ya
ya um and also for our app right uh we also put what ah
uh since like most of us like like to game ah like we
most um people like to game like they download apps for what
uh games right
for most people right then
ah our app introduces like some mini short games ah so you got heard of uh what kind of games ah err like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
ah Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games ah like also we put uh animal crossing ah concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
um
games for the user to play with ah which makes our app interesting ah
ya a lot of people ah
mm
ya so our app
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
ah
what ramen or some like cookie eh
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon ah which is I think quite cool ah so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to ah ya
forward to ya
so that's about it ah for my module interesting ah
mmhmm
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong uh
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two ah
ya semester two ah
it's called err
ah communicative I can't remember ah what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
uh improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach ah like one of them is ah time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance ah it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right kan do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what ah
what's that ah
oh your interview skills ah
for interview
he teach us uh the basic questionnaire ah like how to prep ourselves for interview
err what should we ask during an interview you know how to properly answer an interview
so I think is quite that one ah manageable
ah
ya
ya
so I respect ah for doing that
y'know
like I always stutter you know but like how in the future how are you gonna present yourself like why why would the company want to pick you over other people kan
so you have to present yourself better
so which is what this module is teaching ah
how to how to out
outstand ah among the other other interviewees ah
ya
so it's quite good lah since

no ah it's considered but for a start it's considered a lot
but for
my for like my course is not a lot my course uh starting for diploma is three point two
ya that's why it's so damn hard
yes
that's considered a lot ah like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay lah enough what
no five K one person
but that's not bad what you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay ah
I think something right starting another business sia
like six eh seven to three jer
so it's not like very long hours
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall
is four K you know
ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K
ya then like
but
earn a lot but you say the expansion though she cannot wait for one shop she open
fusion
eww
eh actually can try sia if it's nice
at where
oh really
wow
one day I should try also maybe we should go
I
ya but I think they are not earning that much as that last time with her friend
for that shop
ya I mean but I don't think can even earn twelve K though
they are at home what
that's why they
same
don't let you what
around in singapore
oh
like if they if their bike screech or something then I fall then after that I go inside hospital
uh ya ya
okay

okay lah all's good all is good so
how
um
err for me
I guess is like
okay lah lesser
customers
but
so it's so hard for people to no be able to listen then it's like I try to raise my voice but then I feel like
so how other than
work how else is the pandemic
ya lah rilek ah okay water break
but ya I think uh one of my pet peeves I guess is
kan like what's the point bro you sneeze from your nose not from your mouth so you cover your mouth for what
and
mm
you know
so it's just just from her face
like a gangster seh but then
okay uh were there other people that felt the same way as you
um
um
um
ah so like two face
just marker
I think uh
because
you know for what ya so so it's just like
maybe
some of them are okay jer
but it's just you know it's just a stupid reason for me to just like ah
ya it does
ya ya ya ya
ya but but this is why I guess
we
as millennials I guess or gen Z or whatever okay you you millennial right because you are older
ya but
because we we put ourselves online
you know even especially this recording is also online ya so
ya precisely
actually is good for you to hide yourself like you know on social media especially
um if you do want to
go on dating apps
I suggest you can use a different name
well technically but like at least is still obvious right
okay that one K K K okay that one case lah but like ya that one that one is like but ya I got see a lot of people
on Tinder also oh okay say they put in their bio like
hi I'm actually seventeen or like fifteen then I I just straight away report they just fake their birthday lah but straight away we report lah because it's like
just imagine if
um a police read or something for some reason and then it's like they ask oh why you talking to a minor and then just like
I feel like we doing podcast but ya well
um
for example you are from a royal family or something or you are someone very very important you know ah ya sia but then ya it depends on the situation but
ya
you going to get bitten
um
Maggi Maggi cup jer
which one is it the indomie one
karma wow
I wonder what they serve
trauma in karma
but then I heard uh
okay lah I just google lah just now they have no menu so how ah
I feel like
it will be a full course meal starting from
starters appetiser and then all the way until dessert
sorry I never go restaurant before but
ya either way ya it's like the seven levels of hell basically I feel like
ya
but ya if if karma were to serve me something right it will be
revenge I feel like
from
lek ah lek lek lek lek lek
uh it's just
because back then in school ah now I working full-time already lah ah so
uh I made a lot of enemies because somehow some way people just don't like me and is like is like some kind of an algorithm
for at the end at the end of every school year right I will lose all my friends
ya ya well I don't know if I lose to them or they lose to me lah but
either way is this
ya I still remember one occasion
ah secondary school
but ya because like oh my god first major exam so like you expect people to at least
just
but then well ah long story short
it's just a
when I
that night where err
whether now so
you know like those kind err high school sweetheart kind of thing it's a no from me
oh shit okay no no
and then
ya so after that
uh so I guess on that night we just decided to be together to be in a relationship not me and my best friend my and the guy so
so somehow right the next day
his girlfriend is me then I was like who sia who spread and then obviously the first person that I suspected was not even my best friend you know that was how much I love her I want to say like but that sounded a bit
ya but then then ah
um before me and the guy
err talk right
he like another girl and
ya so
ya secondary school anything can happen so
err I talk to my best friend lah and say like oh why who who do you think spread and everything then she like ah I don't know you know everything then I was like ya true I also don't know because the thing is that I somehow I was too dumb to realise that she was also in that call yesterday lah like I didn't remember that fact
you know and then
ya that's true sia
that's why okay that's why you know the phrase where
some some people do say that oh I prefer befriending those on ya ya ya
some of them is like that because they will act like everything is just like oh hi let me ask guy best friend first
some of you all you just don't try to act innocent when you're not lah
ya
but
but that's why for me is that I prefer
how do you ah say I prefer
um
ya ya ya ya ya
um
ya but ah I got I got those kind of friend before I just drop
ya
eh ya I want off topic sia but okay your turn your turn I I go I go back jurong lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
example
check out rhythm skins in latin
who knows
ya but
ya I guess karma is technically revenge lah but not from the person itself but it's just from the world
ya mmhmm thanks
ya I guess um
if okay if you okay for example if you were the restaurant yourself if you were karma yourself what would you do
for supper
not for yourself lah not so bad lah for for anybody that you feel like
I guess
okay
mmhmm
in what sense
oh bro is is he living up to the quote of like every great woman is there's a great man behind or something I know it's the opposite lah but
but let's say
ah then that means
dude
do you feel like they are insecure of themselves when they say that kan um
um
um
mmhmm
ah ya my ex also did that
um
to a certain extent
or snobbish also
exactly in twenty twenty please get therapy
ya
even
okay this one I cannot brain
women also the same what
I guess in a sense
um um
ya because I feel like we
we don't have to mansplain stuff
right is that the word
so we okay if we say that oh my god I was
I don't know ya it's just a bit only not asking for much
I the self-proclaimed resting bitch face basically
ya like very edgy in a sense
no lah you normal lah
yes
but then for her is just
it was very hard to try to make her open up as in not open up to her secrets or whatever it's just talk to me like a normal person that's it and then it came to the point where she became clingy at first for me I I she said that I was clingy because I was trying too hard to become her friend but then I was like
err
and then after that
and then like oh how I wish I was in your group then I say oh ya same how I wish I and my friend were in my group but at that point of time I already started this liking because the way she was being very possessive and jealous over me even though we were just friends ya
um ya precisely unless you're married lah that one I think
a bit can
it's
ya
okay we're just single lah that's why we talk about this
ya but maybe for me is just I don't like the way you text so bye bye
so okay I I got I always ask this question if if you had three wishes
what
will you do with it I mean what would you wish for lah you know you know like those eleven eleven kind of thing
true I agree
so okay if everything was free how will you obtain those materials
forming oh farming how do you farm an iphone
ya how
what
okay she she living in thirty thirty one can farm an iphone
well I guess but we need a lot of land though singapore don't have a lot of land how ah
get a rooftop
then for the next wish okay other than the first wish will be everything will be free second
oh
wish
so explain your comfort characters um
ya anime anime ya
can you imagine he just pop up and just answer you
I see okay so
maybe you should manifest some cash
okay so what what
okay so secondary wish is your comfort characters third wish
oh that's cute
okay if if your cats were to talk right okay for all your cats that you have
how would you
how how do think they will they will talk to you for example gizmo
what do you do
give them a character ya ya ya ya ya
okay then your other cats
do you think she will be like the queen bee of the school
okay ya got some people just like that like
ya some some people are just naturally very attractive but
ya they very nice
ya maybe she'll be like what your big sister kind of character that will be cute
am I I I I guess maybe
and then okay your other cats
you live with them what that's why I'm asking you
oh that's cute alah
oh damn
I see okay I see
mmhmm
what
ya
okay lah makes sense mmhmm
something like a lot of
but is a cat a lost kitty
ah
ah okay lah at least um
dear you still have gizmo I know you you sure gizmo a lot
and and and
mmhmm ya ya her name is baby
damn okay
ah okay how how you take a cat home
in the carrier wow the love ya
ah
cute
so does she give more or does she want more attention
ah kan
no you you can have more cats than you know than more boyfriends so
and it's and it's and it's socially acceptable
okay what at least you're not spending money on someone who who can cheat you know which cat would cheat on you
right most to most is just get fat that's it
it's fine I can always you know help you
ya get
get I don't know get scratched I guess no the thing is I like cats but
sometimes I'm afraid to approach them
I mean you live with them
ah
how then the cat never fight back
ah that's true trust on trust
yes if you don't trust there's nothing nothing will happen so many things
ah that's true true like if animals were to like you except for insects
no thanks that one a bit sus
no we got a problem officer
so okay between cats and dogs
okay
I was thinking of something but okay thanks
why in what sense
that's
oh
um
mmhmm
okay that that makes sense but you know about the law where they they are forbidding people from having cats in
ya ya but demonising but ya it's just I feel like it's unfair because
for from my perspective right cats
they are cleaner and they are they make less noise the most to most they are meows are just very soft
when they run around
damn okay
so so animals are like that also okay
ya
ya sial ah who who ask you ghost
ya
but
ya I got around my neighbourhood if I do see the big dogs they are fine they are chill it's just the small dogs I don't know for some reason they just want to approach you like don't don't
ya
glass panel
is the one at the door right the gate right
specific eh
because you angry
what why wah so specific what you do sia
ya
ah mmhmm
uh huh
I don't I don't understand sia like I feel like they they have some kind of hate or anger inside them to the point where they can just hate so much
okay ya that's right
but but if you are below one five zero that one is a different kind of temper honestly
serious
ya because it's all compressed
ya it's all compressed so if you are ya if you are power
ya that's all the short guys don't date short guys
from experience maybe it's just a stereotype please don't take this too hard
well okay
I wish I had a cat
but I feel like
I don't know I'll be so emotionally attached to it
I don't know I I emotionally attached to a lot of things for example my water bottle or whatever is it can be quite toxic ya mmhmm don't make me sound so old please
so so it's like
nah I'm not single I'm I'm I'm single but not ready to mingle okay but
but ya ya I think I'm those kind of grandmothers I think like with the family heirloom that I just I just pass pass down my granddaughter my bottle that she cannot do anything about it she sell also people will just realise it's just a normal bottle that's not much value
well gen gen Z gen zentiment
okay lah I guess ya that would be our labels from society right like gen Z and just ah strawberry generation lah all those kind of shit
but things are done what
like everyone is struggling in their own things it's I don't know
yes
yes
precisely
of course they can lah the competition not that much
ya
mmhmm
ya
I I agree but because because it's true because I mean everyone is facing the same thing no matter how how much of
how much pressure that are getting lah so very little or what I mean I feel like
the future generations will also feel more pressure because there will be
too many things happening at once especially the pandemic now like
are home based learning okay lah a lot of people struggling especially those who
are either starting their first year of like you know or poly just ah tertiary education or like even
on their last year of school
it's just like
it's a very ah ya I don't know what to do kind of thing
content morning but game is a
um
so it what it's saturday sunday just
ya I mean for school I understand but for work
uh huh so so
by monday to friday so she had like rush it through and
damn
I'm just amazed at the fact that okay I mean sure working throughout the weekend but who has a meeting at ten until one okay maybe makes sense because timezone ya
but still
ya
well
okay other than school
but I feel like ya well
we all trying our best lor so
you know they were like like what you said just now like oh I did back in my days it was easier and then like now is just like there's so much competition there's so much you know if you want to study for example nursing a lot of people are taking nursing now because of the pandemic and then ah you know like now even the tourism industry is just basically dead
you know like err ya and then like it's it's just sad because
so much time wasted so many people getting retrenched and everything
I mean at least we get to you know some of us maybe we are from like
ah from our business background then we go into like
medical background or like vice versa you know that works also
but I don't know how it will play out after
how many years lah I feel like
it will stay for quite long
getting
no no it's just about the world we we never mention any ya
ya but but also like culture wise you know like I feel like there's still this thing about tattoos and going around
ya and I thought that you know at work it was like some kind of offense you know with the law that oh you cannot have tattoos but then when I ask around is just is just the culture
or any kind of physical ah body modifications I was about to say mutilations
ya but
it's nice oh especially it's just weird that
you know if you go to poly university can colour your hair you can do whatever but then like
ya brown dark brown
slightly dark
ya but hmm that's it
it's just chicken that has been un-raw
ya
I mean it's not it's it won't affect
you know it's just
ya
ya and it's as long as you do your work you do your part that's fine you don't have to like oh because she got she got tattoo lah he he got piercings ah you know he got piercings on the eyebrow and then just like how is that distract you you just don't look ya that's it
ya but I just hope
how to say I guess our generation we have things to look out for right
ya
ya and hopefully all the other things happening will be great lah right right

right
yup
how old is your daughter now
oh my god you see
you see
it's ah it's he's a it's
he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that I've not seen you
and the the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
yes we just performed our buttocks off ya and you remembered in her house there was like there's there's like
a mini stage where she you know it was in like her I don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
ya lots of memories there but very err blur
vague
cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's err
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me lah
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
in front of people
and then after that the
so
ya ya you were you were it
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay lah the word is forget ladies and gentlemen um
manufacturing
right no no no continue no no no ya
this was another traumatising part err on my end
I guess so ya I guess so
oh ya ah we were kids we were
just stop lah like whoa
ya but you know
right
hmm oh my god
forced that's the word
you know what I felt the same way about you
and
what
oh my god I remembered
right
right mmhmm
mmhmm
we ya
I remembered
then we were doing oh and you know ya that was
we were very very happy
right
oh ya
but
yes I remember that part also and another thing which I also remember was that err
brother john
no
love
brother brother love
mmhmm
ya eh same ah
right
okay
you
I mean you are very positive
what
right right right right right I I feel that I feel that you are trying not to raise up that that that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya I err
yes err I mean my mum is quite
fat and I love her and my dad loves her very much you know err ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time
mmhmm okay err I remembered when we we went to primary school together right we went to xishan primary school together which is in yishun

warning sign ah
the connection still
so yup

your father because I think we did have this conversation
err at one point of time
oh ya ya ya my dad also lah my dad also speaks english
like around my dad's age ah
as in to to do his exercises right
and he will do the the simple exercises with the stretches no I I did introduce him to yoga but I I don't think he's interested in that
ya he starts to like cycle so
like I'm actually happy for him you know because
I guess I mean
ya so um um he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years lah
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
ya
ya
not say active lah like I am not interested in the whole thing I I I don't know maybe because I'm like you know I like it's weird because okay
I don't get my information from there I go to the news I direct news and all this
so I don't and as as you know I'm quite introvert also
am I ya I think so ya I'm quite introvert ya so ya because ya I I rather you know
I rather be alone

no worries

shah rukh khan uh and then uh what's that some of the bollywood's
uh actors and actresses

uh the fee ah to go to go inside
and dive together swim together with the fish

ah both of you can what was that I can put on uh scuba diving uh I think I just
if you can really swim together with the sharks eh

that time you watch what what movie
at the bedok cinema
you cried
ah movie

oh japanese story but they what they voice into what
orh the subtitle orh how how many viewers

ah
but then quite a sad story ah I I don't wish to watch that kind of story ah
uh can watch lah old people cannot watch lah
why why why not they um
uh what was that revive uh superman's life eh
if a old time uh superman eh I think I will watch ah
I I I I prefer superman other than any other Marvel
ah heroes ah
uh what was that uh superman uh
powerful character ah compared to other marvel heroes ah
mm
hulk also
eh
ah right
ah ah
so last time when I watch hulk eh last time eh uh series eh they no no no nothing
ah there was actual visual
I like uh I like the the series very much ah those days ah
superman uh hulk

really accept so much lah we prefer normal
I mean natural visuals ah
mm
ah sorry
okay lah I I also appreciate uh movies lah
those time also I watch true lies
uh what's that uh movies rambo also
uh but
arnold schwarzenegger uh rambo

uh I think these movies really make my day ah
and ah for me I like adventurous and not so violence ah
I like adventurous ah and then also
I like to watch fairy tales movie
uh as well like cinderella
snow white
uh I think
uh I I prefer to watch this this kind of fairy tales ah
uh
ah should be no problem ah kan
uh I I think uh
ah we can go there what
ah
I can try baby pool first ah
or you can try deep pool also what
ah I I I think I think we can try ah swimming
you can try your skills
no it's it's quite uh no uh wasted tau
if you you know how to swim you better use use your skills
correct not so this time round you can use the deep pool don't worry lah maybe can we we we we can try slowly
alright then after that you can uh sharpen up your your your your swimming your swimming skills
then after that we can go east coast
ah
so east coast you were to go deeper or you want to go to the shallow
uh and then how how uh and then how you get how you got the way how you run away
he carried you ah okay lah so so
oh but then
uh you sounded not okay lah but then end end up okay ah
okay lah should be no problem lah
so so so hopefully so uh you what's that in sec one sec two you you had
uh several
uh practices kan ah I think should be should be okay
ah
practice
ah
ah
so if you go to east coast maybe we can take a shallow one ah
ah slowly
ah so gradually we can we can really do lah correct or not
I mean it's a waste ah
you can uh we will just we we we we send you to go swimming
uh swimming courses and then after that end up
you cannot swim I mean you are afraid to swim ah
ah
bedok swimming pool
ah pity ya actually actually I want to try also
how to swim also
uh
it's not I'm scary it's not I I'm I'm too scared ah actually I also can practise also
ah
so so so I I I think I can I can practise if I practise I can better become better than you ah
ah
so be beside swimming what's your what's your other fear ah height height is it
oh okay
okay okay
even though it took uh long longer time for you to to complete the course
did someone help you along

so ya because like I I wanted to go uni right but I didn't get in so I will try next year but for now like I need to find a job so is quite difficult lah because of the pandemic also it's like uh it's like very limited with the jobs so hmm
oh ah cashier job
oh that no that one temporary I mean they did ask me to extend lah but I it's not something that I want to do for like a long term you get what I mean ya ya cause like cause I work you know at there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you lah your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like ah we got we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so I think it's ya no no no it's uh like uh for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
ya so that's why I'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right oh really ah
as in she working oh
oh
ya eh she working as cashier also ah mm
um I think I got make like a few mistakes lah once because I was just new what then I like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then ah you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then I got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money lah I mean ya then after that uh the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so I guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya lah we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need lah ya but so far never ah
oh ya got this one point of time when I was just new then like I was doing with the aunty lah so apparently like I think I miscalculated leh then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because I think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well I I was supposed to pay ah cause I think I was the one that did the mistake lah then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so I felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya I think it depends on the outlet lah
ya
oh my god
ah so nice luckily the uncle
so ya I don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what lah but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
ah pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive lah also but also some of the customers like I think ah some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay lah the one that time cause I work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much ah eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen sia imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what wah that one is like is like one week pay leh
oh ya okay I wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name fadreena is it fadreena so you met her from right the try out
hmm
oh no okay wait so my friend ah I don't know if you know her lah is she's the one that wear the hijabi she I mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend lah
so apparently she and the fadreena they are in the same course I believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates lah so apparently uh my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then after that the few the next few days kan um the fadreena was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
then like ah the japan trip also like she was the fadreena was like very like I don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because I think also fadreena like I don't think you know her much lah but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time I think they were like making fun of each other lah fadreena and my friend then because ah then like she they I mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say uh I forgot what ah
very bad from then then ah oh ya recently cause that time I met with her so the my friend naziha right she said like the fadreena sent her a long long text
saying like um what ah why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago mah
so from then my from then on right my friend never talk to her because like obviously like they can they cannot click right so why would she talk to her right so ya and then suddenly like very recently she ask she just sent that long text ah of like why you talk behind my back then my friend also like huh I also never talk behind your back for what then also because she got like a boyfriend right I think I don't know is
ya
ya I mean like I don't know like so pretentious the vibe

like I think she he cannot move on from her lah then the ex also is like now quite successful already so he's uh working under certis cisco then his pay quite good lah from what I see
then he say like I have everything now but I don't have you so like the only thing that I'm I need is you then my friend also like uh like contemplating lah cause like she when she was with her ex for like two years when he was in so now she has to start back from square one
hmm ya
mm ya ya ya
mm
ya
ya
ya true
no cause like uh I mean she likes the guy currently lah I mean she really loves him from what she say but because the guy also must like I don't know why but she she keeps comparing the current with the ex like the way they were in well when they were in lah so like apparently the current one right now is not giving like uh how to say ah like
uh my friend right she gave a lot the guy like as in like efforts lah not not as in like um money or what but like giving like effort like making handwritten letters and all that and then um buying him chocolates and all then but then um the guy never really like

then also the guy also like um doesn't like he doesn't really spend much on her I mean even though he's lah but like most of the meals right she have to pay for herself ya so that's why she feel like mm like meh ya

oh last night my friend
video called me until until so late
my two guy friends one of them
uh no the the guy the one in the girlfriend
called with us ah but he himself is not there
so the three of us
video called without him for the surprise
uh yeah
ya lah
it's a surprise it's called a surprise
so uh we we got plan A and plan B
I mean I mean
of course have to come up with a solid plan right
no plan A uh plan A we go we go Sentosa
the beach lah
come as a surprise
yes I think it'll be fine
why ah
why sia
so weird
no so go Sentosa uh we come with a cake and some light snack I think like Pezzo eh
then ya
then uh we get this combo
you know that now they are promoting tourist stuff for Singaporeans right
yeah so there's packages that you can visit different places
yeah so we we are we are going we are going for this package which which is like uh forty two dollars
or go
uh the wax museum
Tussauds
ya I think it's that one
uh the wax museum some Marvel
some Marvel
dah that's one for one you know means we can split into two lah
ya so split into two uh
one for one so two lah
yes
yeah
then uh that that wax museum uh
uh later ah but basically
basically uh those are our activities lah for the day
yeah then
after that uh they want to eat at satay by the bay is it
I've never been there my entire life
yeah
uh
no I know where it is I know
I know where it is but I've never been there to eat
no it's like a hawker centre
but very
the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
mm
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
uh plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set uh we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage uh
we set up like a small
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage meh I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
ya
because there were other people lah that's the best we could find actually
obviously lah everyone will aim for that spot got shade what
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus ah this is our plan B
um
but I say that will be very suspicious
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya lah like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
uh on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
eh or is it more than two I don't know lah but
long enough lah
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor ah then I said okay then another if if let's say
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot ah
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
but
then I'm like he cannot lah
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
but but
okay I'm okay no okay oh wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late oh yes I remember the deciding factor
yeah
weekday cannot lah he what
then
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
it's not really
I know got Shah Rukh Khan
you've been with me at Hong Kong
what I say just now
no then like oh yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
say he don't want to go for class ah he skip that week's class
yeah
then I but I told her lah uh whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class lah it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
if he
Tampines ah
I think ah
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back Tampines he don't like to go back that house
no lah but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near Tampines hub there
so
no
near Tampines hub
yeah
yeah but ya lah he he likes
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
attraction in Sentosa
yeah
six last eh entry eh something like that
ya lah which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
err it's very he
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay jer
yeah
I give my opinions but you know uh eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend lah cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
food lah estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock ah I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them ah
I was telling them uh I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah
eh but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
uh they sell their specialty is what ah
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing lah okay
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay lah just go with the flow if cannot then cannot lah
we can just like
but like
very light food lah
cannot eat cannot eat I okay jer
um
hmm
uh eh mm
that that that that's a
that's a good
then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan lah
um
then we talk about like other things lah
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
yeah
that's what she say ah
I do a lot of things so
I'm like uh I think FaceTime better ah but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
Arshad
one big group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah lah you know
those people
no those people lah
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
oh the thing is uh out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
yeah yeah
then
ya then ya lah
so but then we
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
then I'm like no ah don't let me be the deciding factor ah
mm ya true so
now now I'm just like okay go ahead lah
it's okay
then I say lah anyway
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
uh I mean huh I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy lah but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with Humaira and marissa
yeah I realised that uh I enjoy going out with
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends lah I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also what
ya you see like like Ria
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
mm
it's okay lah
I mean yeah they go see they are going they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know ah
so sad leh is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell what
no it's because I went there prominent lah
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
err towards the end towards the end ya lah third year
okay lah uh
I sorry ah but ya lah that's the difference between you and me lah I enjoy pe
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
uh red one not blue
dangling I want to tho
hhmm
waste money sia go in take photo
ya lah the vintage car
oh yes
oh ya I remember eating that with Humaira
I remember you were pregnant lah last time when you go with me
crazy
I know
no it wasn't
it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part lah
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride lah so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop what
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
uh
I got somemore drawing to do
oh ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
what was her email ah
need to find her email
mm
ya
ya lah anyway
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about uh how
we were saying lah we know we know the process of how he met her right
so found her Instagram
and then
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line lah I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya he knows what he wants ah that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya err also because he knows himself better lah learnt from mistakes
he will take action
huh
I think a bit lah he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it lah
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling lah
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
mm
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what eh what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you uh it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage ah
yeah but you already bloomed dah
some someone lah
yes
ya
really
oh my god you all nerds

drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
off the damn switch lah why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
the sharp edges

so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly

mm
mm insecurities
mm
mm
uh huh
mm
mm
okay like for you do you think beauty
beauty in the long term would you ya would you for example would you friend someone who is okay because for beauty some people define it as good looks but then good looks to me uh I I see as a short term thing
ya ya ya
ya okay so my question is like do you think um
would you would you go for that beauty in the short term basis or a long term basis
um
okay
mmhmm

ten years down the road ya
mm true true

competition
oh okay
mmhmm
oh ya
um okay
uh for working life eh
I think
it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then I think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
I don't know like I don't really place any priority in beauty
ya mmhmm
err yes yes
ya ya
mmhmm
mm
um
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
uh
okay like I think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
err yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
first time impression or
ah okay
mm
mmhmm
okay
uh I think will be mindset slash personality wise
uh okay okay
don't have good personality or mindset then
ya like what's the point of the marriage ya
um intelligence

ya that
I hate
uh
mm
ya okay the
uh
okay no before
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
mm
mm
subjective lah also
mm
mm
practical they're quite practical
is
uh ya
comparing ya mm
ya better
mm ya should we move on
mm
beauty standards is it
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
mm
yes
mm suicide
oo
mm
mm
ya I think uh
err yes yes
uh yes
mmhmm yes
uh if there's a term
uh if I'm not wrong the term is dysfunctional um
ya dysfunctional um um ya so it's basically like the society is not
uh it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the uh beauty standards or the socioeconomic status is not
so I think ya
yes yes any ya any competition also
ya yes yes yes
ya I'm not really sure what's the term lah but ya
mm
mm
ya ya
any any drive to move forward

to to emphasize to place the emphasis on your own life and and what you are you want to achieve in this world and the world after instead of looking what and not be influenced heavily by your surroundings so
it's really it's really what
your heart and your what what you really want lah instead of doing something that the the people around you
yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
mm
so ya
ellen degeneres
mm true true
mm
mm
mm
yes
ya okay then we shall end this recording here
alright thank you

well if I have
three wishes kan
um the firstly lah I
I would like to become a millionaire
oh ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just um
okay how many options just ah one or two or three
not that good
meal eh
oh overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique lah
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best eh
to that extreme yes
ah
no the wagyu beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
itaewon the itaewon actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain ah it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up err that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the bulgogi is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the bulgogi
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal lah I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is lah
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and wah I tell you the
okay in japan kan in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of lah
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive lah but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school lah cause err frankly speaking in asia right
really far kan
ah so that is the gist lah actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept err alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting kan that's what I when if you go around the world then you see lah
mm
correct correct correct is like that one
uh so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
ah so that is the gist lah
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy ah but again lah like
into youtube kan
ah yes cause garlic is very good lah basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy eh I
healthy
fruits lah I eat fruits lah but uh if you want it
okay ah usually fruits lah I just eat fruits
oh almost everyday is egg lah by right egg is is considered healthy food mah
skills eh meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code lah code very very well so that I can build
err games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product ah after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
uh one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause uh again ah
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again uh it's all about the skill set ah if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food ah
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep lah and also very err
they have very rich history uh their okinawan
karate-do aikido
if you're late for one minute eh they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right okinawa the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
kata it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
ah that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use uh a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really ah do research on it
sorry again
was free
err
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this err
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view lah but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
oh
oh
okay ah
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
mm
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
ah cause I think that is the way to go lah you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity eh
meaning what ah
hmm ah eight hours eh
activity eh activity
activity
eight hours eh
wah
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight eh I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke lah if a comical joke easy ah double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause err my life how to say ah
it's a pretty boring lah
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya lah
actor eh err
okay ah actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
um he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one ah also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like err
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this ah
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed uh then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
ah orh even beyond that um you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that eh
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male ah character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this ah characters also this achilles
uh his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya lah and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used um can really
make if you really into this ah like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful lah I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
oh how I keep ah I don't know leh
actually I just went through life ah
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that um
after I read a book for half an hour
all these uh youtube lah especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it lah
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read one
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos lah I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right err I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something ah err you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist ah
seventeen years old eh
seventeen years
old self
ah
seventeen
need to know ah you need to give me a time period
seventeen
oh poly eh
err
advice
I don't truthfully ah I don't regret anything
advice eh okay the best thing is
ah
ah actually frankly speaking eh at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago ah and actually
ah if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine ah
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
err
things in life yet
your character back then when you
uh
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life lah
just a live my life that's all lah mm
where do I see myself eh
in five years' time eh okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same ah as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married lah so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially uh
money making invention business so basically is
the coding lah hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it wah then I'll be woo
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years

okay I'm recording now

right that's why I need
the job
sixty dollars no I cannot I I cannot I'm saving that money to book the to activate my account back like for my grab stuff E P
I mean like that is what I have been doing
I mean like it works for a little while I mean like it works like when I had
the K S P money the government money the government grant it work lah I keep my
my money all there
is like I don't think I want to show my face lah you know the korean pictures like the
should I put my phone here
I mean I don't think I want my legs
like this
I am
okay
I don't I don't want a lot of greens actually
not really like maybe like see the
or something like
I don't need to be full lah
I just wanna like because I don't have make up
ya but like
you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
is it okay duh
oh okay maybe nearer ya
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck
okay
so funny
okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
oh look like
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
oh
okay
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
but you can learn ah it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so I love it sia no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much um you edit ah
the higher your
your saturation err contrast and all that right
the worst the the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of um effect and then like the effect you put how high it is ah technically
kan and that's what my photographer friend said ah and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
oh is my card with you
okay
mm
ya same as you right
oh
eh but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take what
like if I end before eleven forty five
mm
but will that minus off like my pay
oh okay that is nice
mmhmm
it just enough time for me to take home lah
so like can I have to go back to orchard
oh oh the stop the bus
then I stop at dhoby ghaut
ah
uh huh
nice I mean at least better than Smiggle
ya why why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever whatever but they didn't even do that
I'm so tired what the shit
okay I can't wait to watch my Netflix
brams no
no no it's a it's a K drama about like classic music classical music mm
no actually K dramas ah korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right right
hmm
that's me that's me when I watch scarlet heart ryeo I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart ryeo was more than twenty episode I think
oh my god it was so good kan then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then ee
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood lah because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something ah can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad
I heard they make a chinese version of it
that is the thing
kan oh ya I saw
drama the goals are eh like meh
oh you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know ah
I think china version of meteor garden that are four

staycation thingy ticket and the chalet you get free tickets for wah wah wet
ya and I want to go wah wah wet
ya but if you book you get free sia
I don't know I think hundred plus I remembered it depends on how how big you want the room to be the small the smaller room are like hundred plus per night or something like that it's quite cheap ah actually but I feel like it's not that worth it
you didn't have like toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds

ah
ah

singaporean
ah
as time ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
or white paper right
you go in ah you going for how long how long they they ask you
singaporean
ah
independence kan independence
mm
then
ah ah ya
we got to err I mean uh
mm
my teacher
ah
ah
ya lah

okay
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on ah
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
so I say that to him lah
mm
so they were looking for people to debate lah like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
ah I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate what
so uh
err I
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
mm
seriously ah
okay
okay we don't talk about lah eh
is err
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
uh huh
ah right
that's the thing ah
even
but government allow sport activity what
ah
so I call this guy he's known for speaking ah good malay
uh to mix we always mix
ah
a'ah it's very standard ah
err okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have err
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay lah let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
oh my god
you know what
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
mm ah okay okay
so
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
something like that
ah alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my err future lah
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
ah be a professional sports player
okay
uh huh
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer lah cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
err but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
ah so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money lah
ah
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific lah but
Singapore soccer is a no no lah
all macam haziq
ah that's a bit unrealistic the passion is uh actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of err
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life lah
ah
alright
sorry
ah true true Malaysia pay better
um
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower ah
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport ah
anywhere and everywhere
wah so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late lah I don't want to be late lah
ya so for example ah
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
mm
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching ah
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about lah
ah
it is an emotional story
um sad
but
no it's a series series
mm but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
hmm
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
oh
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class ah in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well err in primary school
ah because
um
how to say eh
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no lah I mean that that's the problem ah because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have err you know
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
ah play soccer at the void deck all lah so
I will change my mindset lah but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this ah cliche phrase
it's true ah what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example ah that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like wah
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song ah kan maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
ah
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders ah basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start eh you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song ah
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because ah there was this video playing that song ah so like oh not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K ah I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
you know but I'm like oh ya eh nice song nice song ah
so it's damn annoying ah actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the lah
okay lah okay lah we cannot throw shades lah okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
mm
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
um
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries ah will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
mm
ya
precisely
mm mm mm
that's a sensitive uh topic
okay
let's see next question eh
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do mm very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds lah
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
um rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need ah okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and ah okay basically iphone is good lah those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
um shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at pasar malam
and then
shoe uh twenty thousand lah
you know ah Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
ah bought a very expensive car lah
uh so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like eh you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like oh okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money lah
you want to show off
and all
give me their money lah I can put to better use
okay oh yes sorry
mm
uh
but people just live to complicate it
ah
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face lah
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do lah right
alright next question
oh this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours oh my god
oh my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
yeah
ya so like
like they say ah everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different lah
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
so I'm like eh so there's now two shops eh
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food lah outside food the look is so important
mm mm
and
mm
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got ah
hopefully
oh you know what I just want to come lah
um next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
err oh okay okay oh okay okay
okay hmm
oh okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone eh sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
mm
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face ah
okay I wouldn't say expert because
err I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right lah
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on lah it was like what blonde
then I was like
ah see ah this one ah
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit ah
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
ah the
eh don't do this lah
you know what I mean you are like come on lah you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but kena our
you wanna get expelled is it
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
no comments
um okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
um
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
um
can ah but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is err
skill eh
maths
ah I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths ah maths ah like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of uh discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me ah
ah
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
mm
mm mm
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
yes
okay
it's good lah they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
alamak cannot search ah
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning lah
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events oh basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny lah okay we skip class
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding ah a serious scolding ah
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
ah
I mean
it's hard lah it's hard
yeah
damn but
oh my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss lah definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it lah eh let's not throw shade to people lah eh
but oh my god I miss our class with
uh ham boy
S&W
uh
you only spend time when ah
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you lah
like that we really sit down and talk
ah
ah yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was ah
ah
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time lah
ah
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
um graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay lah
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
err
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
you know what I mean
but
ah
and I have better options ah I have better prospect so
if I'm gonna go this way
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do ah to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
you know what I mean
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that what you know what I mean
like giving
so
true lah true
yeah
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free ah
cause I'm laying low a bit
ah I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things lah in the future
mm so you can actually come down
three more right
mm
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
huh
fifteen minutes fifteen ah serious expressway
mm mm mm mm mm in Singapore you wanna rev come on lah
you throttle abit beep
kena fine
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
um
let me think ah
it it seems good right
oh
I wanted to
like you know my friend buy then I get the free one lah
what happened
oh your wifi seems abit bad lah eh
okay lah I think we go next question ah it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves lah ah not to other people lah
what would you rather have
yes
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that lah this I guess this my fate lah
so if
in the past yeah fit body now ah
whatever god give me I'll take lah
like uh whatever it is lah good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again lah
like know because
ah but oh my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body lah like
we don't need upper body strength
you don't pass don't shoot eh
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying lah because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
if you look at the oppunent team eh
the best is usually the fastest
ah but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst ah offensively
ah
so
but I have to keep up with those uh because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not um
used to it ah like I'm not exposed to it what
ah
mm mm mm mm yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
for the rest of my life bro
frugal eh
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house lah because free what
right
oh chicken rice for the win bro
funny ah you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore chey
oh I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
chicken
beef
ah
kampung chicken they make sure it's from a
not say kampung lah but you know kampung means they bring it up naturally
ah it it it you don't have to worry about the
others lah
uh
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival what the basic survival need
eh
O K S I
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe ah I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya wah I mean
true lah true
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
uh system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict ah
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
ah
correct
mmhmm
um
wah
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
um
like uh
only for pioneer generation lah
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
ah
must use the ah reservation booking
yeah
uh whether they have space or not and but come on ah
the
this is the problem right find solution lah
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who ah
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is lah ah
so we just have to take care of ourselves lah that's why you know ah like

in times of crisis we need
if you can get if you need help we have to
get whatever we can lah
but don't beg
yeah
ah yes yes yes
I off all the light
and my window is closed ya
hundred three sixty degree
from always awake
I'm a morning person now
impossible right
I'm a morning person now bro
I made it I made it
mm
like sixty minute
oh
ah we stop this then we see we will do the others together alright K three two one

school is fine but it is very boring um because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
Y-
like from other courses kan
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
go eat together
then when your school start
true
mm ya
mm
mm
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
uh in the because we have like college west
east right
and then err west and east they don't
like because in like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your your behaviour
um
elementary business analytics and cyber security and and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like uh
tests we take tests we take uh we do assignments we do uh
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade lah like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
um
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
uh like
ah I talk about like first
ah seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like things you learn through life lah
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood ah that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
um
and
what's the thing
and
life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online jer lah but then it's very complicated because like
uh what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
uh mental uh mental disabilities is
a lot to that
and then
um minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then ah like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like err after finishing exam right
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
so it's just but I just want to sleep
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like oh my god we just stay in the first semester why ah why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
mm
mm
I think like
I think we're in also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
uh
mm
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
uh
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
uh
how you
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
how you
but then I find it very like
even
like
it's better if you can finish earlier kan in a sense but then
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand lah
because he is the type of person that think very like
oh he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
then after that
some people come into our class thinking that come to thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more lah a lot of like opportunities for students
our class is my class it's very competitive like
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like uh
like secondary school
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
it will be like very like easy right
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
uh
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like oh okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
oh my god
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
damn
this is gonna be hard and then ah I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
not a lot of paths for you to go
you know that
or you want to sign contract with and just work for a few months
uh for a few years and like
cause that's what I want to learn what since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity kan I just want to go for like child psychology
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking lah we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like ah you guys look down on but then like you must experience that cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter kan
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
when you go uni you fighting with secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if is this hard
that is the shock and then I think
go to poly after
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
like ego is what
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I uh sleeping
it's a good day but then it's like
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least eh there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like ugh
older and more responsibility in a sense
and then ah one of
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
I would choose studies lah if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you uh I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated ah she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
kan
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and aqil are going there for
err early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but hada don't want to go
studying a lot
she more prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
mm
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
mmhmm it's like
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like every
year right at the end of every year right
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
like like
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like ugh and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say ah
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes lah
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time lah but then like then you realise at the end already right
how I am
you have a lot of happiness in you
because my friends say you number one when you break up eh
like that's not good
it's but ah then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID kan
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even raziq sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january imelda is different from
september imelda now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
you know that kind of thing
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is raziq
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually ah I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
checks up on our like
uh she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
uh
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
in a sense lah
cause
ah
we just like uh
cause
but ah same to me ah
mm cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down

you know
ya so like
uh actually
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
ah this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
right now in the world when there are doctors especially this kind of uh jobs doctors so if no they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah uh that should be my answer but if
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
that's what I feel lah because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on on the fence ah on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
mmhmm
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
but then
at forty two eh forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but uh
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at ah
mmhmm
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
mmhmm but the moral is don't give up ah
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said ah everything you explore
on after the next day
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at lah
mmhmm
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
wow okay
okay
that's the first wish eh
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this one it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
um
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
yes
yes
yes
mmhmm
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
the society's
yeah
mmhmm
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
oh yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like oh my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
mmhmm
I mean
that's good for you lah because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me ah I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook oh
why didn't you take culinary eh
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
oh okay
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
hmm
yeah
precisely what I what I I said lah it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
italian
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay ah what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
yeah
no no no no no no I'm not gonna say that
no it's not
yeah yeah I have another one
I already have my answer
it was
yeah yeah it was sweet it was cute like I
we wanted
we wanted to do something lah
oh eh
oh a'ah
but ya so
so like
I remember that
ee
is it gonna be Seoul Garden
oh my god Nandos
oh my god they're the worst
oh I think you told me before
ya ya ya
definitely lah
oh yeah you have that once a year kind of
yeah I know
it happened this year
yeah
yeah it happened
it's something lah I think you I didn't sleep on that day
I remember I didn't sleep in January because you wanted me to stay because you were sick
yeah
I have one stupid question
I saw one
would you rather fight
one horse-sized otter
or a hundred otter-sized horses
you would you rather fight one horse-sized otter
you know otters right
or one hundred otter-sized horses
I
I think
I think I will fight the one horse-sized otter
but holy shit
yeah but it's like there's too many of it hundred eh
ya at least one horse-sized otter you can just run away from that one thing and is very big you know where it is
right
yeah
then at least you know where to you know who to run away from
this
and horses eh imagine you close your eyes a hundred horses even though it's more
horses
ah come on you know what I'm gonna choose
doctor stranger
duh
freaking cool
because scarlet witch is too strong for him
but this doctor strange I can go into places I can look at places I can look in the future I can look in the past I can go back and do this
there's so many things I can do
ya but I know what to do
if you I know when you gonna die
ya so like like that that that scene lah he went through with how many only fourteen million plus
timeline and there's only one that worked and he knew what to do
to make sure that one work
get it so that's what I'm going to do
so I'm going to like go into time
and like choose the best
timeline
then I'm like ah this one will do
get it yes
and and he's intelligent also so
oh my god I can't wait for the new one to come out I want to watch
I wanna watch
ya oh my god
I can't wait
it's
hmm
what do you deserve
oh okay
so metaphorically
metaphorically
oh so now you hate the the oh shit
and then
it
you get ignorance
hmm
I don't know what I'm gonna get
why
why
think I will get
a food that is intimidating
what you mean there's
to you lah because I I talk to you as a as a partner I don't talk to you as a
that's not what I get from everyone
that's not what I what I get from everyone else when I step into the room ya you you ask all my juniors
I have when I'm in work mode
they are scared
you know I'm just saying like I have that
work switch you know
so that that work switch and that
that
that aura that I bring when I'm serious it's very intimidating and
feels
for people is not approachable
that's what I got from people
it's not something that I think I am myself
but that's what people have been telling me
and I feel that has to change
if you want to teach someone you wanna help someone you can't be intimidating
yeah

it's it's a mother thing what no eh
I know you won't even eat anything in the kitchen
unless unless it's fried chicken
yeah
after cooking I'm talking about like like raw ingredient
I eat fishcake
well
you know
I
but that one
repercussion
yeah I like it
duh of course it's not
it's not
that
yeah
ya lah
I haven't had any
for
the last time I had was that one I had when I went to bugis plus with you
yeah exactly
that's like
that's like way before I had dengue seh
like a month at least
a month plus
no
I don't need bubble tea
I rather Boost
like
yeah yeah
and I when I was gym-ing ah
and I gain a lot of muscle mass
ya and and my dinner is like
why
mm
okay it's one hour already yes we did it
yay okay bye bye
bye

eh hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
mm
ya
ya
the same
have you checked
oh okay
ten gigabyte kan per month okay
oh
ya ya
uh
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years eh but I think you just bought kan iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade eh
oh still iphone lah
oh but I think recently you bought kan a new phone
oh
ya
unless you have wifi lah at home you already have wifi kan or
ya
ya
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
there's about four point seven inch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition ah I don't think so
let me check
there's no more ah sorry they don't sell anymore ah iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven lah so I think for camera wise if you love the camera kan take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough ah iphone eleven uh
not too sure ah cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven ah
ya alamak
who
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off ah
I'm not really looking to job search yet ah cause I'm doing freelance ah so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year lah I try to finish this projects and without expecting much lah I think I think the most important thing is experience ah and the skills that I will acquire ya
once I start working ah I'm more prepared ah prepared than ever
I think it's a bit hard ah because once you already
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test ah they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills ah you have the knowledge
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
ah ya
and they will ask you like on the spot lah like how do you solve this ah ah this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem lah I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is uh that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them lah
ya
it's more mostly interview skills lah that
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
ah monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast ah mm
the expected
oh
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you lah
oh
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
oh okay okay
ya
ya
ya
oh
ya
ya
mmhmm
oh
oh okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
ah the
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm
mmhmm
microsoft office ah
okay okay
oh ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed ah
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is uh I think
oh
mm
ya over work ah
ya
ya
yup understood
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding kan they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable lah you can still read the code ah like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
oh okay okay eh never heard before eh
even though I am a computer science
C hash eh
I think it's called C sharp ah
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before lah during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know lah this kind of
mostly low level lah like C sharp python eh sorry C sharp uh what is it called ah ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable ah than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing ah more structured
ya
mm
how do you spell logs
oh log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error eh
ya
mm
ya ya
ya
ya
ya
I think
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya nobody use eh
oh
mm
ya
mm
oh
oh okay
like
ya lah ya lah
clementi house
ya because they are
oh
ya true true
but you never never contact them
but you haven't contact them eh like never contact them
yup true true
uh the rice and
I think I need to start learn I need to start to learn cooking ah
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
I prefer to cook alone ah
ya
nearby lah
throw the like it's just
ya not much
ya it's not in the fridge ah it's like dried ah dried ikan bilis
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first ah
ya
it's homemade ah homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
I think the
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap ah
cannot cannot like that ah I think most women nowadays is they prefer to work ah kan but depends ah eh
ya
mm
ya
mm
so take turn ah
oh
ya
okay
ya for weekend ah
ya usually once a week kan like sunday
like
ya sunday off
ya
ya of course
mm
ya it's similar ah same as when you go to grocery
ya
then you are like it's like shopping ah
ah it's a virtual ah everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real ah I mean impossible ah but its similar lah it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
it's the same as you are shopping ah it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually lah
ya very interesting
ya I think like imagine like walking ah
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab kan
why
access to shopping mall eh is it
mmhmm
oh ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally ah I'm not too sure ah there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before ah I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
mm
ya
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
ya
the manager will ask ah like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint ah sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya
ah you also need to be involved in like zoom zoom meeting
for presentation
ya of course ah I think they are going to make one in singapore kan
ya
ah but I not too sure ah like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring ah mm I think a lot foreigner ah
oh ikea ah I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
so maybe I might go with him lah I'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant ah
of course ah open lah
but they limit ah they limit like
ya they make
one one table kan like ya seat of four or seat of two
ya couple family kan
ya
ya
oh counter table ya
oh
mm
ya yup understand
not too sure ah
oh
shopping mall eh is it like shopping mall
oh okay
ya ya
open concept ah
it's like open concept ah
mm
ya
oh ya ya
mm
mm
ya
mm truth
mm
ya
ya
restaurant or bar kan they they have a lot of
ya
ya lah
of course ah
ya
mmhmm
ambassador
ya
ah true ah
I think just make sure like everyone just follow ah cause now nowadays people like
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible lah just that location wise is a bit some ah some ya ya true ah some some ah some might be insecure a bit ah like
to be in track kan
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
ya definitely ah bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running ah it will still run ya because it need to keep checking kan
I'm not too sure ah I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise ah so I think they need like support of
I think so ah I think it's just the bluetooth ah like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device kan
ya this is not this is not easy ah because because I think they still updates ah they're still updating they are still improving
for apple kan and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone kan
Google
oh
android
mm
oh google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
mmhmm
yup correct
ya
ah ya ya
mmhmm
oh
ah
mm
I think so ah
the microphone is how far
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ah there's something
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
like
ya amazon products
ya
oh
mmhmm
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
I think not too sure ah like they have their own ya they have their own brand ah I'm not not sure what brand is that ah
maybe maybe they collaborate hmm
I think there might be lah not too sure like
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house ah like or what like
ya
ya because
they use leg
ah pedal pedal ya so they have to use
uh our hand lah our hand to press the button
ya
paya lebar ya I saw I went to paya lebar
oh
ya ya
mm
oh ya ya ya

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap eh
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like huh
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
it depends ah maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
mee goreng but you know me and mee goreng
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that mee goreng taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not lah
which I don't think it is
this is actually konjac jelly konjac you know C O N J A C
ah have you tried mala before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of mala cause actually I I went to hai di lao we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to hai di lao and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all lah
uh because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try mala they so bad you know like you have to try mala I was like what this this this big deal about mala sia everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too kaw
you know kaw
yes
like too strong like that
uh
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil lah
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you ah
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K nah
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya err okay K ya ya uh it so it's konjac jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this mala taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious eh
you think the conversation is good
like
mm
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets ah the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
uh uh
you can just throw it away
because
stingy ah
mm
mmhmm
um
ah okay okay so
was it yesterday that I was working
so the day before yesterday
bump into this one man ah he we were walking

and then
um he give you his card
and that card is a black card
okay is it his link card is black colour so no no no no no
credit card
like he bump into you so you ask for for compensation I think and then what will you do with the money

the series makes the thing much more alive
ya I think every idea
from now onwards like if you make it into a book it's fantastic it's good the idea is there the layout the foundation is there
but then to make it live that's like better
it is of of course it's like believable lah ya the whole fantasy is believable
because it's like you can see yes exactly it's a very visual
but it's a lot of work actually
ya he's just playing it out
he's the original zigzagoon
he's the original raccoon that's why the sister like that

love island
err
there is this show about
I just watch actually the other day um
the other lady
mm
they adopt adopt children
did you watch that
no you have to watch it I think
it's like too fast
but towards the ends ah very very actually very sweet
I don't know why I force myself to watch that
I'm like literally sitting down waiting to go to work then in the end I went to work late plus I was watching this
I don't know
oh eh when is your exams ah
mm how is school
what do you mean by normal
eh speaking of which
actually I have school sorry if I'm like cutting you off
I know I'm like a tricksy
I'm just going to take you out ah
K I have a diploma in mass comm
degree in business marketing
in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe lah but like now lately with all the mental stress
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know lah I was just thinking a lot about it ah I don't uh it's been about two months already
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
um
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way ah
because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like eh a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
mm everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus
sus suspicions
what do you think what should I
err ya
ya have to really think about it ya cause you invest in time as well
mm
ya no no because the thing is because of this whole economic downturn
K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
I thought of like changing
changing the career line lah
changing the career and instead of
this whole cause the whole of uh the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it lah
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm of course ah but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also lah
mmhmm
no like just diploma first
of course
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
because if you are talking about money yes I'm I have the job base
it's paying okay
just okay
and plus I can always pay pay installment yes malay people like installment
this is going to be
but no no uh of course obviously it's like school fees you pay installment what so
not that I don't want to move back with you guys but I'm so comfortable staying alone
mmhmm
mmhmm
yes on top of that you have add the the fact that you have to spare your time
yes I get that what the hell is this
wet tissue face mask
ah listen you are already what
nineteen bitch
I said bitch
why
won't it be exciting
treat it as a hobby lah instead
can
ya I know I know yes I like to be driven as well I don't like to drive people but the whole idea of like getting a license is like interesting
which will have to carry on
to the next topic
which I think would be fantastic
holidays

after this whole shi bang bang
what about the

mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya okay that one is a bit too touchy already but anyways
if given a choice
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
no because I've
I have travel all across europe not all across lah like maybe the western eh no eastern side of europe I remember it cheaper
like above
what was that the
the know not not not not not I won't said poor lah but that ya ya the eastern side of europe we should have a poor countries of europe everything there is cheaper right above france
ya not in france itself but ya the it is uh ya eastern side of europe
things are cheaper there
cause I was speaking to someone just now and then he was like
ya it's cheaper there but I haven't been there so I took the euro rail
ish ya

mmhmm after conversion ah
so you like you hop on hop off like anytime you want that kind of thing
so I went from all the way from
a train ride all the way down to sicily france everywhere ah basically almost everywhere
mmhmm
mmhmm

I need you to experience this with me I want to experience it again but I need someone which is like you to experience it with me
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
you know sya right

and then in the end just buy her place
I actually underestimate then she's actually
prominently
um financially stable is not stable is like financially well off
the fact that she say that the the dad can like easily just buy
apparently her dad is
like oh interesting
anyways ya they the dad and mum just bought over bought over just bought over I was like wah so casual ah just bought over so ya they are actually well off
I didn't realize that about her but anyways
that's I envy her lah
I love her whole approach to life
exactly exactly which we can't I mean
it's ya
yes
inshallah
exactly like I read that post on the instagram they were like the grass isn't always greener on the other side
the grass is always green when you water it
I was actually thinking about doing uh restart no
gardening oh no speaking of hobby K nevermind
err ya we we will lead to it ah which is one of it is actually
um I started playing stocks again
I thought of
I I followed this one guy he is american
so um muslim
but very americanized ah so is I don't know whether is how halal is it ah which is apparently is uh
everyone muslim is following him ah
so everyone muslim is doing the stock then I was like eh this whole stock is not really halal you know
but anyway so I'm just going to see how it goes
ah ya speaking of which um hobby yes
sewing I thought of getting a sewing machine
like soon
I actually plan to go down to gain or like gain city or challenger
I want to start stitching my own clothes
ya
ya lah this deconstruct lah like you exactly like that shirt
so maybe I can have like I this deconstruct one shirt
then I take tear off all the seams and then just cut off a pattern
you know pattern you can just uh oh paper pattern

just draw over or I don't even need to deconstruct I can just paper pattern
then I just ya trace trace trace
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm

it's a course
ya lah I mean like you can always note it out
mmhmm mmhmm
wait you have to use tools
like hitting tools
plier
uh huh uh huh
eh you know what I can incorporate you know why cause I was actually thinking of you know
um okay I saw that fashion show where they were doing like
those headpieces
with those beads pearls laces
I was actually thinking of incorporating that
into making a mask
you know the face mask that we are wearing
cause like everyone's wearing a normal
normal mask the most fanciest one is they buy from like
carousell whatever
uh ya very lame and cheap and always the same design
I thought of creating something that is like stand out
yes with beads lace
and then maybe can incorporate your methodology
or like earring whatever not not really earring lah but like maybe like some
metal pieces that you can stick you saw raja
the one the mouthpiece that raja wore the
that cover the whole face but leave out the eyes like catwoman like that kan cool kan
uh ya I thought of doing that
shall we
okay yes you and your exams when's your exam ending

I was like ya allah ya rabbi
I know but I was like brother
I know that I am yes I am sassy
but
the patience is really wearing thin
I think it's because of the numbers ah
how
mmhmm
ya
any hotel lah with a good bathtub
a really good bathtub
no lah not okay ya now I'm thinking of it I should actually just go to a spa right
no ya actually thinking of it ya actually should just take the spa
ya I want to ya as much as I want to be pampered but I don't like
I was like screaming ah ah ah ah then he was like oi I haven't even touch you yet
ya exactly
you know what I think it's because
I think it's because of
childhood
over the smallest thing is it feels like torture right
ee
serious serious serious serious
then you know how my size is so big that everyone thinks that I'm cuddly
like oh I want to hug I say you better get away I will smack you then you know
no I just want to get in a bathtub that's all
okay I have a pool upstairs
I swim at night but the thing it feels different if you
have
I just want to soak
I just
want to be appreciated I just want to be appreciated
ya I just want ya I just want to soak that's all like swimming pool yes I do swim alone at night at night alone so it's different ah
alhamdulillah it's like so rude
no irregardless I just want to like
mmhmm
actually you know what that time when I went to new york for new year's
new year's new york
this year how it really change eh
mm
ya next year should
come my friend is sell trying to sell me something
some E commerce thing
really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
no not twenty twenty is really slow walk ah but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location ah in the end we loved it ah
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop ah
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like um sya was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like eh the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like oh shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like huh
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
mm
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet eh seriously I need to change this carpet
mmhmm
see
alhamdulillah
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did what
exactly a long time ago what
yes samled
mister samled
he passed away he's a good boy
codeswitching
like towards the end I never expected eh
ya
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
he's been forever kan
since you were like four or five
ya four or five ah
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain orh
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
mmhmm
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
mmhmm
uh huh
shouldn't be that expensive what to entice people to buy what or like rent
downgrade
decrease
mmhmm
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small lah
a false wall
then like I'm like huh
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this ah
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like oh I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like ah okay no way
but it's costly lah
it's nice sia it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all kan with the window
oh ya speaking of which just now I pass by uh river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like oh my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
huh I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
ah that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
potong pasir
no
potong pasir yes
potong pasir I love the room because it was an upgrade
they clean once in a while it was nice
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
hmm
huh when
she cook curry
mm
huh then where was I
oh interesting
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this uh this time round lah but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like uh
eh no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
mm
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no lah I watched until the end lah eh no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya lah like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya lah because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious what
uh huh
oh is it
mm
oh is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
mmhmm
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
the what they ask for is system set the standard ah the standard ya no the standard lah because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes what
locked can you please lock the door
like the story line lah
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven eh
ya I don't know ah that one also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
mmhmm
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at choa chu kang
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him lah like if he deal with
which contains like vitamin A or something ah I forgot what he said current sixty plus
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle err severe cases
mmhmm cystic acne
oh that one I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like ah I'm on I'm on tight budget seh
but they they only accept cash ah they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
the exfoliator
why
ya
but this one also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this one is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
ya lah
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this
ya because your hormones balance off what
all your hormonal shit like happens
then what you want me to just to clear my face you want me to get married and give birth is it
I don't ah I'm trying this err
the supplement first but after that

you know the normal standard plaster I wanted to cut
but it's in the middle of my face then like stupid right
should I try I'll try later
pimple I hope my kids don't get it

ya then you it didn't work for you what so you give me then that was my very first foundation ever in my life
ya it's too thick it's so dirty
foundation like required me to use like double cleansing or what but I didn't what
I don't think I even had a makeup remover I just washed my face with face wash I think that point of time
it's only online what
no I never use all I stopped already

too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can eh as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty ah
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can ah
ya

so how did the anime help though
mm
oh that's cool
oh my god
this is like toy story
like tiny people like just random people
that's cool
err
okay like I I retook
O level art like
so I took O O level art two times ah the first time like I did it then I took it again in secondary five
uh so there was two time like the first one was like achieve it to my
grandfather who passed away
ya
so that was quite like close to my heart lah
like mm oh my god I'm gonna cry like err I incorporated like things that remind me of him like there's this biscuit lah like he always like offered me
he
ya so
and also err
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like uh our expressions were like sad lah to show
and for the sofa pillows kan like
uh
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that uh I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like uh apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took uh O level art um it was
it was
I don't know it was like a quiff
artwork ah it was it was like mostly about my hair lah about my pink hair I don't like I didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like uh previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
uh for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
I miss painting and drawing
also like lately I've been trying to draw a lot
also I I I I joined a art competition like my school's art competition lah like it's being held from
like err err
like sketch club ah
so ya
ya for sure and I've been lazy
true true
yes
just high ah
true true
ya
like content heavy kan
true true
ya
just polytechnic life
so what are you planning to do for your future
mm
I see
I see
actually ya
ya I'm in like chemical engineering so that's quite interesting
so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy lah
I think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what I want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like err
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university lah
then uh let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool lah
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work orh
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
mm
because the pay for it is
still
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave kan
ya
like
true
two K jobs like only earn like two K plus or like one K plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive seh
true
ya
but that's so bad lah obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens
mm
true
true true
mmhmm
what
mmhmm
mm
but I'm shook
but I'm shook at the fact that he go Zoom call at the staircase like out of all places
mm
true true
mm
true true
a lot of now is also like they carry out using Zoom Zoom calls
you know
but that's so boring though
but okay lah at least something you know compared to like nothing at all
confirm when I grow up I want to be a farmer
I don't know
okay lah that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but I want to be like a full on farmer I don't know I think I've had this dream like since secondary school
like I
why why
uh
I know but like maybe ah maybe that's part of it ah but it's not like entirely him right it's not like I want to like have a farm with him or what sia like but I genuinely just want a farm
like I want to be rural
then like just vibing
you know
no I'm so shy
no
no
ya
true
oh actually true
but I don't think they do it on top of housing though
oh ya I guess so
you don't even eat vegetable like you don't eat your vegetables at all
ee
ee
that's another you
it's good ada vitamin dia semua
alright see I'm a genius
I need to tell that to my grandmother
but I hate mutton taste
I hate mutton it smells like shit
ya I like vegetable
why
oh you god yes
mmhmm
mm
mm that's cool
oo
oh my god
oh
to buy
to buy
yes
ya true
thick
like your thighs
mm
ya
a'ah
really
video
mm
mm
oh ah
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
ugh uh is this a question
oh okay okay ah change the world I don't know oh my god I want to be more environment friendly oh my god talking about environment friendly
so I join like uh
like I join ah then I went to this
this uh
what's it called
I don't know what is it call it's like a outing I don't know it's like oh it it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like uh
stands for bring your own bag like uh
they held this thing like uh we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that err we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then um we will take out those uh which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then uh we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags ah so it was quite so it's a
uh then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption lah
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
to
like
like they implement like certain things ah to make it better
like I think the like pulau semakau like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast ah then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
ya true true
ya imagine like fifty cents it'll be like more like
ya for sure
so that's cool
why
and I never ask for plastic bag I bring my own bag
when
I'm so proud of
yes
change the world
yes just like how michael jackson sang it
change the world

ya so he has a store
to sell mask
err
before that he was err after
then after that they do safety for the week
ya so ya lor so that's pretty much he he does lah
totally ya we talk and talk and talk and talk and talk
then um
we
so ya lah we were there
ya we went there then after that
eh alamak closed closed then we went to err the
it's
ya ya ya ya there's one standalone stall
I don't know man I just there like okay lah
err
ya put aside lah it was
ya ya
ya wasn't so enjoyable because I was like ah shit you know so much so that
so same P one
my daughter also now P one
err maybe one day we can ask him over lah
to our daughter
pass away who pass away
that was like many many many years ago right
ya err family eh
ya
so
ya lah
punggol punggol
I don't know like how many like
you know quota something like that lah but apparently
he
I'm not so sure I think what I I have a feeling probably it's an english school or what lah I never I heard lah I forget to ask what's the
the name of the school
ya
uh huh
yup
oh
okay wait for the place okay
okay okay okay I just now this err today lunch I ate at jurong point do you know that jurong point there is like a japanese kind of like halal place do you know
ya ya ya no no no no it was at err along this err
the swensen's all that lah that was that
I don't know
probably I think so ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
we we finished already we finished eating so we just pass by there
err
ya he just she's not into that kind of food lah I I think so lah
eh three daughters
like the the eldest one is like what twenty three twenty four like that
so ya lah
that's that
tomorrow err tomorrow tomorrow
uh
oh then after that the ya
then no after that no more already lah right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how aiya ilan madrasah
slippers you mean
mm
mm ya
oh okay
ah okay lah
okay
oo ya
oh
ya talking about her ah
oo that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story ah because err
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing lah but the timing is also like err odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish ah
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early lah but sometimes
ah they go off or sometimes
when you work late ah you have to finish late lah you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back ah
not that bad ah
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back lah right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off ah something like that or
something like that lah alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is err I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish ah
err I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know lah and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early lah to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she oh then this one ah I will ask sani to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear ah kan
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out ah then after that she like go out ah then she like alamak aiya I like I also don't want ah to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything lah kan
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this one because they are like contract ah
ya contract not staff
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this lah you put in extra hours lah you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing lah it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like err worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
ah ya
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit ah and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you ah hani ah hani can and
ah ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like err
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
mm mm mm
yup maybe we should go there
art ground also ya
oh then you better check lah
mm hmm
eh
mm is it
ya ya ya ya
who who who just said ah I remember one of the maid does that
where is it ya
yulis do that can't remember lah that maid do that
so anyhow ya
oh I don't know no no ya okay wait
uh ya ya ya
kan
oh
you you you
know he has been sleeping late because ya every ya every night I come back
uh the light will be on not how
so I just
okay
okay
eh
so ya so probably what the art ground so think lunch at home lah ya probably lunch at home
I don't know that
oo okay
discovered ah
so I no no more already ah I did I did buy something like for myself some potato chips I think potato chips yes
then there is chocolate also we got chocolate right
snickers at the end I never I haven't tried
um

where's the place ah jurong west ah
jurong west where
I don't know I don't know
I don't know lah seriously
group ah
like you call yourself like oh what from the ex black hole
if if I'm black hole I will sue them man
oh is it but I just I just find it weird lah
because it's it's like my brands lah
okay you you want to advertise ya I I I think I have to be upfront about it lah
like you don't use my brand ah
like say eh I'm from err Adidas like that one Nike you know
ex Adidas err it just logo right basis like shoes right
ya but but I think it's just because our context like singapore is too small I say it's like ah
I say like I'm I'm ex you know
I don't know I just I think like he
I just feel it like it
come from like you you leave me and you you open up the same thing as me you get what I mean not
so it's like I I leave
my
agency and I set up another agency but I still leverage on err that agency's name I think it's just
if you open up something else probably lah but I don't know
ya but you took to advertise I don't know
advertisement ah like you know right it's ah
if I if you are like the owner how how do you feel
ya ya where were you from oh I used to work here okay lah
it feel like advertise herself as that is the header lah
I'm from like ex ah
okay
I I think it's it's maybe not right lah
ya
ya so so many things err
ya
okay
okay
okay
oh
ya
oh
oh
the
okay
then his shoes his black shoes how ah
this one this shoes also quite new ah I don't know whether want to sell whether want to
then you sell and buy another shoes the one that the friend gave you know
right
never use lah that shoes
ask him to use but I think that that his black shoes still can use eh
but I I ask him to eh never wear this shoes what he says what
ya according to him lah I don't know
ya
oh that day got one somebody enquire about the
the japanese shoes you say you want twenty bucks then I say thirty bucks
then I say like thirty bucks lah you want I say oh I need to try I say come lah you come and try lor
then no answer already
so ya
mm
ya but I've been keeping it and not wearing it also so it's
no because the thing is to be honest the shoe is quiet big for me ah
I think bought err like
so I'm wearing err a nine point five but that one was a ten
eh
big big because different ah I think the cutting different certain shoes like like my Jordan I'm wearing nine but certain shoes I wear nine and a half
but
what I do right now buy shoes online right I would like go and try first
try first and after that
ya try
so this is my first time lah
okay
yes

ya see whether can
soccer boots soccer boots
actually can
can but I don't know that one is it's
right
what ten dollars

err
ya because the thing is when I buy it's also second hand
so I don't know better
ya but I bought it second hand
that one I bought in so I don't know whether this one
authentic or not authentic so I really don't know really
because I went to the cobbler bukit maju right
then he say eh eh actually I got another shop at just wanna try it on

I have two boots
I fix one boot then I buy another boot why ah
so I don't know why ah

secondary school ah
ya ya why my softball teacher my teacher wah seh
I don't know leh last I talk to him was in february I think cause I went down to school lor other than that not much eh cause his insta but never reply to
literature
you got a lot of people right in your group of friends
hmm
surprisingly no leh I never met any of them outside school I've never seen them not even teachers I've never seen teachers outside school but right a bit a bit funny cause I got a teacher who live near me but I never see her before like I know she lives there I seen her once or twice in secondary school but now I never see them anymore
ya ya ya that one
ah hangout ah
but right cause a bit also have but then I I I reason it out my mother ah cause she always make me say cannot other people one actually it's already out there if I don't finish then who else will finish you know
ya very troublesome because like I want talk to them also a bit mafan ah but then thankfully ah I don't have more than five group of friends lor is like in a group of friends I don't have more than five so like just swee swee just like that lor like swee swee less than five all lah like swee five so like don't need a lot of table like I see my friend that one that time they book three table leh I don't know how many people they have but three table then like very secluded so very difficult to like catch up with them so ya I a bit thankful lah for that
I always buy the standard shake with nata de coco fifty percent I now member mah so like I can the nudge you know so like when you collect the you buy the drink ah you collect the point then you can like off set when the next time you buy then you know last time during circuit breaker cause last time mister coconut and bubble tea all close right then you got see or not the trend they got buy the handmade LiHO then they make it at home you got see
you you you got try or not
ah no ah cause I find it a bit expensive also ah then like the bubble tea the boba ah the pearl ah a lot leh then I scared cannot finish then is is a it's like a golden pearl kind then I don't really like the golden pearl I only like the black pearl or the black sugar pearl eh brown sugar pearl
I got try eh Playmade but I don't really like Playmade eh to be honest cause ah their pearl is a different ah it's not tapioca pearl it's not like the normal pearl it's a different kind of pearl lah then I don't really like the taste ah then the I know everybody like Playmade ah but like I find their pearl a bit a bit a bit questionable not to my taste bud ah probably probably you can try then you see then you tell me lor
I
no eh I never but like cause last time my sister same poly as you ah she also say she always buy like McDonald's only like subway I got try your school subway that one once only but then I also know your school McDonald's is cheaper then outside McDonald's right
I saw their McDonald's cone is seventy cent
actually uh I never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe I should try one day then you leh
I think standard ah I think all poly also got subway and cheers also if I'm not wrong you school got cheers
I also know your school quite big then how ah if you late to school or like you swee swee you just ah you know five minute before school you reach then how ah you confirm late or not
actually not really ah honestly if I late to school then my my my my class at the end of the school ah only take me about five five minute to reach there so I can like speed walk then I can just reach earlier but it's quite quite space ah got a lot of big spaces lor but better ah than it being cramp I guess so like not too bad ah but still small ah but like spcious also to say the least if I'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no ah nanyang nanyang bigger then then then then my school
honestly right um my first few days of school ah my first few weeks I cannot make it but then but then like afterwards like okay already lor uh but then like uh how to say ah your my school um some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that one I a bit confusing ah and then the one behind my school is just the sports centre so that one only if you got like if you got like like that ah like then you go there lor
hmm
um honestly cause of COVID right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the I saw the security uncle tell the person you you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student the student was like no I want study then you should study at home ah the uncle was damn rude eh then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it wah like this security uncle cannot say nicely meh COVID already then like be understanding ah we understand you got superiority but like
hmm cannot ah I think they will be stopped at the entrance I think like cause they wear uniform already mah then I don't think so they can go in so like I don't know I don't even think so they can cause nowadays when I go back to school some times I don't see them like coming over also then like I think it's um a a rule for them to go back home afterwards I don't know but either way also the place is crowded lor cause got student want to use the wi-fi for mah ya
ya but like our table not so far apart um like they put us five people per table but like how to say ah um they so one metre one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling mah that one a bit ah cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful I guess but like ah don't know ah it's just a bit lor
um sometimes it cannot be helped ah because like is mah then everybody need to use it need to take it for for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take Gojek and all the transport mah so like um sometimes cannot take it ah cannot be helped so like public transport cannot be helped ah
a bit scared ah but like I said cannot help it like I a bit scared cause I live with my grandmother so it's uh the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes I a bit scared leh but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe lor don't interact with other people I think that's the best ting to do lor
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still one the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot ah cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at bedok eh a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit ah cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry mah she find it very
ya lah typical she doesn't like to take unless like she late lor then she take Gojek lor or she take grab
no ah it's actually me I help her book then she just pay lor
nowadays got not much work from home ah but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp ah then the rest all is um cannot work from home ah so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks
uh I actually don't mind ah cause she make food mah so I just eat whatever she cook lor
ya cause fast game ah just touch and go so I just go there then come back then like that lor
if I go school right I just buy something for breakfast then I go home to eat my grandmother lunch I don't like you know uh eat outside so that's the good thing ah I I get to save money like that
wah then especially are especially hor they tax you see what they could wah kung fu aunties anticipate at their excited one ya ah anyways ah I think it's time to let go I think we I think we are done catching up I think
nevermind give this person some time ah cause COVID mah then the business never go up at least at least give them some some some money you know
ya serious ah whatever lah okay lah

okay can
hey you aunty
I'm doing okay
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter lah the what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
oh really ah so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only lah
oh so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
aww
could you feel like the maternity love already
ah like a responsibility ah
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know lah what is a sign
ah ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet lah
okay cool sis so anyway um
you know ah later I'm going to go err have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having ah is asking me ah all type of weird questions one
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person lah better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is um
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya lor
mm mm mm mm
oh
err but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
ah so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago ah what what would you probably be saying to yourself
oh ah
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me ah I think ah ten years ago I was sixteen right
oh
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met hakim or risahd which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing sia like if I didn't meet him right
activities are very lah so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with hakim also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring ahmad along so we go gig we go um
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met amin yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl ah
eh you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy lah okay
err are you still longboarding err probably all that lah probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit ah I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me ha is the
um
walao eh got so many questions you know they ask
oh ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay lah okay lah ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
what what other things would you be petty about
oh
a'ah ah
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys ah right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
oh ya lah ya lah
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
uh huh uh huh
walao eh why she like that one
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it huh you want to fight
me ah pettiest reason ah
err pettiest for reason for me to oh my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay lah petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like aiya like dislike a bit ah ah it's like our dearest lor
ah like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
if ah like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so ah sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but ah
ya that's true okay but then again it is lah correct lah it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a like common sense thing
but ya but then ya lah it becomes petty because ah whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him ah like ah no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate lah right just like annoyed
can
oh is it like what
oh ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone lah right
ah
mm
mm
ah ah oh oh oh
oh because you were julie
oh cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up lah
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya oh you mean she said hi to everyone except you
oh I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it lor
ya lah ya lah for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest lah this one is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's um
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past ah right it's just like
like some people like make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like oh is it okay lah then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
what I do sia I don't know I just come sia so it's like
and then it's just because of the nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why err ah like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class ah was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that err her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class one not
ya ya like and then like
ya then eventually I found out that eh you know ah she she say ah like she got say to me before
why why all these guys like me lah ah she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your err physics ya exactly
okay so far it's okay
eh but then ah she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the to bangkok I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because um she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend ah like you
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend lah like you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
wah I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
that such a person exist that can be so
so ya lah but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her lah I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her lah but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now lah it's just more of like
mind blown by it like walao eh like I could never sia go through that trouble for man ya lor
so ya petty things ah huh that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me one but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered one
alright okay this one is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mmhmm
oh mm mm
ya ya
oh my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot eh
a'ah ya lah ya lah
err can play a lot of things siol can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like uh so it's just a random skill like oh you so you can do that then you're like ya lor I can
oh that's great sia like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
and then I'm like die lah ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like oh she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
walao eh confirm can one lah it's just one line don't be petty lah we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking ah
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful ah skill
second skill um
so random ah but I would pick up sea sea diving eh
mm so fun sia
like in general I've uh I've always been intrigued by the sea
like that's why when shai like her videos ya tioman I always feel like wah best sia ah like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where oh it's very doable you just go tioman
ya but so far eh you know can touch the okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see kan everything so so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
if I could pick up
ya ya
a'ah a'ah ya
correct
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright sia then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent seh because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing lah
but then I won't be singer lah like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya lor
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions ah
ya lor ya lor
how do you think oo
ah
hmm
light effect
alright um wah if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya lor
I know right
okay this one is the actor is the very everybody will know one
oo
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to err exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya lah ya lah you skip that part lah
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
mm where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
alamak you kills
oo
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few booboos but then again kan he's young
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but then I'm like you all shut up lah you all young
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy sia
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
he is even more powerful sia season two
ya
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all you all not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom err from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing lah like he gives platform for like like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
he was sharing ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
ah he will share it ah and then everybody will send their entry ah so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married lah but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for err everyday
okay eh no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
I learnt about johnny depp's err wife not wife ah they never married ah vanessa paradis I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
he okay another person okay sorry this one is also this one is also actually quite epic ah if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version lah actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world lah she's like
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane ah even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also see what she does in a day ah like I think she's so inspiring sia like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to err explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her sia for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever lah
but whatever it is ya lah like cheating cannot be justified lah right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and uh angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
like she's a gemini so I was like sia lah a true gemini sia this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like sia that's like me but like back then lah when I was reckless lah so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt wow
ya oh my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your uh stray kids or like
what do you mean
ya because ya you have to be super disciplined
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya ya like ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman ah
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
oh maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
ya what is your capability what can you do ah can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
err I can't
err no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
no lah it's our opinion mah
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
okay lah obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five suria like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
oh my god imagine
it would be so epic sia
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like in singapore characters in general can be so
walao eh
ya lor ya lor actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
but then ya lah for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where ah
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how lah right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the lah so it's just purely in our imaginations ah
ah how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm correct
eh my god I can imagine sia my one is the zombie
then after that err getting comfortable
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
no eh but then ah you know the singapore and is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our our government will
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually lor
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month lah then the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually lah when but singapore will be the last lah to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy lor so we were all lose weight very drastically
oh okay obviously at each country oh ya because this one humans were extinct right no hope what so no choice lah everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
ya because of a pandemic seh
err
ya
mm ya lor
uh anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
oh my god eh wait wait wait but is activity eh
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like err maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
next okay next
ya
eat damn slow lah like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely lah like sia I imagine like running running for eight hours
everything what other thing maybe is the err
but that one is like quite therapeutic sia sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't lor I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
what other things that we do like everyday activities sia
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
uh uh
if you
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
walao eh
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya lor then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like ugh okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful one
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this one even more sia you cannot sleep in peace eh you sleeping there lah then like then got hi
then another one hi the patient will like uh shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating sia like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya lor who know you got the dark secret but ya lah I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing ah
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya ya ya
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya lah
but it's too dramatic ah
girl or boy
ya ya ya
how old is he again ah one year older eh or your age
oh
twenty six eh twenty eight
oh nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know uh it's the same uh the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
aunt allyson has eh is damn
ya eh it's damn strong sia babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya lah so that's why I said unless she use that power only
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse ah
I would love that power
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life ah so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault lah kan because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it what and she had to go through her downs for her to like oh shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again eh honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing what it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died seh for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish sia
oh and then he's said oh why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes wow
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
ya
ya
I feel like allison is compromising a lot sia she's so nice like nah
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine sia and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
oh my god
mm that's why
okay ah
oh my god you're so right
ya lor stay here forever lah
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house mah
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say ah it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
like okay at twenty one you are all
err entitled to a
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if err twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot lah seh
then will be like
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya lah I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay lah
alright uh
what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
oh right right right right okay eh I get to know you more lah seh babe from here

yeah when the last time we meet ah
oh yeah yeah yeah then it was like damn rushing cause like we came there at nine then but then it close at nine thirty
yeah so long and then some more don't have the ah pearls that I want like seriously

oh my god we should open the cafe together
yes yes
mmhmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
full business like
like
yeah yeah and all
so like I think that's a good idea because like you never know whether your business will flourish and be successful so
a'ah
yeah
yet
true
one
one thing for your
is that we should open
I think the west people will appreciate it
ya that's why we should like oh my god you know what you should do we should
also sell bubble tea at same time that's what will make us have money gain money yes
oh

purpose so what's the good food there

uh
the
email right

it's not yet lah I think sooner probably I think maybe waiting for teachers
no they asking about you but okay lah
you all go and make your own plans lah we make plans
and after that we still need dessert and we still need coffee is they got so many things to talk about
you lah
what's yours
must be the crumbs lah don't know how many time we must wipe the table
kids
it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time
is it end of the year thing is it
I I expect you to go to the one at bugis the bigger one
ah that's
hospital
then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
oo that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government
eh
you have to wait equipment first ah
oo I thought they pay for you
who
huh you know you have a friend but you don't know who
oo
oo
you saw him or he told you are
oo
what you mean they have different different team eh
err
okay lah think can you can make it lah
ya lah
lah whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first lah while waiting for something that you used to do
lah
later the zoom
you do alone eh I I don't need to join you okay
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
the first to teach err tasha
get the malay students to love
malay
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
so that's why I think it's a great loss err and she's there I think according to tasha it's like what she's only there for three years
so tasha was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one lah
uh
tasha is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
tasha is the first batch she teach three years lah
three years eh five years
ya initially tasha doesn't like her what
but in the end
a'ah see
her class what
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is nadia she pick and choose
it will affect her this what I notice ah
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around lah
because I think
tasha tasha also what
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
which now you don't expect her to dance lah she's got no interest already
nadia my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that oo tag rugby
oo touch rugby tag rugby
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego ah the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active lah she is like she is active since young so
she's daring lah she she has the confidence
can lah let her try lah
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store lah tasha tasha hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs lah
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set what knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay lah
it belongs to tasha or belongs to her
then it should be able to lah and tasha use
should be lah it's kids size what
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
eh she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
err going bishan on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff
going bedok saturday eh
I know that's why she said come on saturday because she's not going to jurong so everybody's there
sunday is a brothers in law second marriage

the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch ah
the whole box
try try not to give so much ah they're coughing

very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you lah see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast lah
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway lah but she haven't message me
peck seah P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start err preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time lah the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind ah if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition what
amirah's err siblings they have tuition
ah
I thought amirah go for err oo visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
uh but math class
my only worry is nadia's math I mean ya now she's average ah but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is tasha cannot help much also with maths
at least science
err english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind lah
at least if we start her early because we started tasha like only in P five
right started tasha with five
hmm
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as tasha
ya she did
okay lah
together

oh okay okay okay ya see I see I see then when when you come back from err batam I I know you went batam but I when did you went to batam
you went there for your business
I see
ah okay okay that makes sense I was thinking of why why you have to go through the whole long process then when you when you come back to singapore
twelve err november
orh then after that you have to quarantine for two weeks lah ah
so how how is the quarantine in singapore the people a lot people complain lah facebook lah they say not nice lah some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from batam or is there any requirement that you need to get
okay
ah
ah
ah okay okay okay so you you
batam from batam you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront
but I'm not sure
mm
okay
very
ah it's just probably he never come back to singapore for seventeen years lah probably
ah maybe
ya lah too much lah this one ah anyway ah so your two weeks how okay everything
ah
ah
orh
ah
uh huh
okay lah
ah okay
ah so now after that you doing deliveroo ah okay lah deliveroo so usually what time you start for weekend for your deliveroo I mean as in food delivery
ah
okay
mm
oh
okay
ya true true true
you manage your own time you manage your own money everything is you on your own lah okay lah
ya true
talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks dah end of the year already wah very fast man correct or not ah
alamak
ah
this is a new beginning ah they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know lah ah I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
sixteen march eh
but but very fast ah nine months
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one ah that's what they said is probably two two lah so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
mm
okay lah spend money in singapore lah staycation now government give ah hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel lah I think you have to book to those but five platform only
the places that you want to go err places of interest or staycation
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass ah and then from there then you can use lah you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
okay lah they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore lah but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one lah so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period ah
eh
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo jurong bird park sentosa I don't want lah so all these places went already ah so I need to go something different ah maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night ah maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels lah you want to go those like hotel ah of course you need to come out still same price lah not much difference ah anyway
ya
ah
serious ah
government give us ah
mm
ah
ah okay okay I understand
ah so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing lah
huh
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah lah example ah one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
be quite too expensive or what
no
huh
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
huh I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then uh hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up what then what's the point of
huh
bullshit
huh
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive what right so why is the other way round
what the
really happen
until now ah
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
oh that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better what
funny ah
why ah like that
anyway
ya
ah ah
ah and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars oh my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe ah maybe whoever pick up that story ah and then share share share share ah
I do not know ah shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is johor one is woodlands so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet ah whoever pick up that story ah go viral ah
no lah he I think yes he no eh
this year ya correct correct because right right right
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual err wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel kan for him
ask his wife to come singapore ah bring in
he is going back to johor
so he's
then after that he's
oh he is going back johor now
then
no pay leave two months lah singapore no pay leave two months ah
ah then after that bring in the wife come singapore
huh
oh ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia johor you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation lah
but singapore
the the the cases zero what community wise why go there still still need to
subsidise lah
I mean if if if now err the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go johor knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
funny lah they all anyway
it's okay lah at least happy for him lah at least you know see his wife
mm
investment lah it's good investment lah
ah
ah
ah
the two weeks
that one two weeks two weeks you stay worse
you never join the apps ah they got apps like zumba lah exercise lah yoga
ah then
I also do other things also at the same time I also helping my my
friend doing this err food
so now we are
for what
okay
ah
ah okay lah
ah
ah I see okay lah
ah so call like a whole set lah
ah
okay okay okay
so he did that also lah
but now because of this COVID thing lah
so for me nowadays you you see my new family cusina
oh ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing ah because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation eh whereby if let's say you go to
thai vietnamese
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
ah is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and err gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place lah be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put err err err
different taste local of a filipino taste lah so yes we did that already so alhamdulillah there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
home made ah
hopefully lah
a'ah
ah
correct
ah
ah
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully lah ah be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet lah because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first uh uh
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it err
if you go into this that it's call
thai thai I thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert lah then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
okay lah good lah I was thinking
correct
true
ya lah
so ya lah so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully lah hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit lah
so I I I I will add you don't worry I will add your I know who is this toklang right should I accept should I not this is a scam later somebody I also do not know then after that add already ah this one ah could you give me money this one transfer here oi so many nowadays so that why I worried since you say that is your account I will accept and I will add you
ah that's why I was thinking alfi already got the account what so this one is this one is err new account the other account get hack or what I also do not know but
I will accept that don't worry then I will add you to a dot J underscore kusina or kitchen kusina kitchen
ya
from the house itself lah so probably now also weekend right so nobody wakes up early what
right
then the order
okay lah but then
from ten to maybe two lah today
then
aduh
uh I thought somebody want to come out summon what
ya lah can one
then after this you straightaway go
do do grab already ah I mean do do deliveroo already ah
ah
ah
ya true true
and ah for me today oh today I think I go back later I still need to I just another order coming today banana bread with chocolate melts
that means the banana bread you cut that banana bread inside there is chocolate melts
whoever order this one because no I I do I mean friends or whoever wants to order from me right I mean there are
food I mean standard lah default default like I do this okay that means for example banana cake or I do strawberry cheesecake cups with blueberry cheesecake cups
so these are the standard item standard food but if let's say you want to have something extra inside like example banana cake is just banana cake so someone ordered
ashraf can I ordered banana cake with chocolate melts inside
can
the other guy wants the chicken which is
super spicy different from these three they want something like spicy spiciness how lah this spicy okay lah can lah I can do for you so it's
can be done lah not say cannot be done it can be done like muffin also we do the same what we have blueberry
we have err blueberry muffin banana walnut muffin
uh chocolates muffins so even to have something different can lah we customised to
your tastes lah ah ah so ya we do that lah alhamdulillah lah so today
there's order later five so still have time to go back
and then do cooking ya so we we try to do during I mean
uh we we can't take too much order yet because of
both of us working and then err you know so we
try to take those like during the weekend in advance lah so at least we we can prepare in advance the food the ingredient ya plan plan out what are the things that we need to prepare lah
uh so
I think they came down from from slope correct because err I think behind us is all those private houses right I think there's those err

okay
err
thank you so much okay so um
uh are you studying now are you working tell us more
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great ah okay
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
okay
it's it's not a definite shape I can say ah it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or ah specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
unique
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
a few types of mango
and yeah
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit
so ya moving on err
nah when like I don't know supermarket
err
err hangs around the station
like late at night
so
okay thank you so much
uh ya exactly like I mean uh
in singapore it's it's a very common fruit to find
um
and as products they they come in varieties a variety of products
what do you think
mmhmm mmhmm
err
beauty products so
okay in other forms of food
like like my sister said it's err
for me it does makes me feel happy
err
mango tea kan
dessert
exactly cause
it's
yellow
and
it just draws
err mango bingsu
err
perfect
sunshine eh
um
it's like a brand
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a uh err a fruit name for a brand because
uh they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all lah because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
I guess
that's interesting
okay
I feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
hmm
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean uh that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
we don't really think about
oh my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs ah we there's also
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
pudding kan
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
about having mango soda
do you have have you had any mango sodas
okay
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking kan um
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about um
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
okay
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
it's way before all of us
and there are a hundred types of mango
each with a unique taste shape
so
okay this fruit is not only delicious but boasts
it's actually quite true cause
that
okay the fact that it has it's sweet
eating snacks that is high in sugar you know like
it's
I don't know it's
it could be replaced with just eating mango which is amazing
mango and its nutrients to health benefits
uh it's a good news right because we love eating mango so much
that uh
we know that it has its health benefits
like ya uh such as improved immunity okay that's one of the benefits
wow that's really interesting
protein about
uh vitamin C sixty seven percent of
the reference daily intake
vitamin B six eleven point six percent of the
okay err vitamin A ten per cent of the vitamin E nine percent nine point seven percent of the
vitamin B five six point five percent of the

mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
ah
hmm
five
oh
just focus
ah
I know I know
mm
oh
oh
mm
but how ah
but what's the rationale fifty per cent
oh ya ya
oh
ya
so far you okay lah manage ah
A
oh
ya
cause of combination kan
that means you must do well every ya
eh this one ah
mm
mm
so early
mm
ah
oh
mmhmm
that means next year lah
ah
mm
I mean you propose lah
mm
taxing kan
mm
ah
ya
mm mm
for that one year lah kan
ah
additional lah
mm
huh
seven days
your your syllabus eh
ah two year okay lah alhamdulillah
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
how the worst
but is it reported to the authorities or not

okay
okay ya
we're good
ah eh eh
eh bro school is eh I hate school
school can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay eh I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules lah
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay ah then I got one website for my
uh module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites kan is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like you know you know
amongst the students lah
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like eh this one how this one how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that lah to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like um there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions ah
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota lah
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat lah having a lecture or having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
ask even the professor lah
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively what
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday sia just to do work
mmhmm ya
ya
but
not not on the first week lah like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example ah python err you there's this one
ah ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input ah input format lah
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
it's it's just so bad ah like and then
I don't know like even the other day
err I have this other module okay
ah it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics lah
I I got some friends lah I got some friends here and there
then the other day I I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
ah like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad lah because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things eh
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say Singapore university of self study eh
okay like that's what people say lah my friend also say that he's in
and then after that I'm like okay lah maybe is terrible lah
but then when I come to I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
I don't know ah to me it's it's it's just nonsense ah
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two
err asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up ah just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy lah honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent lah
this type of high
um really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother one ah
they really not brother one but but right at least it's they quite brother lah because
err and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty lah
ya lah ya lah irfan</P1 your age lah but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty eh
ya I eh
ya ya uh everyone there is from like or from poly
wait eh hang on eh
ya ah
ah okay
but
oh part time uni
err um
oh honestly the
I don't think even is a
I don't know is a good choice or not I got I got two friends in
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work lah
there's things to do here and there
ya I think is mainly for people from like from poly the more rilek ones lah the one the not so snake one
ya
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
which is ten percent of my grades
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test lah eh no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so so my they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down eh where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they ah
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya lah
stewing from that lah
ya is it is a browser lah on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test lah
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test what
so they ah and then after that the test got webcam ah
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam ah either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam what
ya ya ya um the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
by the way
you have a report ya ah
cause
ya then yesterday I spent like the
I think I spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because I've never actually I have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
err like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
I mean
but
would uni I actually have to write I had like ten tabs open just
for
um just for this report section
ya lah I'm but as in what I'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
I got one friend who is taking this module as me
then you know he's just panicking ah
mm trimester
ah so but then for the first year
ah
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when I was comparing I was talking I was telling I was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in or even in you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because I have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay lah maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay ah trimester but then eh my trimester
thirteen weeks also eh then I see eh their semester
what did I sign up for my my I got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small lah
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough I'm trimester based you know
ya
no lah err ya lah ya lah
serious I didn't I didn't expect it to be
I didn't expect it to I have to put in so much effort you know
like mm
ya like my sisters were like wah koi koi run
utterly hardworking eh and I'm like no lah I just unfortunately I have to be a hardworking lah
I also don't want to be hardworking but
you know unfortunately I have to be
it's just unfortunately I have to be
eh but you're applying for uni you you're applying for uni or are you going to apply for uni
what was your
mmhmm
I think I think march close I think march close
so you did online interview
why how did you screw up
okay
everyone's volume is err everyone's work is high volume lah basically
ah
okay
okay
for all the courses eh
mmhmm mmhmm
okay
um information security
mmhmm ya with honours
wait how can you apply for only two courses they asked for like six seven courses what
huh seriously
uh huh I think it was six leh
uh huh
you thought portfolio was
the heck okay
ah okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
interest
ya like a reference lah
oh okay
oh okay
ya
what was the what was the second course
what was
ya
no that was no the one that with the portfolio what was it
mm oh okay okay
not bad lah ah sia lah if only hmm if only you were
ya I know right then you'll be stressing out like me also
uh huh ya
mmhmm
ah
oh
I I applied for on err twenty seventeen eh no twenty eighteen or twenty nineteen
eh
ya but then the thing is um
I applied too late like I applied in march also
so I was too late for the for everything so uh there was no slots for me lah
then on the twenty nineteen I applied again and then they asked for a video interview
and then after that the video interview then got the
mass interview like a group interview
ya ya ya but the video interview I got tell you or not the story before
ah
they were like okay so the video they were giving me instructions lah it was like oh video interview is prerecorded
so that means it's not live
questions
then they send it over to me
then
ya ya
yes yes ya that type of thing ah
ya so the other day right um I I had that lah
and then after that one of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
err out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like oh shit
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
I realised that there's this this this lah and have done
this this this in the past and also uh I have some experience with it okay next question
err what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list err I realised that there's maths lah
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths lah that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview lah
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview um it was err
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this err to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like ah then I was talking with my group my lah then I was like eh
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here sia going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know ah maybe ah
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home huh
ya and then like ah okay that's all I was like ah okay I expected something a bit more difficult lah
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the uh the email
saying whether you have passed or not lah like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now lah
mm okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like eh shit I never received any email sia
ah ah okay because right
is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort lah
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview eh our video presentation how was it
all all that thing lah
ya that's that's how I did it lah I don't know maybe because
but then last year
there wasn't be any COVID yet right
ya so I don't know maybe maybe because you applied too late lah honestly
no no no
okay
mm
uh huh
ya
mmhmm
mm ya ya
mmhmm
oh so you are saying that like
so is that what you're trying to say
oh okay lah
mmhmm
ah okay
okay
mm but what type of jobs are you applying for that's the question
okay
mm ya
no but all these all these honestly right all these like
they ask for like two three years of experience right
okay
uh huh
uh err ya
mmhmm

like for example dealing with your life lah you don't have to deal with a lot of life things that are that are outside of the what
just have to deal with okay and then the rest of the time just flies
that is still under lah hello
why he want to you know he want to up rank a bit ah

mmhmm
eh eh
oi don't like that lah
ya loh then I don't know I just then uh the other day my I met up with my my officer from my unit
ya lah then because he also I have to meet him soon because
to me it's unheard of ah okay when you an okay then after that when you want to
eh ultraboost is for casual this one is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation lah so I had this ah
I had this lake concept method the other time
and err I will I couldn't get it to work lah even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax lah
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
sia lah
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course lah comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
two thirty
no lah my friends they don't mind me leaving the house
but
that type of thing you know
a'ah sia
I tell you it's like oh goodness

ah okay
I mean like I guess
a lot of them are like they all look the same you know they kinda
they have the long black hair then they all they're all sponsored by like Shopee and
ya I don't know
that's true
ah
how much is fifteen thousand yen in
it's the same it's fifty thousand dollars
oh
Apex players
I mean I just think it's
like do the controls and stuff then I was quite new to the game then he ask me come nearer then I'm like okay I'll come nearer then he said it'll come a bit nearer nearer nearer then I'm like okay I'll come a bit nearer then you know he taunt kill me which is basically like you you take like he like he pressed Q and then it makes your character do something cool and then it kills you so he stabbed an arrow up my body and then I flopped and a died ya
no no no no no ya but
basically
ya that's my experience I guess after that
did I I think
no it makes sense
it's pretty normal lah I think to be honest the only reason why my like
controller ya then he would we would just play like Street Fighter lah or like Super Mario and stuff then he will lend me his game boy then I started playing Final Fantasy when I was like six but you know like at that age you don't even understand what's going on so I wasn't really good at Final Fantasy lah I didn't understand the strategy then like until this year also I don't like strategy games ya but then cause of that like I got used to the controls like from a early age I guess then on top of that I used to do sports like you know in primary school uh like I used to be from floorball ya you know cause I did ya you know I was team captain also like but that's just because the rest of the team didn't care but that's besides the point then
err I guess cause of all of that my hand eye coordination got
oh I I played I played COD like a long time ago cause it got boring it's just you refresh the round then after that you like shoot people and then it's like the same cycle ya so now I play PUBG ya with riti but I used to play PUBG in secondary school also it was uh like cause the other girls in class they didn't really play games then I was I was uh
one of the girls or like there was another girl also lah like I think shahira used to play games a lot also but basically she and I
would sometimes play with like the guys in class cause my classes
B ya
ah ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya the Switch is sort of like a
Taken oh Taken is a pretty good game though I my brother had a then his he had like a bunch of games I'm not sure if they were pirated or not cause like he pirates a lot of stuff not even gonna lie like even my games on my were pirated I think ya but he had like ben ten and like some other few games but I don't I don't remember the rest ya but ya I really I really really like the just because it was so easy to bring around you know ya
basically more or less ah
then
oh shit
ya ya ya correct correct correct
funny story right I the first time I saw Mortal Kombat was when I was like
my first sign of childhood trauma
but
I think so I think he's like the main character in one of them or is it all of them I don't even remember the plot to be honest
mmhmm
ya actually I stopped playing that Tetris game I think cause I got I got
bored of the loading screen cause like to wait for a new match is quite sometime right
quite long right ya so I think I stop playing that I was thinking about getting smashed
kan cause I think
march like it was the start of circuit breaker I think ya so like around march then it's the
I haven't gotten it at all they haven't even confirm no they confirmed my order already but then they never like updated me after that aku rasa dia orang terlupa like I really feel like they forgot about my order but then I like I really keep meaning to email them I always forget in fact I've already ordered another album and I already got that album but like I still don't have the previous album that I ordered
ya so I need to
email them about it cause now they have my thirty dollars
uh it's on Carousell but then like they're an official website they're they're not sketchy lah to be honest they're like quite well-known it's house of K-pop
like email them I guess I don't I don't even know what I should say what should I write in my email
ya they gave me the order number ya
mm I guess so
no no no the signed one got cancelled cause that time two members went on hiatus ya I didn't I ended up not buying that one
ya
that one I only got
I decided to buy two normal versions
ya then I just pre-ordered it orh ya
something
I know right it's so like you kind of question like what they actually do in the army and then like you know sometimes they get the idols to perform also inside the army it's quite entertaining though especially when they like come together oh it's super entertaining
ya ya ya I think so
I don't know maybe
ya
I don't know it's very weird also it's very weird to think that like our friends are going to go to I have some people enlisting in like I have some friends enlisting in
uh
like
what is it they ya they get to get discharged earlier but still it's kinda sad then I can only see them on weekends ya
mm but my closest guy friends haven't gotten it yet though know like set lin hasn't
gotten it
ya ya ya maybe he'll get for april or something maybe that's why they haven't sent out I don't know I don't know how works
forgot his name one of the malay the one that
used to that you saw at Don Don Donki
do you do you know
ah ya ya ya him he and
saz were in what is it called ah infantry in or something ya then that one also is quite
I think it's it's like something like commando but I I don't know what's the difference ah
then you know saz also was like a medic sort of like he he he was really good at doing first aid and stuff then back then when we were doing part time he will explain to me like what to do with different people like for different injuries what you should do what
methods to apply or something ya infant is like the man
orh is it
I don't know I just watch war movies and I watch people die and I I don't really know the like the specifics
ya ya
then they don't have
I think
what I read about was that japan back then lah don't know if it's still like that now like in history um they really train on mental resilience and then like they would they really drive the nationalism into like the soldiers so that's why
like the
uh what do you call it the the one that the people that sacrificed themselves in the warplanes
I think so ya ya then like those pilots they were willing they knew that they were gonna die but they willingly volunteered themselves to like drive drive the plane into the ships ya like because they at the back of the heads they're like yes I would I would love to die for my country cause like for them it's like I think of honour I guess I think singaporean culture doesn't really have that but japanese people I think korean people also ah they are very strong about their honour then like that's even that's also why they taught soldiers how to commit seppuku
ya it's like you start from the right then you left then you go up then like your guts will literally spill out of you ya uh I remember after the war I think after certain battles lah if they lost right they would just commit seppuku and die
ya can you imagine that like
you are so devoted to your country to the point where you would rather die than just
ya than just lose the war it's it's quite intense
ya in general cause I watch so many war movies right war was just terrible man it was terrible for everyone and
a lot of people
I think the saddest parts are when
people die not even cause they were fighting but they were they just got like diseases and stuff I I was watching this story atonement ya then the guy uh
are you are you gonna watch the movie
okay well then the guy died of
septicaemia or something which is basically when like you have a wound then uh there's like bacteria and it infects your wound and then like basically you just
um I don't know ah it just
ya then because of that they just can't breathe or stuff or something ya
ya so he died like that and he died on the last like before the last ship back home
ya it it was really sad lah so when he died and then the wife not the wife but like the girlfriend I guess
um she died too but it was because of
no it was cause of a bombing and then she tried to hide in a train station but cause of the bombing I think it burst some pipe or something and then the whole train station got flooded
ya so that's how she died then so they both died before they met each other again
ya it was a really it was pretty sad lah but I didn't I didn't cry that much I think cause
that wasn't the main message of the story ya but it was pretty sad
it's so realistic to the point where it's not it's not like you know you're not like watching a movie anymore it's like you're really there so that's why it really broke my heart
that's why and he was really trying his best to take care of the sister you know then it's just suay ah the sister ended up dying of malnutrition
a'ah a'ah a'ah
it's not even not even an entree
it happened in nineteen forty two-ish ya
um I think
my mother's generation is like one of the last few
to have experienced effects of the war
a'ah
then um
I think
uh like
and she did she barely took anything with her I think he just took like
some clothes then like her money lor then she just came to singapore I mean
I don't know I don't know how they got the house but ya
it was mm
before the war I think
it was ya it was like a year or two years before the war
that's why I'm glad I'm not though ya
ah ya ya ya it's they they don't even like to acknowledge it lah to be honest and then they I think everyone knows already lah but like they put a lot of money into giving japan this new image and then like you know just showing off their culture and everything ya
but
I think so the magnitude of nine or something ya then my mum was like oh this is
ya it's like karma for what they did during the japanese occupation
ya like I mean sure I guess whatever you believe in but it's still a bit insensitive to say it while it's happening
ya ya correct correct
mm
mm
mm I was watching unsolved mysteries on netflix then they were talking about this one town there also got affected by the
err what do you call it the tsunami ya then um it washed away a lot of people basically and a lot of people that I think in that region alone fifteen thousand people died ya and it wasn't a big town it was maybe their population was
like they didn't know where to go cause they didn't know that they died cause it was all so sudden right then especially taxi drivers whenever they were driving around right err like usually nighttime they will find people who are just like in the middle of nowhere then they need to go they want to go back into the town where the tsunami happen
then like
they will stop
near the town then when they turn back the person is not there anymore
ya
something like that it's it's I guess it's kind of a spin off version of buddhism not not to say it's like not to be disrespectful it's just that it's something like that ya
uh huh
ah ah ah
ya
ah ya it was in
in two thousand three ya ya
I
like the whole
I don't know how I don't know what you call it I guess town ya and after that a lot of people have like trauma of just even showering
a lot of people lost their my parents their grandparents then you know like if even like you can't even retrieve
your
serious
like he got pulled in to the water ya then I think I don't know ah maybe the mother ran in after him a
ya but I know that I think they died ya
it's pretty sad lah that's why it's quite fortunate that we live in singapore like okay there are a lot of cons also but at least we don't we really are quite safe from
uh natural disasters
ya
ah
that's so creepy
eww
there's like similar stories about this in the basically like they people move into new houses right then you know houses in the are freaking huge like if you watch renovation stories right dude their basements are the size of like a flat you know and that's just one floor and it's the bottom floor so their attics they also have like attics and stuff then got stories of people they just move in and then they hear like like I don't know lah footsteps around the house right then usually I think people would usually think like a ghost or something then but then they they wouldn't believe it lah so they think oh maybe just the pipes or something but then people find out that there are like people living in their attics and when they're not awake or something they'll go down and then they'll eat from their fridge or something then they'll go back up into the attic to hide ya then I remember one girl she was showering or something then she heard the person climb down ya then I don't know ah I don't know how it happened but she managed to call the police then the police arrested the guy
ya then I think the guy was living in her attic for what ah year ya a year since she moved in and she didn't notice at all like that's so creepy I cannot imagine having just this random person
in your house like don't don't even know what he's doing
actually ya actually ya ya ya ya ya but in a more
ya less um murdery kind of way
it's so insane I cannot stand away you can do you know what what higher speed said I cannot sit cross country and no lah I mean
I don't know lah I mean
mm I guess has to do with like their amendments and stuff ya
mm
ya I can't imagine people our age voting a lot of people I know didn't even keep up with the
like parties and stuff ya I mean it's not bad lah it's just that it's not necessary you know I think it will only work in
countries like america I kings or like okay lah maybe it will only work for work in favour for her talent like other workers party basically any party that's not P P
I guess or like okay lah maybe it will only work for work in favour for the I don't know worker's party basically any party that's not
cause
mm
I think
then they moved to a zone
that was under
was it a worker's party or another party lah like you can tell that the residents residences are different like the way they are decorated ah like it's very different and then I think it's like the one
mm
true
I don't know I mean my friend is taking political science now so by the time I can vote I'm just I'm just gonna ask everything then I'll follow her her guidance we live in the same also like she lives what
two blocks away from me ya so I'm just gonna trust her instinct
it is it is ya actually got her she did she got her first essay back already she did really well she most people she said most people only got a B for that paper then she got then only three people like their professor gave an A then she got an A minus then she was so happy I'm so proud of her
I think it was about karl marx and just his communism idea ya
ya no really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had to write a whole essay about it like two thousand words
ya
ah but nah uni sounds so exciting can't wait to do stuff like that
dude I cannot believe it and she's like the one of the youngest ah ya
like some went to uh most of them went to ah like some into ireland like dublin ya then some of them went to australia some of them went to the ya
ah ya
ya exactly like you can't even guarantee that you'll get into the olympics
like ugh

it was so cold in the morning
then then second day is it you all three days you just relax at the hotel
mm
oh
oh okay

mm
oh so when you went it's just messy lah is it
ah nothing much

it's nice to go out with your family and staycay lah
what
mm
yeh so one night is you go weekday one night already what five hundred ah no
wah so expensive
oof

this staycay in Singapore quite fun lah especially when you go with family or friends
yeah
eh why you never apply for like Coffee Bean
then
then
oh never got reply ah
oo my friend got Coffee Bean then I like uh I hear I hear her pay like I wanna work there too
if you reach a certain amount of hours per week you get ten dollar per hour but I think she might hear wrong lah she might hear wrong what that's why I scared
yeah but okay lah she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
November oh my god this week got like tick-tock September October you got like nearly two months man
oh very long eh
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find what you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
kan
mm
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years eh err like at least a year experience then I'm like I haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much sia
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it I never check like jobs right now
mm
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play Among Us
you know there's this game called Among Us
can ask like
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but I cannot lie I can't I I cannot lie everytime I lie they like okay it's Nisha it's Nisha I'm like oh no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
mm
mm
mm
yeah
mm
mm
what
you can hide the body
wah
I didn't know you can hide the body wah I should I should try
mm
then so many people there right I just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then I just keep quiet
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games eh ya
is it all meat or is it just err beef
wah
I mean I know I know you can but you just prefer not to right
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
mm mm mm
I was trying to make sense of your sentence then I'm like uh err huh
yeah
mmhmm
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
mm
they're waiting for you
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes I also like that lah but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan lah
hmm
mm
mm
yeah that's why it's like it's worse I mean would they like it when when I say that oh we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
then then that's why that's why I keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
mm
mm
yeah
eh
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
wah
then next week just take bus all the way later I like I don't really
yeah I'm your guinea pig now ah
and then Natalie idea did you read Natalie's the that thing
I I did the survey but I didn't see the point of having one
I think
I think that will be more useful lah in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind I think that will be more helpful if they research in that lah
mm
mm
mm
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi kan
um I mean hmm continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first ah
mm
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help what
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
uh mm
yeah the yeah
yeah uh huh
mm
mm
yeah like I feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled lah
convenience right
mm
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know err not one maybe like some it's very sad lah
mm
yeah
have you heard
I mean I I wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in California is it California or Oregon ah
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay lah you want do gender reveal party it's okay I think I think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer lah that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah lah
really
oh man you should ask cause I think it will damn funny
I didn't know
hmm
oh boy is a girl joke lah
rated
mm
yeah it's like so isn't it like betting like you betting is actually a betting it's like just a party kind of thing it's like a party idea
a blessing right
hmm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah man funny lah
my own shift yeah
I only serve what two customer
I was so I was like so zoned out yesterday cause it was so quiet I like I want a customer but I also don't really want a customer to come in
I mean like I have to clean the shop still but then like I just sit there do nothing eh
literally like zoned out eh it was very funny by myself in the shop
I think it was very funny yesterday
I mean Kelly still got her mum hopefully her mum will help her
mm
mm
no I was like you you you I was like so shocked
are you sure are you sure it's not Andrew cause I also I also I thought it was bought
okay I thought it was bought then I was like okay maybe it's a bought cake then until Andrew asked me ah Nisha do you think it's a bought cake or did you think someone make it I'm like huh
Ethelene and Kelly I was so shocked
I mean I mean I it's obvious that it was her cause she's the one who bought the cake to my house right cause if she was trying to hide the damn box behind her back I cannot see when she entered the house and I'm like okay maybe she buy the cake
and then I'm like
but my family said a bit dry but I don't care whether dry or not I care for the frosting the the the the cream cause some I don't really like whipped cream kan
yeah
yeah
mmhmm
mm mm yeah yeah yeah that's why I don't really like it also yeah
this is
I was like oh I want more of this whipped cream right here it was so good it was so pretty also like wow Kelly this such a fantastic job
then she suddenly come out with like that everyone was like so shook eh
I heard they were scared that I would buy a cake
mm

mm
Z
mm
Z

alright alright
few walks away so it's not really much of a big distance for us to cover
ya the kampung with the malays ya that place
no lah I think for them maybe is about
okay so six get already then after that we err
err until six thirty five then
yes
censored ya so sulaiman was there to pee lah then after that err not long after that lah my turn my turn because for us there's nothing much to do so all we do is go up there
drink lots of water so sulaiman will have a sweeter taste because he
drank lemon tea I I brought my dasani and then we just drink drink drink and for sulaiman he only peed once I peed
enjoy the enjoy
ya
that's life that's life
I see I see so so
sorry
ah
ah
uh huh
mm mm
seven ah ah mm
mm mm
pulau ketam lah
so you mean basically the uncle brought you from changi all the way to pulau ketam
so you mean to the jetty then taxi van mm
ya lah cause the way you say was like did I did I skip the taxi thing or like
ah
mmhmm
mm seriously
how sia
like saw sia
aduh aduh okay so the crabs err
ah
no fish no crab ah ah ah
mm mm mm mm mm
eh eh ah okay
wah same man wan five give me high five
mm okay alright so this wan one ah ah
supper Milo
one of a kind
wait the context this is taking place at where again
ah
mm mm uh uh
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
ah okay but three mm okay
okay carry on carry on
mm
mm mm
mm
mm mm
ah
ah ah I need to remember but ya mmhmm
mm
daring daring
mm mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ish ish mm mmhmm mmhmm
ish ish of course not nice
three three testing ah sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see ah uh huh ah
oh the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of pulau ketam from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in lah maybe a place I've never been in before lah
oo that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to punggol to already
orh aduh so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
oh here comes the big one and uh instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your pulau ubin story thank you so almost for sharing
err time check this one I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually err after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot lah I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit lah ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
lah kan lah kan eh yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months ah ah
okay so for now the same thing lah just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for err I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being err more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on lah
I think slowly lah eh because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed lah I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more lah ya so just err pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
err with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then inshallah when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck lah then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that err it's just whether or not approve or not if approve I alhamdullilah I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it lah if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application lah
err wah cannot I cannot think that means a lot already lah
err
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've err sent for has been
err civil service err healthcare err cleaning err
around those lah is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call lah
ya lah so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
the rejection is the best part ah silence which is the most annoying part because technically eh by right the most professional way for is
at caldecott area there err more of central macritchie lah macritchie reservoir ah so it's there
then err then
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that err we'll just keep in touch err within the week we'll call you back
err with every passing day err when the doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish lah like are you just playing my feelings want to play my feelings ah playing my heart
ah
so
so okay so basically err
then
ya so so that's the story lah the middle person err
err eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
my number to this err communications officer lah then err after that
is fandi ahmad fandi ahmad
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment lah so okay err I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
then mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
you know because for my for me err the the thing is me and this err officer
eh not call lah Whatsapp me say eh sorry shazwan we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
err so the officer said
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say lah err it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya
ya lah so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
that's why mm yes mm
the video lah kan the video
uh
mm mm mm ya
ah aduh
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense lah because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
mm mm mm
mm
mmhmm mm mm mm
err no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings err time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
err the fishing ah the fishing mine in the beginning right we already talk so that's why we like awkward a bit now now still awkward lah cause now we talking to you it's just
today is not we today we cannot say
err we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning oh damn
so yes err these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but hey you are a
listener
best per month pe not like the whole internship
yes uh
uh uh okay
ah okay okay highest
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
ah
mm mm
is it is it mm mm
then alamak
mm mm
then you you you the man you lead my country
I don't need to worry too much you you you do your thing I do mine
so hopefully for you listeners out there I don't even know if you will listen or use it straight to the machine the will have to understand cause if they have to understand man eh
mm mm mmhmm
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya lah we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step lah like we said as malay
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the mat-mat accent
but the mat-mat accent but I think
it's nothing is not like the plastic moved by itself or anything yes alright okay
it's too far you carry on you want no problem no problem you take your time
uh huh basically Foodpanda basically Deliveroo
Grab Foodpanda ah decent lah this kind of job ah
ah mm mm
mm
uh huh
if you if you not malay lah if if you really really do the extra step
your outstanding mm
around there yes
ah ah ah
mm mm mm ya lah ya lah
ya lah interview mm mm mm
ya
mm so if you were to times four for the month is one K your internship
but this time you can enjoy what you do cause your internship you have to listen to people say make changes but for you you make the change you go from one place deliver the food to the other
mm per day lah
mm
speaking about fitness I actually went on a hike two weeks ago
yes yes no no further no
I don't know how to say but I feel like it's further
close change the last part
I walk from my house I cut through bedok I reach east coast park I walk along the whole east coast park reach the gardens by the bay
from east coast to marina barrage two hours
because
you start from tekong around the area tekong and then you walk that extra mile tampines to here is your other one and a half hours
that's why it's long just join lah that's why I buy this thing
might as well park my

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
uh it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
ah kids also starting school soon
um
when
march eh eh march april
I I think so
because uh now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and uh we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and uh rules like uh have lax a bit lah
so I think they would allow us to do to uh the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably uh direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing uh quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of uh the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should err you know
find some I uh
find the to get some quotation
what is err
what is your uh your your ideas for the renovation
uh minimalist
oh I
uh
I think open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
uh
ah
you are my uh private
cook
ya uh I will buy all the ingredient
and then uh I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter um
you want a you want to put like a uh you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
uh the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because ah ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better lah because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and uh moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food lah
ya
and then
ya
uh
to to uh depends on uh
mm
kan ah
mm ya I I think you you think that concept
err I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack uh uh the what you call that the the wall there
err
and then you uh you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
oh okay lah
ya lah
you think because uh Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the uh ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
mm
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
uh multiple attempt to
uh kill them
they uh they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
uh it uh spraying the the lizard repellents uh spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too lah the our our house here I think
uh the it's there's a lot of uh lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient ah even though I've tried to to to hit them ah is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
oh my god so uh I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
ah
err
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time lah it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners uh I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity lah it's a it's a need lah more of a need
necessity because everything has err you know
wears down you know
and uh our our kitchen looks quite dirty and uh rundown and uh
our our the uh you call it the flooring starts to uh wears down
ah ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and uh they feature a few uh lah but uh so far three D contractors uh in terms of
the the the outcome ah it it it suits our taste ah
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
eh very nice lah we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but uh ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that uh
not not not the sink ah kitchen tap
quite a few lah and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus oh one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the ah
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
aiya
I don't know lah it's both it is both uh frustrating and funny at the same time eh
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then err
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
uh
self guilt lah I think so I don't know lah
ya
cement
oh
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship lah
ya
ya the was
uh ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him lah probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain oh ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery lah but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
mm ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare lah how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how lah
which one we we want to choose
ah
so
mm
ya
major major lah
mm
mm
kan
one uh so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package ah
oh
ya
kan might as well kan
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
mm
mm mm
okay lah thousand five ah eh
so I think ya lah
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in uh uh in the future we have uh
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
ah
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring ah
I think that one is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that one the the more expensive one
mm
but have to
you have to ya lah everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the the budget can consider lah I think that one's quite expensive is around
wah but I find it like very good leh
and it's wireless
mm
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
uh brands uh
uh have that those type of uh two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that one very good ah uh I think
can can consider lah if we have the means
but now we aiya we see how for now we just use manually first ah
use the sucking mop ah
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
uh sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive ah
ya that one really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence ah because like I told you earlier on
err ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence lah
ya
mm
the specific uh ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
ah ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well lah
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
mm
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally lah ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya lah like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
mm
mm
uh I think this saturday we we settle uh akid's uh school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare akid uh school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
uh the the the the renovation ah
mm so actually we K we we need to ya lah we ours we we are the one who should
direct them oh we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration ah
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but ah ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

I want to watch the bridge curse
you don't want to watch
no lah it's it's about it's about the bridge and the curse on the bridge
no meh
is the bridge curse
ya lah ya lah
we watch intruder

I'm pretty sure
no meh
they they go to the site and then they record lah
what's so hard
it's not
wait
no lah it's before the lockdown what
a'ah
okay
mmhmm
and then
I think
no I think the one year is
mm if let's say they had one year right they'll be done like april
then the rest of the time is going to be to editing ya
I know
yes
like mulan they pushed back mulan what
right
no
no the girl cannot go and fight
ya she wants to fight
no
oh my god did you even watch the the first show
you never watched mulan
no
you know do you know why mulan do you know why mulan went into the war
it's because the dad was supposed to go
no the dad is sick
that's why what mulan you watch
no
mmhmm
me personally I won't but mulan
because they have no choice
if mulan doesn't go the dad will have to go did you see the fighting scene
the one where the dad was trying to do the sword and then the dad fall no right you never watch right
so you
so so technically you don't have a say
let's talk about a different movie
she didn't want to go for the war
she's a woman
no woman cannot go
yes
okay let me break it down for you okay so technically
and then after that the dad was recruited
to get in a war and the dad is forced to the dad has to go if not the whole family will die
that's just the rule back then
all the girls don't need to go all the men every in every family one of the man need to go
did you even watch the movie I don't think you watched the movie
if you watched before you won't ask me all these questions
she she got she got shot
can we talk about another show
no you're getting it all wrong oh my god you you don't know your you don't know the cultural significance
ya because she got shot
and then she had to be treated
the the wu
hans the hans
let's talk about something else
I don't want to talk about the show already
how about aladdin let's talk about aladdin

so close
how about aladdin why don't you make me understand aladdin
I cannot talk to someone
who really don't know anything
ya that's all
okay how about how about let us end it
so mulan
went to the war when she's not supposed to and then she got caught
because
err every every man in every family need to go to the war
yes
even though
uh huh ya ya ya
yes
yes
and then this was back in the days where the woman
where all the women need to give their main role is just to give birth

wah
so annoying
mm why don't you explain to me the concept of aladdin
cause what
you're not supposed to drink water

smart for me
I always do my work last minute
what the teacher teacher give me so many work to do
okay but I oh anyways I studied as much as I can and I got the good results that I wanted so
what
mm I think I cannot lah I remember when I was in primary school
the moment they stress me about studies I cannot function any more
ya
mm ya kind of mine wasn't give up I just cannot function
no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because kan
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day what
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous uh homework lah
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no meh
it's like
okay for example eh you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember what
until now I still do that
ah lah primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
same lah
ah think you know you are only one year older than me
so the timing is about the same
just saying
the changes is after me
what born
two thousand one
mmhmm
I don't like that let me surely you are young
oh I thought is
oh oh I thought the same ah lah sorry ah lah sorry
you just now say you talk enough my turn I okay lah you talk lah you talk
I just listen lah
faster give me something else to do
so annoying
ha so what I want to say see lah I forget already
oh I remember P one I was the teacher's pet
ya
but I think
a'ah cause I got bullied in P one
so I became the teacher's pet
the teacher just dote on you
dote on you
uh huh
I guess
sure
ya but everyone
no
like I remember she
she was my favourite teacher miss lee
cause I
okay okay okay
oh ya sure
anyways
she always like I think cause I got bullied a lot by these three people in my class
so she always took me to the staff room you know the staff room in primary school kan is out of bounds
ya but then she always take me in there and then I sit there at her desk go watch movies with her
ya
because in recess I think every every recess they always bully me
I can't remember lah but I remember got one time I sprayed water on my friend also
she sounds like me eh
mmhmm
mm
oh she throw there
ya
mm
mm
why
what's wrong with that
oh oops I also didn't think of that
it's not worry meh
I don't think that bottle is going to oh from eighth level ya ya ya oh ya ya ya ya
no
mm
ya ya
mm then after that
huh
I don't know I okay let's let's just end it I was a devil baby

so I just joined it

how to say I don't think I want to relive my secondary school live
cause so much drama
oh
sometimes I was the middle actually it's hard to say lah there was this one big drama I think in sec four
I wasn't I wasn't in any of the side
but then I didn't I really didn't like it
ya
how to say
not the whole cohort lah but the whole
ya the whole
mm because we were the leaders what
like in sec four we're already leading the whole team
and then after that
got drama lah and then I was just like
ya and something that I wouldn't do

oh it's okay um jurong and woodlands not very near also what
oh what bus was it ah
mm
not bad I don't think I ever took one eight seven before sia
like the only bus I will take
to go jurong is eh
I don't know honestly I don't know
um yeah I mean I go to school like I study in jurong right okay technically not jurong lah clementi
but usually like I take and bus
but then there isn't like a direct bus to my school so that kind of sucks yeah
ah yeah correct I take the train from marsiling
to clementi then I take one eight four
yeah it's pretty tiring honestly everytime I sit I get so annoyed because like there's so many people on the bus and they're all just squeezing to get a seat ugh
yeah especially like before COVID right at least now with COVID everyone like social distance and the bus isn't so crowded right but like
honestly like I also now everytime I went to school
I'm kind of glad now that it's not so crowded but I do hate the fact that COVID exists
I feel like oh it's just so tiring you take more energy trying to breathe then like
walking around or running around
yeah honestly like our friendship is damn low maintenance ah like we took
we haven't been out with each other in like what a year
like honestly the last time we went out that was memorable was us going to LANY
and that was fun I'm quite upset that this year there's no more concerts
um
all because of COVID is really damn irritating especially when it comes to like
school oh yeah you know I was supposed to go on a holiday in june to New Zealand
like dude that's one of the best countries
ever eh like honestly but we couldn't even go and the thing is
hey loser
mm
oh my god I miss malaysia Ramly burger
yeah like the vibes at night is just different like last time ah when me and my dad
when we went there when me and my whole family used to go right then my dad will always go to this one particular guy his name was like azan or something
we can't even go there and the thing is we don't even know if he still has a business which is so sad
some people like they their only form of income is like all these businesses
but honestly if you think about it right if I stay in malaysia I'll be having so much fun right now
because like malaysia is so big you can already travel from jurong jurong eh
johor bahru to and where can we go in singapore jurong to tampines
like what the heck so boring
I thought like the best part of living in malaysia would be because like you can go from one place to another
but that's not the case
mm
what
what so the police like
hmm
yeah honestly indonesians have the funniest humour from what I see on Twitter they always say like
when usually people have the worst humour like if somebody go to their house and scare them they would like laugh and stuff right
cause the COVID situation is not so bad but I still miss school
like ugh it's so hard to focus in class you know because it's all online
but I have one exam coming this thursday and I'm so scared cause I have barely studied
yeah I was thinking that exams would be online which would suck
you must go to campus but you have like a lot of precautions to follow you must like
key in your temperature like on the school website lah then like you must at the entrance you must show like this specific lanyard thing that you must have to enter the campus and all then ah
so it's like one class per classroom then the exam is there
exam like seriousness of an exam so it's very hard for me to focus like I had an exam a few
like two weeks ago
I don't know just not used to it you know like wearing a mask and then it's just so uncomfortable
for me ah yeah because
I don't know my course don't really have a lot to do with like online stuff or like
so honestly I cannot imagine having the exam on laptop cause I think that would be super stressful but
I don't know I guess you have to experience to know how is your O level preparation going
I I don't know if I read the article correctly I never really read lah I just saw the headlines it's like eh extended
oh right that's true oh I forgot okay anyway
ah fun fact I dropped in sec three
cause I sucked at I was so bad at it
and the thing is it's ironic cause you know how they say malays can't do math right
yeah but then I did well for maths but I can't do well for which is damn funny honestly
actually that's true I wonder is like because all my friends right they say they are more motivated at home
and your school life is hard because you are in the same place what at least last time like
so hopefully the bell curve isn't higher only everyone is faces situation as you like the oh I cannot study I'm stress kind of thing
but I don't know I wouldn't want to go through O levels ever again
I always tell myself like oh I'm going to be better I really hope so
and like
yeah
hais I just want COVID to be over it has caused so many problems
hopefully
oh well yesterday ah like I said I always stay at home right so basically yesterday I was staying at home but mostly I was studying
um
since I'm so used to right I stopped writing physical notes
and like honestly I find that it helps me to be more productive
so in a way I think
it did help me overall like
realise what studying methods help me more
so that's basically what I did yesterday how about you
mm
a'ah
um malayan council eh what you eat there
honestly I don't know I haven't gone to like arab street in so long and I just like
I miss the atmosphere that it was before COVID you know
first time we ever went we were like so surprised by the prices like
malayan council legit like damn expensive but I think like
it's like quite serata yeah it's like the
price of the food and the taste of the food and the quality it's all matches up quite well lah it's just that
I don't know I just feel like it's a food that you eat every once in a while you know
no I've never tried before what does it um what does it eh what does it sell
wow that one sounds nice eh honestly I love Indomie
Indomie is so good must be you can't go wrong with Maggi so basically like indobowl just sells like
let's just say how to say high quality indomie is it
but I think like recently I went there like
well honestly
like I keep using this app called fast jobs and I like tried to find all these different different
um positions and the thing is they always say like oh urgent hiring
you say that it's urgent you say that you need people but why do you like not get back to people I don't understand
I think I applied for over like what twenty jobs already and like most didn't get back to me
honestly my last few
like jobs that I've applied for was like Starbucks Coffee Bean like to be honest
if I do get the job I get better at it you know that kind of thing how about you what kind of jobs did you apply for
they never properly advertise what will be in need for the job
I myself don't like it also
like job postings and all but it's like okay
look through every single one I apply for like ten
why do you post the job if like you're not going to get back to people you know I know you're busy and all but the least you can do is like
mm
it's like I applied for Bath and Body Works recently
then they said like we'll get back to you in a week if you're shortlisted
why if I'm shortlisted what if I don't get the job can you at least tell me also because like
but then it's just like really just waiting and waiting and waiting and obviously you don't want to like
make things harder for yourself by applying for other jobs or waiting for another job to get back to you
so I understand your frustration lah like do I apply for this
but like what if the other job accepts me then I cannot take this job
and then it will just make their lives harder
but they don't even think about us they don't even tell us
like honestly I would prefer getting a you're rejected letter rather than just like nothing at all you know
I rather like also know why I didn't get the job that kind of thing it would be nice to know
so that like you can improve yourself and stuff like that but
I don't know how the working world works cause I'm only eighteen but I guess we'll see in the future
hopefully honestly like during this like you know like circuit breaker period
I honestly ordered a lot of things online because like honestly I thought about it I thought like
okay once COVID ends I can get a job and my holidays start it will be so easy for me to like
pay back all the money that I wasted during the holidays
but no I got it all wrong I thought COVID
COVID is still here and it's like
so it's like all these new clothes that I wear for what honestly
mm mm
yeah honestly like when the virus started in china I was like damn that is disgusting
I was thinking that oh they already contained it what like it was from wuhan and like they already closed up wuhan and everything and I thought that it wouldn't like suddenly
like everything happened so fast like we were just living our life as per normal
like of course it won't hit singapore
how to say ungrateful for their position they are the biggest they are like
one of the biggest country in the world but like
their management is so bad like look at their president it's a stupid idiot named donald trump
mm
hmm
you will look up your president what right
because technically like so many people voted him in to the office and all and like
and it's like
the mayors even have to step in just to uh make up for his mistakes like he should know that as a president
he has a lot of power and like everything he says will be taken seriously right everybody no matter how dumb or stupid like they are
it's just like normal to listen to your president what because they are like the head like in power and all so yeah
mm mm
mmhmm
hmm
there are still people who are saying that they will vote him for the next election when he has already
proven so many times that he is inadequate for the country
like why you so dumb ugh anyway let's stop talking about this stupid idiot
eh guess who texted me
this guy from like okay okay so
so like you know I'm super bored during school and all
so then like I started using OkCupid
then like I talked to a bunch of guys lah because I think I'm quite pretty
then like this guy
he's not very honestly he's like err tall
then like okay lah like good looking not bad not bad you know
then he damn funny sia then he ask me like stupid stupid malay jokes okay okay wait let me tell you one malay joke
yeah it's stupid right but like he was one of the first few matches that like make me laugh you know
he's like eighteen years old which is my age honestly actually I don't really date guys my age ah
so like yeah honestly we clicked
not bad sia so far like I don't know I'm quite
interested
err oh his name is bukhari
and like honestly that's a super like old school name like honestly I feel like my
but like I don't know he's not bad and he's tall okay ah not like
uh yeah I'm thinking about hudy who is one six three that stupid idiot of a boy
honestly like I'm so upset that he kind of ghosted me
okay I wouldn't say that we were vibing but at least like I was talking to him and he was talking to me and it's just
actually
one day and a few hours honestly if I
think I swipe a lot already sia and I think like my taste
not so picky so like I got like
then like honestly most of them are quite interesting but like most of them just say
hi
yo
like boring seh like can you be more interesting please
drummer name his daughters
I don't know
eh that's quite funny eh I like how he made a joke with your name inside
you know that kind of thing yeah
facts honestly but um
so they like put in more effort to like talk to everybody and stuff
eh wait wait wait wait how is Bumble
oh
swipe then if it works out on each other then match
why got like twenty four hour expiry date all so funny eh
yeah honestly and I'm so sad about malaysia extending their thing
I know we talked about it just now but you just reminded me cause I don't know how many foreigners there are
and I really just want to go to malaysia I want to eat my korean barbeque
three to one conversion rate
ah seh I just miss going there lah I remember like everytime we go we will try this place called dolly dim sum have you tried before
but they have the salted egg yolk dim sum and it's like
it's perfect I swear
mm
oh my god I love pepper lunch so much and I miss pepper lunch
yeah it was damn funny right it was like I think I texted you like we were texting right saying that we were also at the same place or something oh no
like I was on the fourth floor you were like on the third floor at Starbucks kan
why I yeah you talking about wedding reminds me
like honestly I just miss the wedding food and the atmosphere it's so fun like cause you know I'm in a mixed family right
so usually our wedding is like for the
ah like my mum
ah side she loves taking like she loves the indian culture
so it's like yeah we're not mixed per say
but like because like our ancestors like got some
some blood and all so like we also like proclaim lah but actually we're not mixed
full malay like you
I was so lucky that like my aunt she managed to get married this year
in february like right before like COVID became a worser disaster
mmhmm
yeah honestly you know like I saw this one guy you know a son of a peach on Instagram
mm
right honestly I didn't know it was a thing but apparently it is eh
mm mm
I think
you know how like malay families always say like oh it's for your image for our reputation as a family that's not how you should see it pe in the end
like you're marrying someone is like your happiness so everything should go the way that you want it to go you know
I also like in the future like when I get married my mom and dad will be like cool to like break the traditional stereotype and let me do what like I am happy with ah
mm
mm mm
hmm
actually that's true actually that would be goals ah like
then like in the future they ended up having the wedding at the same place at the same day and that thing cause they plan together kan
I
think no got anne hathaway I remember got anne hathaway mm but it was a good movie ah then I always think about it like
wedding book but I find it like a bit tacky lah like imagine if like somebody find then they will judge me you know like she's like eighteen and she has a wedding book
yeah honestly like
to me when I think about the future I always want like to be special you know like
okay you compare like uh prices of cars in singapore to prices of cars in
you can get a car in for like what
like forty thousand and then in singapore the same car will cost like hundred thousand something with C
so it's like I don't know ah like you think about it you can have all these dreams and aspirations but like
so much to think about in the future and I'm honestly very stressed
like I remember I went to Australia and I was in sec one then after that we went to where is it gold coast
then we got to pass by like this
err university university of queensland
then like from then I told myself like oh I'm going to work really hard to like get into a local like an overseas uni
so lonely because now we're so used to like the big family gathering
so it's like really a lot of to think about I just hope that like
in the future you now is now is with like global warming and all
like I'm just scared that like
is there even any world to live for
yeah that's true that's why like I'm always grateful that I live in
singapore but I don't know it's really just a lot to think about in the future and like what is important to you
I don't how I'm going to teach that child malay
you know I'll still want my children to learn and all cause I feel like it's important
later become like you know the swastika language is it
like is it swastika
I forgot what not ah swahili
or something yeah honestly right that language has become obsolete
oh sanskrit sanskrit
al like it's really gone
like nobody even speaks it anymore nobody knows how to write it and that kind of thing so like
so it's like yeah thinking about that kind of scary
mm
mm
mm

okay um
you know I was wondering right
would you rather good looks or a fit body because I see like everybody
everybody especially now because we got like coming up soon
everybody are like they want to train and what not
I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
are good looking then
you lucky ah
cause you because
you will get you will
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
um
okay lah err I mean
make sense oh going off of that
err
because you were saying like oh live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
then like
err
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like um
note notes lah about err extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I err
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
um
the the the
we're so interconnected lah it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good lah
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up um
then
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
in my in my opinion ah
err too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things lah but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
we will be like eh
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion ah I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
err
enough with that deep stuff
ah this one is
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
that's what I mean
any kind of skill lah like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
okay
I feel like
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
err let me go by one to three err first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is um
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
ya
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for lah especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
err
very pumped up very excited
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need lah to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything lah that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like wah all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
wah actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya lah I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally lah I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
um
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
it's like our safe place ah like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was err stress management number two would be to be very good at
err running
then number three I feel would be
um
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I just feel like
aiya
don't bother lah just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more oh yes
anything like anything in the world
you know
you wish for it and it comes that kind
mm okay that's true
anything
uh
hmm
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like wah I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose lah
in that sense
so it would really
ya
so
that's for me
then err
mm oh ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it lah but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool lah in my opinion
ya ya
oh building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both lah so
can be any
I mean you know mine lah mine would probably be batman lah
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
err comic comic batman
is that
err
in my opinion it will be batman lah
ya ya mm
they are labelled as
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
put on you
I mean oh so basically it is that concept of with great ya lah like you said lah with great power comes great responsibility in a sense lah I mean in this sense it'll be
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff lah that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school lah like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones lah
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
ya lah
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like ah
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya mm
mm
what would your ideal day in life be
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
the difference is like like in terms of
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
then
like
training people
err
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
like if you are talking about ideal day
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff lah we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people lah but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like eh setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
ya
but ya
is is is
it's fun lah
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it lah you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete lah that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand lah that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from

mm just rerun of friends and big bang theory
mm not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show leh
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay ah thanks
uh by the way uh what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya lah hopefully something will turn up lah after the after all the application
o
okay lah okay I take note oh ya by the way then that time uh besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix uh what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
oh ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see uh who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated uh hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and raquel finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my ah two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out ah but are you buying anything
eh
oh serious ah are you buying
oh ya then uh alesya belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
huh but azam isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay lah if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase ah
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what oh
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it lah I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true lah degree is important I'll think about it lah
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just uh rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree uh sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in uh in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored lah
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company ah I mean
uh usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he uh when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with uh a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
uh he is under maintenance side and technician uh if I'm not wrong uh under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know lah
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know lah I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as uh prison warden ya uh he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
uh the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace uh at just besides changi prison so
in a way beneficial for him lah don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place ah for him
if I'm not wrong ah
oh uh he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent uh not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they uh they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then uh they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong lah
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years ah that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then uh she told me about the benefit uh when she just join full time they even uh give you uh benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even uh
another friend of mine uh she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new khatib home ya she told me about it
they also provide err you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct lah but and all ya
err adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of uh fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company eh not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that err
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya lah just help me out if I need
fourth december he
uh fourth december ha
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
uh she told me err what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because uh she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated oh she also she also has degree by the way
uh chemical chemical science meaning I think err
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya uh right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while lah ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like jurong island that kind of thing that share more of like
uh exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay lah anyway
my bike what what you mean
mm my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
ah that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
uh tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation oh my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically ah what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now ah ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
um maybe lah I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same lah but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small uh company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me lah
oh ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
uh engineer but ya lah I mean wouldn't uh wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
uh if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay what
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
mmhmm
oh ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
huh I thought it's under your name
uh there are demo too young because
oh
ha chain
chain adjust
oh
alamak
oh that time he ask me err he he asked me that uh how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly lah how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as uh much more than his monthly but I told him lah
I told him ah that time I I hit about uh four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked ah my pay
was higher than him then tell him lah but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him lah the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him lah to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him lah
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure lah because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him lah
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him ah I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it lah
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
err
then he was he was shocked lah I say no lah because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked lah he he he judge but whatever lah I mean
I mean you just want to try try only what then and then I told him lah
like it's all up to individual lah I mean all
I I tell him what all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
uh I told him uh
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face lah
uh was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
roo is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket uh add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable lah because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
oh okay lah maybe I see about that
but okay lah I mean I wouldn't complain already lah I mean as long as the market is good already lah because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
uh now uh based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to hougang mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I uh she she ride but she put under but err bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her lah ah they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me lah what's the logic behind this grab enforcers oh I mean I'm working what but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say lah like
oh is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair what I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that sucks
okay I'll take note lah

mariam
ya
cause I want to make
I want to make brownies but I don't know how
what do you add
flour I put flour baking powder
eh no I don't put baking powder I put sugar the brown sugar

ya that's why
oh eh fadreena

fudge
so let's hear what's what's your tea on her
mm
mm
ya she has a boyfriend
ya the fuck but the the boyfriend quite uh handsome though but then like why are you bringing your boyfriend into this he's not a part of it also
oh
ya but she do two K though I saw I saw
ya but I feel like same
a'ah
ya that's why
if only wah
oh ya by the way you know rachel got new boyfriend already right
ya oh you met him in real life already ah
uh the ex is our age but she looks twenty five
weird lah sia
ya
uh mm true
did you see the shoes that he buy her the three hundred dollar one

do you are you in
ya and his wedding is supposed to be this month leh august eh that's why I was like the fuck
ya
did you see his close friends the latest one
his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one
a movie
mmhmm
for me ah cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you um and is very the timetable very rabak so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy what so I'm like just go for the guy lah he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard sia the guy can could've find someone better what
then
what she want to do now
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex lah
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up sia
then
how did the new guy react
mmhmm
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but I think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
if a lot of guys fight over you oh why like so flower like that
a'ah seh
a'ah seh
but then she not stress meh from all these drama
a'ah

ya he got the trump trump golf club or something oh and you know fun fact when he go visit other countries for like conference all this he will only go to his own golf club
so like so like he earn more lah you get it because when he go to his own that one then the his other like guests like this will also go with him what so more business for him lah in a sense

huh that long meh I think two years ago what no meh
oh four years
ugh rabak
rabak sial
ya keep on every month also got new drama from him

alright
alright mahirah
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
beauty in everyone okay this is a
yes
okay
for me
for me okay aku
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
beauty in a long term woo
mmhmm
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so
mm
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
or jealousy no that it it is really a general relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
mm
go towards the beauty or
oh damn
mm
mmhmm
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are um
which is um it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them lah
ya very subjective
mm
true true but overall selecting friends with with uh with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not uh it's not the right way to do lah I would say
so ya it's not
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
it's not it's unfair what because you should pick someone of uh of of talent of skills instead of beauty
mm
oh yes
pay plays an important role
mm
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
a a partner in life your uh
uh huh
that is true of course of course first ya you will see the appearance one or not
true true true true
me too me too
I think I think
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
mm
mm
mm
what's the point kan
uh I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself err
things like that this little things that will build up um
stressful for some people
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
handsome
ya
if uh can you make me uh beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
oh that means when if I'm beauty
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
yes yes
yes
oh wow
girls or boys
again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
but
ya
really
practical
mm
you can say err comparing eh comparing
uh judgy but
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then uh uh most likely is the
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
this kind of thing is what
it's all lumrah manusia it's all uh human standards
which I think is
this one is is this this kind of thing lah that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
oh dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something eh
mm
mmhmm
functional eh
oh ya
ya competition err competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
there there will be a president there will be uh our manager there will be our the boss
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
usually it's it's gonna be the the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be uh
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
oh my god like
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
uh same like macam
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side err but the the the the negative side about
the look at the people will just support this uh this the group of
based on their
so that is the negative side lah about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way lah but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
mmhmm
true true
uh it's okay err but like eh like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example eh and then you call you wear uh
as time goes by
uh better and more uh
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay um
mm
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
wow okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it mm
true true
oh yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean um ya ya ya
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I would say today this
uh of uh twenty twenty of the twenty first century
it's not um it's because uh as technology evolves we evolve
uh facebook twitter youtube
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a uh company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
uh stage you know what I mean
uh
have the same people that will hold you back
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
fashion wise uh people are now using uh fewer are following the more of the K pop
go jer
mmhmm
value is it popular popularity mm
mmhmm
self love
okay for me
as long as you know
where
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that uh circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find uh someone that really is genuine in your friendship
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or whatever right
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
so go ahead like um move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
yes I I still remember our first our first
so and
sec um
not at for us err we don't we don't we don't go to that direction
so that's a good thing
I I see the like our
no point also lah judging like move on lah move on
our circle of friends ya friendship
yes yes yes correct
yes there is
wah you you got you got the face man
ya you got the face you got the physic
okay mira filzah is the uh actress in malaysia
full package full package
that's a good recipe
you know what I mean
mm
mmhmm
okay role model to me
in my family I I'll have to say my mum lah
my mum is someone that
if some if some if someone that
although that she's tired but she still
ya so role model
neelofa neelofa
like real be and and she's very muslimah also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
ya I take that as a as a
wallah
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
mm mm
mmhmm
those who have that
um like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same lah just human being
ya
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself lah
mm
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no uh okay how about before that we say
err the one thing we regret
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
wow that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
uh the respect that you you're given by society that is more
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
oh message to oh okay okay
oh okay that's good that's good
mm
true
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued lah in this world into serious eh for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
and I have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
have my own uh business or I I'm uh I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever lah bigger title whatever
I mean you shouldn't judge
bad which I don't want that to happen and
that's a wrap
we shall end this okay mahirah see you in the next one
one two three

mm
orh
oh Jetstar
okay

and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of

mm
mm
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook lah so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things lah so I felt like
I didn't know what fish I was supposed to cook with
so I just bought salmon lah then I wanted to cook salmon curry but then

then
after that
um
ya
so then I was like a bit like
um I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have err to go uh with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
um
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
um
mm disrespectful because it's like
like
you know um single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
ah
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said oh weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
um
oh uh don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me

disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see but

I mean hello kitty is japanese
then I like japanese stuff japanese culture
I mean
quirky what do you mean by quirky
uh huh
like your mug ah
oh that's quirky ah
then
so what do you mean by aesthetically pleasing but
no lah anything lah
you know actually I was thinking I've been thinking how how our house will look like
like if if we were to apply for the woodlands one right
as in
we we don't do like a proper
uh like you know those proper interior design stuff that sort of thing we just put whatever wherever that is
make it make it more unique lah like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say uh
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like
and not
you know but then still have a theme
but then like mix and match
ya
like maybe uh
you know how how I say I don't want to buy furniture but I want to make my own furniture
no why
you scared you scared not strong ah
huh
no lah
okay okay okay
I I finish talking already
what
okay like maybe uh I will build my own pond for my turtles
build own cage for our future lovebirds
uh huh
ah decoration you know
you keep like personal touch so what what what what
oh ya
hmm
what what what what what did she say
oh
ah
umah
why
oh
what did
ah
uh huh
and then
ya
chickens are not legal
no because
ya
like cats are also not legal in what
no like according according to the law cats are not allowed in but then the the the law enforcer
don't rely enforce it unless if someone complains
so ya but then for chicken right is ended I think
uh because it's a poultry meat
so like uh like they don't want
things like bird flu and all
spread
so that's why they they don't allow chicken
but then
I think
um because the law is quite new I think like less than ten years I think
somewhere around there
ya
but
I mean same same as
other illegal pets lah that are
it's got some people keep snake and all also what they ask people to adopt snake
ya lah obviously
ya
I
I want a pond for my turtle
then the pond right I want to put back real soil real plant
then they can lay egg over there also
then we got more turtle
then can
breed more I guess or
or you want to give give it away
to people

we were talking about samsung
my mum got a new phone leh

S ten
S ten like

I don't know I had
or iphone
X ah
ya ya ya ya the big the small
ya ya ya
ya ya
ya so I got the big one then she got the small one
I don't know she kaypoh ah
mm mm
samsung also got like that what
the iphone eight
um as in at where carousell ah
oh how much
see see see do you have it with you now no ah
oh then nevermind lah
iphone eight ah
iphone eight I think
a few hundred lah can
ya
ya lah
ya
hmm
nothing
I mumbling I mumbling

eh bro long time no see ah
not that ah actually cause I just got sacked ah by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
err around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful lah cause
I got to travel to different countries ah
among all the countries I would say
uh saudi arabia cause uh it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion lah
err
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
uh finding oh discovering new food there the arabic food was
I would say I would want to go to
spain ah cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
err I want to go to barcelona cause
whole uh football period uh resumes
uh
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
probably can last me for six months ah if I really err spend accordingly and safely lah and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
four thousand wah that I think that's a lot eh for a part-time job
oh I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
uh moving forward
it will be a tough period lah for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
mm
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs lah you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that lah cause as we um you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
err the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important ah in singapore
uh ya I get that a lot lah I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
err it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you lah but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided err you are not doing overtime or what lah
so ya two thousand is not enough lah at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that err or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling lah you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and um the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them eh sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children lah you know maybe
for err
ya I really agree on that lah we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know err
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right wah my house ah I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you lah to ah hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time eh you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
uh this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news lah I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry lah to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree ah there are multiple aspects that um lead to err emotional err depression
or probably um
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right um financial
uh issues I think is the most depressing issue lah
you know cause
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with wah sorry with whatever I'm having lah you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period lah for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think ah I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very uh depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also err came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID lah I mean some people
err actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why lah I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything lah that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
um hold the border
to some uh high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news lah maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
uh explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the uh about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
uh was tortured was raped in front of other people
uh
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
they you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they
torture all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's err moral morally right lah I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
err don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say uh history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being uh killed
err you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
err
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
err I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really err
being outcasted in what you think about that
ya I mean in every community ah be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it err it err really err bring a hole
intentionally in front of people wah that was another level of murder I would say lah
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
err we did have I mean we do have uh casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it lah
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such uh racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others ah you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist lah
ya I heard that um
the malays do have more privilege than uh comparing compared to other races ah know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a uh national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country lah you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example ah
you and your neighbour
and do you think you are treated fairly as as a citizen
that's what I heard lah I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean uh but then ya that's what I heard lah when you are chinese indian
uh sarawakian or sabah you know someone from sabah
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in I mean in malaysia
actually
a clinic I don't know you could err easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say ah but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be err it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being ah you know
they are they are going to get charged in court eh I know you confirm know ah who's that guy ah najib uh najib razak and some other
his uh friends getting charged at court cause
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years ah but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way uh you know they
they uh give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny lah but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
ah our ministers in singapore is acting and how uh well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very uh
I would say ah I don't know what to say ah it's very good lah I would say what you think about that
uh ministry like for example financial or et cetera lah and but then
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke lah I mean have you watch the singapore one
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister shanmugam and mister what it's called ah mister vivian balakrishnan the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
you being a minister you will only err how to say uh not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do lah you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with uh in a higher position right they seem uh they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it lah so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most ah I repeat again most ministers
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
huh so you willing to wake up in the
um
uh maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
err like I said lah having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
uh ya I mean I do agree lah on what you are what you just speak you know but uh
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past uh thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
err no I I don't
I mean I might sound
err like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships lah
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong ah
have have you even notice that you know this person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said lah I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
it's embarrassing ah I mean this is not some gender inequality lah but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that um ya actually women ah do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
uh have to lead them lah I mean I mean this topic is very err subjective lah you know but I think in singapore women are really um having a good career earning more than man I would say
um
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding ah
I mean actually
and stuff and um
anyway ah it's a it's a good catch up with you I would see you again around
alright see you bye

okay hello hi ah amir how are you doing
huh okay ah
doing good err just I don't know
COVID situation
but the same for you lah you're also in army right so err it's just ah social distancing
okay
mmhmm
a'ah what are we doing now
okay understand
mm
ya
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
they take turns ah like in six
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see lah
ya
mm
yes
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh uh mm ah
mm
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
oh actually ah
ah okay okay good
okay lah
a'ah
err
I don't ah nothing much about it it's to me it's err quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause err
I post that like the last thing I said was err it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades ah
ah paradoxical kan
err
like it it
because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself ah
really your score
really ah I see
ah I haven't seen that
ah same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school err to secondary school lah
as of time
ya ultimately uh what happens err
what secondary school the person goes to will affect their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about err that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
uh huh
err these days like
like I don't read the news
ya
ah
ya
basically that's the thing
mm
err okay
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army kan
ultimately what is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
or
fireworks
I guess
so
err we come from then
we just talk to our own people lah
ah own circle lah ya oh ya
mm
ya these two years not wasted
ya so far
ya ah
ya err
so unless they went out of their way today
uh huh
mm
ah
mm
do anything else
ya true
ah ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in lah
but even in you can do stuff outside you can learn other skills in your free time ah if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
err so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
err which wouldn't be applicable lah cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn err can be applicable lah
err recently I went through this uh ammunition course
then err
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff ah err stuff related to storage
and uh inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
err
going out with my family that rarely happens
ah
oh ya it's it's different
I see
ah easily ah ah
okay mah
uh huh ah okay ah
that's that's true ah
most of the practical
ah
same
ah
family sunday
mm
err ya lah
for me I
I spend
on weekends mostly at home ah
I spend my weekends are mostly at home usually
this usually happens like on a whim lah
so
ya sometimes I just stay at home relax but at home
you talk to your family ah at home
ya
ya that's good
ah
a'ah ya really
ah
ya
ya
mm
good point ya the thing with me is that I have
err
more women at home than men
so ya I only I only get to talk to my father about it but then
every time I go home he always
ask me questions about err when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one ah like that err
ya but during err during
err the start of the
ya
ah then okay lah oh I forgot ya you registered at the same time as me
yes
yes
bro I only have two tickets dude
I only had two tickets
oh wow okay that's nice
ah must be western wednesday ah
of course lah
ten days worth of days
ya
ah
that's true that's true ya
ya
yes ya
uh huh
yes
uh huh
mm
that's cool that's cool wait
ah ya you didn't do twenty four uh twenty four kan
in tekong ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
hawker center ah
ya
they were like oh thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits lah we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but um is to is to
yes
ya
ah that's a good point ya they just did
ya
ah nine weeks and then next one nine months lah
ah eh I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you oh you're going to talk about the pay kan
so err to me okay
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
err back in kan my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but it's okay
ah okay
ah
ah
ah same
ah
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending lah
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
ah
mm
ah
mm mm
oh no me too
mm
mm
ya
same
yes yes oh my god
oh
election ah
ya
ya that's how it is but uh personally I also don't
err I don't follow that much
err I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates ah oh my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about but then finished already
so now they're talking about elections kan every day they will talk about stocks
wah buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive eh ah this one going up the percentages all
ya and err
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good lah I think it's good that
err more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
mm
mm
ya that's a good thing ah that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we err get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good lah
but the thing is that after this
we're going to go through how many years
err
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much ah
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
ya so
ya
okay
ah
ah
ya
mm
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K err by the end of
err because I I've I've made a lot of plans ah like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with investment savings plan
insurance oh my gosh yes
a few bucks okay lah about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
err how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
mm okay
mm
yes
mmhmm thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic
uh huh
ah
ah
mm
ah
ya actually though
forgot
you're talking about
pay right leading into something else
was it
ya financially independent correct
mm
mm
carry your own weight lah
yes
mm
ya the thing is that of course okay family is written in my blood you know
the they'll be there for life but they won't be there for life like for your life
you know what I'm saying ya the
like eventually you have to live your own life ah so
err you have to start eventually
and now is a good time to start being independent
ya we can yes yes we can that was the idea
that was like we were going to talk about food
ya I don't know it's you it's you you brought it up yes
what ya I don't get it
and like okay in school or like even now
people can talk so much about food I I don't I personally don't get it like wait have you tried this thing
or have you ya
not dude err not about that but what what did you ask amir
what's my favourite food oh snap
err my favourite food is
the scone from texas chicken
the scone the biscuit thing
mm ya
ya
ya
oh
that's true that's true
for the taste or
nugget okay continue
yes
a drumstick
ah
huh
a'ah
ah
yes
ah
ya it's booming
yes
I do too I do too
ya same ah
so you look at malay people you got the highest obesity rate
highest diabetes rate probably I'm guessing
yes it's delicious
okay ya it's not so good for health
ya
you said comfort food right
ban mian ah ban mian
ah okay tom yum
ya
what is like the maggi tom yum
ah
ah
yes that's true
ya
okay understand understand
mm
just so and so ya
when secondary school miss the pe pe
err swimming lesson kan ya then after that
everyone including everyone has maggi
yes
oh my god ya
ya
ya that was the times
ya
it doesn't fill but yes okay maybe back then maybe in primary school in in early secondary it fill
oh it's it's always bulking season it's like in it's it's it's mean
what thousand calories let's say ya ya thousand calories and I think that's not even enough for me
cause of the amount of work I do everyday but it's okay ya it's a eh that's another thing ah
err
sometimes okay there was a point like when I was studying for A levels right when
I was eating almost purely for sustenance
like I was just buying the cheaper stuff like err
what saying yes
wah
are you serious I went up by sixty ah
oh my god
ya
comfort ya it was comfort also okay okay okay
ah
uh huh
yes
ya that was the essence
mm yes it's true
huh
ah yes ya and I didn't mind I didn't mind it
because it was a perk for studying
no the thing is that I mean for sustenance because
I mean it because I would spend five hours inside an aircon room
just going away at my books
or okay I don't okay lah I cannot read for that long but
ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
ya so
then after that go back to study ah that's that's what life was like
err doesn't matter as long as it's food
and it's cheap cause money was
I mean okay my family is is in a fortunate enough position to not worry about that but
considering how much I got per month yes
oh oh my gosh oh my gosh
yes
ya and then non muslims also queue up
ya
no but I think it was it's fucker level it was fucker level
and
it technically was illegal in school canteens but it doesn't matter it was good and everyone liked it
ya used to be a secret menu item right
yes
ya
ya
yes
yes
mm
oh was in the canteen yes that's true
I never skipped lectures by the way
that's a that's a very good point yes
no I sleep during lessons that's the thing
ya oh my gosh
the thing is that I still sleep during lessons even now in
nothing has changed
err except I have to study less now so that's good I guess
err no nothing nothing too complex I can make sandwiches but okay
but I still make sandwiches if you think that it's just
taking raw items and putting it between two breads no there's a lot more to making sandwiches the
just take and pop
okay lah even on the pan okay fine I'm making it sound like there's more than it is
yes it is
it's not ya
ya
ya
mm
do you cook
okay
I remember yes
I get that a lot
a'ah lah
yours was half a bite sized
experiment ah experiment ya
ah that's true that's true
a'ah
ya you don't you don't think about that lah as a as a new cook even
yes
they'll just tell you how to do things easiest okay sometimes they does
but even then even then you have to create ourselves
yes
yes ya pretty wholesome
and he dodged my mum
a'ah
ya
eh was that was that trip just for me
oh my god
ah
okay
okay
yes ah
my gosh that was mad you oh wait
ah
ya the things you do I I haven't done anything like that in a long time like
I find myself not doing very kind these days I mean I do
like if I see opportunity like err
for example aunty needs to bring her bags outside the
ya like that I help but
err ya I don't see
like when it comes to friends I don't I don't I never see anymore
mm
ya
why is it
uh huh
okay
mm
ya
ya so
you doing the thing ah doing the thing
yes
yes that's true
yes ya
ya that's the that's the that's the silver lining in helping others lah
that you have to consider their personal dignity
like when I do volunteering also I go to people's houses and I clean their house
there's certain things that they will say don't do this
don't don't wash my dishes that's not for you to do that's for me to do don't mop the floor I can do that
can you just paint the wall
or like reach for the top because I cannot do that
yes
ya so when you help others
like especially old people they only want you
to help when they really need it cause
they they still want to feel able
like putting it bluntly they still want to feel like they can do things on their on their own
ya
mm
ya
ah yes
mm
ya so ya
I don't know I don't know how it got here
ya
ya food
it's not a question okay
uh huh
and that affects the taste
okay I don't know man I don't know
okay
oh yes
yes yes very true very true
yes
ya
fast food lah fast food is easy
mm
ramen
right
yes they can they can appreciate their prices because they're halal ramen stalls
ya
ya
yes
mmhmm
okay ya I think correct ah
ya you can have your pork
ya it's okay ah it doesn't affect me
ya I'm not it's just when I go out with them
ya like I'm your I'm your limiting factor when you decide where to go
but no they say they don't mind though
they say they don't mind
but do they though
ya a couple of times I've I just followed them to where ever they go then I just sit in
ah buy drink buy drink
ah
that's true
yes
not ice cream inside
ya ya your mum always that to put something inside but but I stopped buying I stopped buying though
ya it is it is
ah ya like where we are right now ah
yes
so much
yes yes
oh bro ya ya ya it's okay that was an easy option
and they don't mind ya I mean ya they don't mind
that's true that's true
some will say ya like
ah err halal lah so everyone like once it's halal but then
a lot of the halal food is unhealthy especially malay food
ya it's quite ironic
ya I think ah yes yes malay the malay malay food
ah that ah
ya ya it's very obvious ya
found another fucker
ah
yes
ya
yes
yes malay community
err my gosh like you ask your malay friends
ya it's older generation lah

ya
ah that's true
ya
ya
but they don't ah
ya
yes ya and it tastes nice that we have
ya
uh huh

oh so wait the reason why you bring your own food is because it's healthier is it
okay
that's nice that's nice that's nice
sushi okay
err
I'm not sure about that but I think it is also I think it is
ya
definitely
ya by a long shot
wait or oh sashimi itself ya that's true that's true
oh my gosh ya sashimi is so nice like I
ya
have it more often
yes
bubble tea hmm
nah dude okay ya I get it like a lot of people
err I'm not a big fan I cannot appreciate bubble tea
like I I can taste it if
I mean like it's okay if friends are getting it together right ya then I'll chip
I'll buy along ya it's a social thing social thing
I wouldn't get it actually no I do get it on my own sometimes like if I feel like it
but my bubble tea preference is very small
I wouldn't buy the

halal
halal
okay then what was stopping you thought
a'ah
and she was eating mala so
and she's quite one of those like religious kind of girl so it should be like halal kan
I don't know I was thinking of texting rusydi like
to either dabao or like see if she can like register us in that time we said I'm willing
to go the extra mile
to be registered in but ya
I did I didn't and I was like everyday I eat mala I was like
you took it for granted ah that's why it's gone now it's your fault it's literally your fault
ah
you usually eat the chinese sausage it's
it is
oh ya ya I did take that
we got the like the duck
ya it like flavours the whole dish
ya
ya
Ichikokudo ramen a'ah
as a family you mean like family dinner ah
ya so I think to me ramen is not my
oh you like you like yours ah
no I didn't
uh garlic ramen I felt like
the richness of the flavor tau
I didn't like want it to be spicy
ya
ya
I bought Samyang light
ya
ya
uh
it's lesser
it's
ya you can barely taste it
do you do you get where I'm like coming from
the ya the the the gravy
but this one the calories is lesser so I feel like I'm
it's literally about three hundred seventy calories
and the but the noodles are slightly thinner but it's the same texture the sauce is like less spicy
no but it doesn't affect much ah to me
but the taste to me the sweetness is a bit a bit stronger
oh uh
your ability to taste is there but it's still very spicy to me I was literally still dying
ya
Samyang
ah
the packet one not the cup
oh okay
serious
ah
ya
um
mm bachelor of
to be honest ya to be honest
err
okay so then I would I can get ten thousand off a year ya so it'll be twenty eight thousand and I'll only be there for two years so it's about fifty six thousand
no like I I called the overseas education it's like a
they liaise with the university for us
ya I called ya
kan ya ya ya
that's why I was just thinking then she said accommodation about uh eighteen thousand to twenty thousand a year
ninety plus already besides cost of school
ya like for real ya
right
ya
oo period
period
bro
ya attachment issues
elisa
a'ah
mmhmm
okay
super smart okay
how her is like almost like it is like three point eight kinda vibes
no but if she has a four point O it will be known tau because usually that is like honour roll
people get four point O in their courses usually like
like is broadcasted to the whole cohort
like during the process do people like the does the teacher like favour her
oh
daphne also four point O
what
oh ya ya of course lah
vibe
mmhmm
oh okay
ya
make enemies with a snap of a finger
oh
oh
down to the T I guess
ya
mm
oh
a'ah yes
ya
okay okay okay I mean everyone has that like dream that they want to go overseas right
like why would they want to come back because their university degree cert is mostly applicable there what
ya
loan right is a very risky
I don't I don't think singaporean I think it was from china I I can't remember ah I honestly can't remember
ya so within like five year he can pay it off
oh ya they have minimum wage ya that's right that's right
singapore like university degrees I think like three thousand like I find that quite like
low ah to be honest
which one
that's all ah he can pay it off in five years it's like a it's like a return on investment kind of vibe ah
but ya
but it's still a bit risky ah like what if I can't find a job
kan
ya but I mean I'm just putting it out there into the universe about the overseas thing
cause I'll obviously try my best to go into a local lah
like no matter what
it's quite scary ah to be honest
go overseas and everything
ya
um
like my class is number two like there's five classes so O one O two O three O four
ya
but I would not choose a class
kan what course right
ya because you did you know that I have a passion for planes right
foundation no because they will reteach A math A math is in year one again
of polytechnic ya
ya
what direction
in depth yet in the general direction

the TikTokers in general
do you notice how
as a person
super
no she is
she is like serious she has like millions
I know avani is not as famous as the rest
even james I feel like james couldn't even like hold conversations with her
like as a person she doesn't have that personality that
is linked to a influencer
ya she's just like any other introvert
who just got this fame and then she doesn't know how to talk like at least with all these you should learn how to talk right
but you don't
she's a good dancer but does she deserve hundred million do you agree
ya because it it literally convert
okay
to be on a record like none of the TikTokers because it literally it's just fifteen second videos
it's just fifteen second videos I think
ya but if you have this fame you should at least learn lah to
ya
ya
ya period bro nothing on them
ya
ya
do you think she's interesting
no when when we talk about influencers we don't talk about talking to them do you think they have a lot of personality because that's like the
a main selling point like james charles he's so interesting
no he has an it factor
that's what I'm trying to say
ya
he's
mmhmm
um talented
like legit it's legit just uh
period
going out and drinking coffee
fidgety a'ah

Coffee Bean
I don't know it was so bad like
it's like having an anxiety attack but like intenser
after that
like for thirty minutes later ya I I literally like I don't know it was so bad
ya
it's the white coffee tau you know it's like basically caffeine like zero per cent eh zero point one per cent that kind of vibe
ya
and knowing that I have like
caffeine like resistance and like all these like bad stuff
anxiety a bit
ya
I feel like it's worse that I didn't pass out because I get to feel everything except black out you know
so I feel like it's unfair like let me pass out bro just take me in
what

you should do it ASAP tau
ya it's it's basically just to get your money lah
it's so useless even if you pass fail it doesn't matter you just have to go through the simulator
then it will be easy
then you should do final theory ASAP also
final theory is more to me final theory is harder than
theory
no it's different content also you memorise a whole different set
I think I took like two hours memorising everything
ya
I did it in like legit like eight minutes
like I entered
like by a minute or two everyone's already doing it
but I was like the first to leave also
maybe
a'ah
booboo and molly

ya
not like in a bad way but like it's just rafi like
ya I do because I didn't wanna hurt her but
I just don't like rafi
which is right
fish and chips by the way
ya I mean fish and chips is always oh ya can be baked but it was breaded
but then she was like oh but you know what you know what I actually mean right
ya
so I got I got what she's trying to say but this thing that happened yesterday what I messaged rafi in private
is a separate issue
ya it is impulse it's a separate thing it's not like
what I'm gonna do you know
ya
okay
ya
mmhmm
oh
it's like not filling you know what I mean
I don't know I don't know
I don't know
I don't know I just feel incredibly guilty eating doughnuts
no like the calories is quite high
per doughnut like it's been like ya
like the one dollar fifty cent doughnut
if prefer cheat to me really
really
oh
period bro
because
I think kan what
seventeen years old
ya
then like what are you expecting you know what I mean
and it's like she shouldn't be finding for a boyfriend right now uh like in all honesty
like she's gone through two you know how like heartbreaking it is like I cannot even fathom
ya it's so unfair for her ah
be loved
no
ya
ya
like how like
no like the the marriage vibes
oh then uh it's okay
love
elsewhere you know like you will get it sufficiently from your home that kind of
ya
it's just sad for her
oh ya ya he's like born into that vibe
ya not too psychotic
or manipulative or toxic
oh you wash yourself kan
but your own batch
wah
we would put it in like one bus
she was alive until
sec two sec three sec two or sec three
she was she was the sitters she used to take care of my children all the time when she was about
mini relationship is not that right
a movie so I think that's why my mum is like so desperate leh
I have like a good relationship with you

okay uh my name is
iman salihin also from singapore poly
year two also doing uh marine engineering
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
err okay first
uh higher NITEC but then I found out that uh
I got a chance to go ah because my
three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly err through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
like why why are you not uh interested
mm
uh
what else
okay uh so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay lah
ya
for me is uh
uh
actually from
from till now I just keep changing
apparently now is muay thai
which I find uh more interesting than the others ah in terms of
err social connection and all that
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because uh
I guess now muay thai is going well so far
uh training quite intense so ya
oh
competition uh
not not a performance kind of competition lah
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
mmhmm
okay secondary school life okay actually because err
so
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it ah and I go through it ya you go
mm
ah
so
is naughty eh
uh
my choice ah because err sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
secondary school that is known to be
uh for like naughty kids ah and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the uh the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
why you never go for the interview and all that
he's like oh ya ya you're a student counsellor what ya ya so I
wasn't expected ah but then I was just like
okay lah never mind I just I just take the role lah do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like err
naughty stuff that I did at least
ah
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
other then that uh not much ah
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
ya like I think right after N level ah
still retail the the best uh job that I did lah as experience because okay I started
err in twenty seventeen which is err N level twenty seventeen after N levels uh
I join uh because a lot of my classmates work there also
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun lah for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent ah because usually
err we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
mm
oh
a lot
mm
mm
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also ah and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
mm
so
err actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then err so compared to retail
err in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then uh imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like err how how can I help you then they like oh no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes ah then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king lah
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did err
photo booth err
kind of job
and then
the pay was quite good ah like three hours
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
which was fun ah I got experience a lot
uh ya
that's all for the job experience ah
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute eh
it was terrible but uh
err I think part of
the job experience also is why we
uh business and all that
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
yup
ya
yup
shore
mm
so six months sailing
just one month of it how how can I cope lah
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of uh career
for me
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore err
exciting ah
ah
so think is okay lah
to have a stable living ah for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family lah
nine to five job kan
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
to be really you with your family ah and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
mmhmm
yup
you can pull down ah ya you can come back to shore maybe err continue as lecturer I you relax ah ya
mm
okay
mmhmm
ya
uh
so uh
police
uh it was a
ya
and it was like
oh what what yes
uh
that sense of err
ah ah
why ah
ya
frogmen
mm
so
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
mm so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test ah
mathematics lor they call it arithmetics
uh
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
err at that point of time
pay is
but that's the air force ah I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
uh
so
but
mm
mm
then hopefully just continue marine engineering lah
the different opportunities
ya consider
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup uh I I don't mind any uh what you call that like areas ah
mm
ya
ya
so
ya
but ya
what else
mm
what about copy ah
primary school life
spent there six years eh primary school
which are compared to our different stages lah
ya
ya
ya
mm yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending ah
ah the jump style
it's about err other than that
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
I was quite small in terms of size
err whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said oh you you sub the big one with the small one ah
but I I didn't mind lah because I know my potential and then from there uh
so
by primary
ya so
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
so so ya
ya
tekong
uh depends
okay usually striker is on your on the tekong's right
and then feeder is on the tekong's left
ya
usually striker and jumper for right leg
ya
wah I think after almost ten years playing
uh
I mostly play either tekong
ya
ya
the thrill of competition
and then uh
gain my own confidence lah
primary eh
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
err that was like the our best performance
for the senior team lah
uh
uh and I also think that's important lah because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until uh finals
uh
oh
east zone is junyuan primary
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
uh is qihua qihua primary
and
either qihua or junyuan ah
but
ya junyuan is the east zone
champions ah power house
but
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like err even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like uh
personally I felt was possible lah but it it came down to my
my uh my team
that day first
first team
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
that was so it was
I I lost ah it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
uh if
if err one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
err we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
eh but ya
ya
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us lah
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
uh
it was a big accomplishment lah
but ya
okay
performance
mm
oh okay
okay
ya ya ya
is is a very big accomplishment lah
congratulate lor
which is demotivating ah
yup
yup
I think
ah that's why
no
so
no
okay lah uh so
ya together with someone
uh
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
uh
this overseas trip
uh it was a service learning trip lah
so
seven class
so
she's from err two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
uh
so we went to this overseas trip then
uh I tried to make friends ah then uh
one of them was her
mm
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that lah
and then uh
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then uh
during sec three
uh we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
it was just to me like a
ya ya
so
uh
late sec three
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer ah
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then ah
I think during N levels uh we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together lah
for what
to ask
uh
obviously I ask ah
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
uh
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me ah basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay uh I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that ah
but I still see a future lah is just
how things will work out
but ya
how about you
okay
but okay
mmhmm
ya

alright so today we're gonna do twenty random questions
twenty random questions with aria
okay so twenty random questions and you just have to answer um as soon as I question you
ya
ah depends
okay are you ready
okay first question
being if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
I'm not sure either
family time mmhmm

secondary one just moving up to high school
right
period
ya
changing
ya everything was pure I think everything was pure
the first year
just half a year of secondary one for me to actually like okay how do I I can alter my skirt or like do my hair in a certain way
and all
ya
sometimes I even eat in the toilet by myself
ya ya
mmhmm
ya
that's right
right ya ya ya
wait for time ya
have you ever slept in class
really okay
you're a student leader how cool is that how does it feel to be student leader cause I
I'm never a monitor or even a student leader
ya I in in primary monitor right and then
err I think class class chair or something
ya but then for my school like they for primary school they don't really call
uh I don't know they just call monitor and then secondary school they call student leader um or like for a class it's like chairperson something like that
I mean student leaders the prefect who do the like the gates and then the ceremony
you were
you were the cool girl with the jacket
so yes or no
of course we had ya
mmhmm
okay
mm
cool
mmhmm
wow
right right
cool I mean I didn't really get to be any of it cause um I think quite opposite I had time where it was rough my family and everything so
I will I got bullied I got people who dislike me the way I look or the way I talk and they always like
why do you talk like that you know and I'm like
had to walk you know and then
and then ya I had it wasn't really a pleasant one
some also
okay really
mmhmm
mm
right
ya
right
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh okay
had to
ya
okay
um
since
err I mean you said you were doing this and that in your secondary school
is there anything memorable any meal that was memorable ever like ya anything that you remember from like canteen
okay that was
the bomb
something ya
yes
affordable price and the
of course ya but the thing is
the the food there
just like any shops outside you know they have a coffee shop they have one restaurant too you know so um affordable there's food that vary the price that varies
you can if you like low budget can get like perhaps you know
all that we have
how come why
okay
okay that's a
that's sad
one of the malay shops down there

stable for me
ya
I mean I don't want mee
as long as it looks like a food
I think it's okay for you
ready for next question
okay
mmhmm okay um
labels in secondary in school you know you know society gives you a kind of look or what you go through and specifically what do they label you as
what do they label you as
that's the thing it's a sensitive question but it's fun question cause
we can see in from different uh perspectives you might have a different understanding or something
I also may not understand
right mmhmm
as a boy
cause
sure
so you had multiple
you want to run through it
that's primary school
very athletic
mm

you mean your characters the way you are with people
ya ya
wow

backstabbers

right even at work itself I think there are people like that
but cause we are grown a little bit we learnt from
whatever happened
ya
right
for sure
cause you start a job done
mmhmm
okay
so if you have
if you have one wish
for you to you you could have done you have that one way that you will definitely be granted and
this wish can only be used for your like secondary time
what would you wish for and that one wish would definitely for sure
confirm come true what would you use the wish for

there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS
what time is that yes
but you don't have to wear like a mask like a it's not mandatory ya
it wasn't it wasn't
mmhmm
true we're not taking care of our own earth
mmhmm
true
right the icebergs are melting the world are rising
right
so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
influential that's that's it
mmhmm
ya
mm
as long as it doesn't affect our daily food
what we have to care about it
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay speaking of which if you have
um
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life
you know let's say the world is not doing good anymore and all like okay we have enough for everybody first one could be but we only supplying this amount of food this type of food for you
for the rest of your life
ya for the rest of your life
I cannot
either meat or spaghetti
ya like
steak
ya steak
you know
we can cook like
we can fry it we can like
boil it
ya
can boil it
make it into a soup or something
you know it could be bland but it still feels like at least I'm eating something you know
you know
kan
that's a sad meal
that's what we have to eat for the rest of our lives
okay
okay now speaking of food right speaking of food
let's say I bring you over to a restaurant
named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
you get what you do
comes around
so if if if I were to bring you to that restaurant
and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
mmhmm
ya
but why
I was rushing for for work
you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
um
mmhmm
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
mmhmm
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be um maybe um answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if um I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be um
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I hope so even with my son I feel like if I were to go to this this this restaurant
probably my son I mean like the days where I purposely sleep in cause I don't want to cook you know I'm just like
ya
okay okay
okay I have a question
okay this is a question for you where I think everybody thinks about it everybody um ponder about it it's a dilemma
the question sounds like
would you prefer good looks or a fit body
when we look down uh
we don't want a show off our fats we're only wearing black all the time
you know but it could be you're fit you know you you you be wearing good clothes good body shape just nice you know
um perfect
you could be walking here and there the whole day and you're like okay it's not so tired but you'll be like having acne all over the place
you know you probably have scars
fit body or good looks
ya fit bodies ya
I mean you are with good looks good looks mean you have like a
mmhmm
mmhmm
why would you this is a
mmhmm
ya
ya me too I mean
right
mmhmm
right
anyway I have a child right so
it's like
if I have good looks and I'm unfit
you know I can't be I have to be on par with his energy or I have to be more cause
yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you mean
ya people would be like oh my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup
very true very matured
speaking of which since you choose fit right
ya what is it
okay
no
no it's like since you choose fit body so what do you do to keep what what you do to keep your body fit ya
ya
who cares
ya
ya
right
keep the body busy
but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
mm
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually uh a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
mmhmm
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
mmhmm
it's bad
what
mmhmm
mmhmm
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
um eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
just health ya mm ya true cause
partner
oo wow
I feel I feel I think it comes back to this saying cause um you cannot have
no serious okay no if let's say ya I used to go for looks cause I don't do much to them you know what I mean and what I meant is like
uh they could be they they they just have to look good cause I want to look good
with them ya
like do I have a good
good appearance
ya example like but now more of like you're gonna do errands with me you know you got
no I'm not looking for a maid maid is like care for my job for my chores at home but what I mean is like
as long as they are healthy as long as um healthy being um happily not depressed not forced
you know they are happy and
they feel like whatever they are they know that they are loved
by their partner
you know they don't have to be like oh I have breakouts and you know like you gonna leave me you know I don't I
why
just use moisturiser or something I try to tell you that a lot of times you know
okay so for last question would be
if um
if you had a wish now
in this age and day
what would you wish for
what would you wish for that would
um like something that would help you with your life right now
you don't want to be materialistic
mmhmm
a money and house
or house
ya ya ya just only one
or house
is that what you're working towards to now
mmhmm
of course it does everything needs money
mmhmm
like it makes you feel satisfied too you feel like you have done your part at least you make other people life easier to you know like you could help with chores
like buying for them
things for their needs
mmhmm
you wish for that
okay for me I feel like I would want a house
a good house or I could really build
a home where you know um
it's comfortable it's big enough
it doesn't have to follow like the house you know the singapore standard house it I want to have like a a good
maybe
ya like it could be
beyond my imagination you know I just want a house with this big and then the final product would be however it be like you know I don't want the room to be this small but I want to be this big but it could be
end up a more than how many square feet
square foot it is you know
right
ya
for sure
mmhmm
right
mmhmm
mm
they have better
right
mmhmm
right
okay
okay so if if if you could say one more thing
to yourself now
okay to yourself now and to your ten years
ago your thirteen years old self what would you have said to the two of you
patience at thirteen years old
or to your twenty three years old
to both

um
ah so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
uh huh
so other than
when you
ah yes so is so now when you see for yourself eh actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
ah I enjoy eating it which is something good lah kan hopefully
you can cook ah more things lah
ah exercise more ah exercise more in the imagination lah in reality I won't exercise
ah yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
eh this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya lah ten years ago still can play lah but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play ah maybe
ah if I play football with
ah I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become lah
doubt so lah I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it lah don't want to waste my energy ah
during the malaysia cup ah
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over lah first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
ah whom is like
and the passion is just not there lah I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities ah
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
ah football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame kan then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
ah in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
ah I can just ah imagine myself to be ronaldo or messi
on the screen
kan if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers kan
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things ah um
uh huh
yes
ya so that is the different lah people change
kan so maybe certain things will be left behind lah
ah
ah
ah
ah
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time lah kan cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
ah impossible ah kan ah
okay um
yes
ah behind kan then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
ah just nice for his ah
or his or her development
in the future lah even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
ah ah
yes correct
ah
um
ah
ya lah
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
ah
ah but in terms of travelling
ah malaysia kan
ah ah maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia ah
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
ah um
ah favourite place ah favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay lah our singapore dollar is strong lah then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe kan
but it's a really complete
uh shopping lah
for the clothes only lah
ah
ah
ah
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay kan but of course there is there different lah when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new kan but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is ah is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also lah kan
uh but
yes ah
ah ya lah you will set the goal when you go ah
ah ah
ah I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part lah kan
I mean
ya lah I think certain things you are more
ah
comfortable in handling and
ah certain things I am more comfortable in handling lah I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
ah planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly ah
ah ah ah
ah ah
ya lah ah when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
ah then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
ah
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay lah
ah
we are realistic lah kan what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over lah I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small lah but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it kan so that is the difference
ah ah
ah ya
I think for the jakarta one
when we reach
there we were like eh
first thing is the airport lah
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
err shopping centres err in the eighties kan
so okay lah that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
uh
ah
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
ah something being kept for so long
it's not rotten ah it's like the carpet never wash for so long
ah lah
quite enjoyable lah in jakarta the
different way of life
ah
yes
yes our wedding
ah our wedding planner ah
ah ah
uh huh ah yes

um ah
ah the third
ah
hotel
basically is ah it's all paid for

basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow eh
ah
testing ah ah
tanah abang
yes
ah
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours kan
just for the sake of
ah getting err
cheaper cheaper price ah kan
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by oh you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
err
is money yes
ah ah ah
ah
ask for directions
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
ah

looking out for us and
so we we feel safe ah then
ah the hotel it was ah harris hotel a'ah

in terms of the hotel is is nice lah not old not
over not so that impressive but

basic necessities are there in terms of the the cleanliness of what you call it you know the cleanliness
ah we have a driver yes
a'ah
a'ah
yes ah
kuta beach ah
it it is the way they set up the kuta beach
is like trying to follow gold coast ah so it's like this one is gold coast
ah in indonesia lah gold coast bali
ah the way they set up but of course a bit different lah first the
the cleanliness of the beach
a'ah
ah ya motorcycle ah ah mm
a'ah
into the sea ah ya ah
yes ah
the water is not so
so blue lah in compared to gold coast
ah gold coast the water is blue but now got sharks
mm mm
a'ah
a'ah mm

ah mm
we took almost ah half a day
ah guide
so we are staying in the vehicle to go up all the way to the

raja and ah ah I think for you first time meet lina ah for me first time I meet both
ah can click kan a'ah
ah
ah mmhmm
ah
malaysia ah
a'ah
yes ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
older lah ah older
but the penang one could have been better cause if not raining
four families cut down to three ended up to two kan ah
ah
if there is a travel restriction
ministry of foreign affairs will be alert
and they will say
ah advise people not to go there ah a'ah
yes
I enjoy the food down there
ah
home of P ramlee
penang yes
ah ah
ah
ah like very interested to talk to to us eh ah
ah
ah yes that one is the the tower
ah ah ah eh they say what
they emphasise as the biggest
the biggest curve
in southeast asia
ah it's the biggest
ah
ah scared of heights ah
ah
but if I yes
ah
ah that time the new attraction they haven't finish doing yet ah the new attraction they
you can be you can I think you can do flying fox a short
flying fox lah then outside the building
that one they haven't finish yet ah I think if that one already have I think you can forget it about raja going on it lah ah
that one is the bukit bendera
ah ah yes
ah][ah um)(um
ah ah ah um
ah ah ya
but it was very bad remember that time even then malaysian chief
the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van kan we can see the certain places which was
ah damaged lah due to the due to the flood
ah then one thing about penang ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building kan which is ah a bit
but
conserve for the sake of ah conserving ah sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them lah cause they did conserve their ah
upside down museum ah um
singapore rediscovery vouchers ah
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal ah then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so lah other countries we cannot control kan
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it lah eh
at least meet up so we won't be so
ah no new cases ah
a'ah
ah ah shopping centre
ya lah ah
kan ah disposable shoes disposable clothes then
okay so other than travel
ah in year twenty twenty one lah kan lah what would be
your wish your hope in twenty twenty one
mm
ah primary two hopefully he will do better than in primary one
ah
mmhmm mmhmm yes
family members ah ah
so other than that for me is err ah
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
ah maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated lah trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority lah and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue oh then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
ah
a'ah
ah
eh lah
a'ah
mm
ah
ah yes
ah
ah
ah yes
ah cousin ah
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best lah
I I submit document I submit application
ah
ah
the thing is is like that
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother lah kan
have to go through a lot of places lah
the future
you have to go through a certain
authorised by us to do the ah assessment so go through check up again
so um um
ah ah
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done kan
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then ah
I think now is
ah
involved ah uh huh
ah do the best that he can be ah
enjoy enjoy what
ah make try to make his life ah
meaningful lah that is what
ah
ah
ah ah
a'ah
a'ah
um um um

like
secure myself financially
um

mmhmm
the internet also they want experience as I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find a starting job to get all these experiences in a good company
I mean it's it's common lah
but
everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
but I hope I hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent jer companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad
it tarnishes your whole reputation
everything your hard work all gone
focuses on your
ah employees welfare
you know and job progression is super important
job progression
yes sure
wow
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
wah that's a bit unfair
orh it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know lah this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
um
exist
ya so and anything complain jer
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
err basically I just supervise the kids lah
um you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
um
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
a moment later you're there changing the
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
homework
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
torturing so
a lot of people
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
like
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay lah I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
oh ya I did oh my god I miss her so much um
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and ah I met man the house so so empty
and
and ya lah
and all that ya
but
I don't know I'm happy for her
ya that's like
I mean like
nowadays um
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just
you just
it's important to go with the flow you know
like
not forced upon it
not
find it you know once you stop finding for it then things
come
ya that kind of thing
but I heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right

mashallah I mean like
you know last long you know till
till married so wait okay
K
now I need to ask you important question

I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay lah take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
oh I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
um me and my family okay
I don't know eh I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have eh have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay lah slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
oh man
I saw this post and they said that um
the first child
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
um ya pass off so
but at the same time you you are nurtured
um
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third lah
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya lah are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
mm
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
um okay talking about sweet right
I scared leh I scared of diabetes
um
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
diabetic
his deserts you
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
oh my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high lah
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower so that you
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
mm
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
you save so much
one to two days
wah this is
is quite hard
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know like
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
her
grandfather
and then drove back home
and left him there
malaysia lah
singapore
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then um they receive a phone call from the dad um the dad call another lah his son lah another son
then went there
and he said the father said okay me home lah then then they say like oh it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good leh
because
of um
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so ah
how old is she now
but the around
oo
I think more the the the the over sixty five lah
definition of
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
no fresh air I'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
I I enjoy people watching honestly so I can relate to your grandma
oo that I like the question mm
um I
think kan I would
probably would love
love
to
just
um
around
okay ah
paris area
london because
is it so rushing
I have heard a lot of people saying that
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know um
ya lah but that's my goal lah
just
ya you how about you
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit lah
it's just too fast pace but
but
ya lah
and like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control kan
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
mm
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated what
in certain way
but
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
I mean that's good lah
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
like
eh okay
but like
ya lah
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
oh I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so um and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
meant to be
that's why I believe lah so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
oh man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
then I
kept up
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
wah a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
oh my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that is a good school
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
intake
but inshallah
I mean like you can I can lah I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya lah you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can lah
and is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
I mean you just mainly just look at your major what minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
ya
I think minor minor in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare what
why not
oh ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
eh I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
but
okay lah I mean there are so many expectations of us
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
but
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about lah
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
in singapore
because all those movies are
always based on other other countries you know
I don't know like
okay like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like oh
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
ah okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like ah rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like
like usually you Netflix
wow
wow I barely have time for that
do you watch modern family
oh my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
oh is it good
it's funny
it's it's cute
okay okay
is it okay I didn't know that I mean like I always
oh I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
but like okay lah I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like uh
okay lah funny but eh quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
oh that's so sweet
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
I can't like I don't have self control
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
over
time on it
alright oh my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya lah I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely oh my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the the older one or
eh the younger one
eh wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
oh are you serious
you don't play with the second one
I see boring
but
ya lah I
I mean I love four
but overcook is fun
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya lah I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
you will get
more
than what you save
hundred K
I mean it's quite
reassuring lah to know that
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on
I mean I can I can like brief you through it lah
like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay
we should

what do you think of young marriages or arranged marriages
hit me
uh okay let's say ha
okay err as young as eighteen
child before marriage so you are saying eighteen years old is like a child still a child
oh
ah bad image like that ah
mm
mm
true true
okay then err let's see if err they are they are married already then after that um they they are not stable
both of them after O-levels maybe they don't want to work anymore I mean they don't want to school anymore so they took part time job then they feel like oo got so so much opportunity in this part time jobs so they want to grow from those part time jobs
ah but they're not stable yet ah like they still ya like don't have any plans yet for the future but they know they want to get married
like papers in papers like at eighteen I want to get married now
what are your thoughts
oof
okay
okay focus on marriage first ah would you allow your children to do that
mm okay
true okay
in singapore
oh okay
like agree
ah ah
mm
mm
mm
ya he's the one that kind of thing ah
ya ya ya ya
true ya
ya
and you're already married anyway kan
ah
true
okay then it brings me to the next question
uh if let's say like err you you get into a relationship already ah then the guy is like I want to take it to the next level but you you're in a fresh relationship you know
what okay so
the the major question is like how long do you think is a good time until you should move on to the next step in life
ya time
ah
okay okay
mm
okay
play around you
mm
huh
they call it off for eight years' oh
eight years oh my the fact that you actually drop so easily ah the eight years
ah
ah
interesting ya
aiya
ease sia
ah I like I want to to settle down tie a knot you know start the family planning you know like
start my future lah you know
yes sia
oo wah
mm
true true okay ah
okay we are
next year is our third year ah
mm
true true
that's basic adult things ah adult marriage things you know ya like oh we have to save money to buy house you know that kind of thing
so I think that's what both our parents are looking at ah
but ya lah like what you say ah it can be on papers you know so that is not a sin for us to be together
mm
mm
true
I to me I ya I see it from that point of you ah to me ah because honestly being this old
but it's just that like you know older generation thinking I guess I don't know
but ya what do you think
true
ya sia actually true and it's workaholics
I mean people different err different mindset lah ah
mm
it's true oh my god that one that one is a major issue in singapore sia like money is such
money just plays a big part eh in singapore
okay lah I mean
okay ang moh err
mmhmm
mm
true ya ya ya okay lah it is
actually err okay when I was in kan everything there was so slow
like I have to get in if not cannot sia late for err late for work you know that kind of thing
ah
ah
a lot of people coming in ah and I I feel like it's not stopping you see true I think a lot of people ya
ya dead rich but the point is like
err very late very like um she said that
singapore's err healthcare is the best
because singapore puts there are healthcare like one of the priorities of the country so I feel like err singapore is number one lah for healthcare
ya like a lot of people come to singapore like I saw a lot of people okay there's this ah
web for err what's that called
they come to singapore to get treatments ya so like err this one is cancer so they quickly come to singapore to get a treatment for cancer this one got tumour so you come to singapore do all this
and then another one is ya no lah I mean it's not that they do it but a lot people want to come to singapore to get that treatments because it's reliable
then um I don't know lah a lot of people just come to singapore just for healthcare
ya
no oh my god you know healthcare is so bad lah
is so bad
ah ah ah
I okay come on lah singapore is
err accessible okay like
got clinic here hospital is nearby in every err town area and then that kind of thing ah correct but in if you live in the suburbs it's so hard to get to the hospital it's probably like one hour drive away
twenty minutes away thirty minute away that kind of thing
suburbs
who have a lot of land then they do like farming you know that kind of thing ya so it's those like with big plotted lands lah it's not necessarily like they are not rich
but it's just that they have a lot of land and they want to do a lot of things like farming you know that all that kind of thing that we cannot do in singapore lah basically
so ya there are okay lah as
they do have the land that's all that is the good thing about they have land to do a lot of things but then sometimes they don't take
ya they don't take advantage of what they've been given lah
so
oof
ya hor
I believe singapore because like singapore I usually like if any land any
bedok jetty changi you know ya
so I guess this I understand lah why the government is building all this
ah we are we are not an enemy to anybody
to me it was like
true ya
that's true that's right
ah that one that movie
ah and ya and ya ya lau pa sat
oh is it it's true ah
oh I didn't know leh
oh
oh uh huh
edit
is it green screen
huh

oof true true
eh but a lot of films are getting back you know they're going back to filming
ha
girl
okay I heard
what is it I mean okay maybe their beliefs are not right like what they have done during the filming is not good
and then like err maybe another twenty minutes then I sit down I watch lah
then after that I go off
ah ah ah
oh serious ah
oh
oh
mm
oof
ah ah
ah ah ah ah
so they didn't fall in love in the movie
mm
mm
boring
oh
ah ah
ah ah ah
ah ending ah ending okay I realise
mm
align
repeat same
so disappointing sia
okay I go first ah mine was that time
ya
eh not bad say the
okay ah sorry ah
no
okay I mean I watch X-men but then fun
ya
but lah kan she say seriously what you said
wah
judging me sia
err apocalypse eh is it apocalypse
I watched the
eh ah after when the cinemas open
then they were released some film
aiya wasted
mulan
uh
scooby doo
cartoon jer ha
cartoon
yes
it was going to be released
ah ah
ah ah
mm
uh they had two and one lah because you can only sit in pairs
at the cinemas
my boyfriend to sit with his friend then sit alone ah
bo jio
it was I think last month lah
eh no no no not last month
when were oh this month this month
september this month kan
this month lah ya ya ya this month I remember it was earlier this month sorry lah
we visit should have
ya but I I saw like
they have very little stuff like um maybe like three at the counter they okay actually they have a lot of staff tau
and then they needed like people who do food food and drinks
so I saw like
then oh got wider go beyond they got to ah so err twenty then
a'ah
ah
so they have more people lah actually but it's just that it's very little like uh one each
but it's extra work
you know it's extra work
but I always go when there's the double deal the we buy fifty get hundred dollars
that hundred dollars that you know when the ya I'm always up to date okay I
ya I'm always up to date okay I love Timezone and I got so many points
ya
but then
ya speaking of that
did you see the one of the ministers suggests that singaporeans like they if they want they they can take second jobs seh
aiyo is not the east coast lah laila ah
mm
mm
ya
true
ah ya
ish woo woo woo chill
ya sia
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
but if okay lah let's say if err
even if we were to take this second job right how to okay for example we take you as an example no we take you as an example okay you work six days a week you know
where can you find time to slot in the second jobs sia
oof
Grab money come out more money come out what
time
electricity ya correct what
so how
ya your places
your place
ah declaration form
ah
ya ya actually some some workplace like that you know ya so
ya lah
mm
true and also if you could get you in trouble seh
right
mm
like
then you just getting yourself into trouble seh
ah ah ah home based ah
mm
mm
true
but then this second job doesn't have
right
ya
like there are I I guess got good and bad lah like to do this okay the good is ya more income lah
true
as in what
mm
mm
ya that is if you have a family
no who say no family no problem what about your parents
what about your social life sia
oof
that's right okay
walao such
oo right now ah right now okay lah like money lah money
being twenty three I have no time already eh okay I think if I'm twenty three and single I still have time ah
ya because there are so many singles at their credit issues what thirty forty plus and they are still going good some of my lecturers are single and they are like still doing fine they are happy with their life ah
and so like kan
oof
tough one ah eh
mm
I I think we are always chasing for both
but it' so hard to juggle both at the same time ah
ah
that's why ah ah seh
mm
they are promoting more ah like about mental health uh mental health you know mental health issues a bit more than before ah
like uh
they they still listen ah so I I think still not bad ah
ah ah ah oh my god I remember
ah stress lah eh no no worries lah this one just stress lah eh you take a break lah I'm like it's not that easy sia
like what ugh
it's raising more when even if it's not in singapore kan
uh the the donation like the whole
the whole like worldwide is raising awareness about mental health I think because
mm
ah
mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
a'ah
mm
ya
have you heard um
uh
yes yes
like did you know about it before the movie
ah ah ah ah
eh
not really oh I know the short term
something of identity disorder something like that
I can't remember ah but like she change you know from one person then she change to another person
no no no I totally forget what is the term for it
but she she really change her right now is like
ah
I was like
I was so shocked and I was thinking to myself what if I had that disorder or what if someone else had this order how am I going to handle the situation
oh my
god
walao
it's like verge like like like uh train to busan no leh
you know because everyone personalities is just hidden
oh I found I I found it it's called dissociative identity disorder ya
she had twenty two alters
serious ah but she did not like split the movie
ya
ya ya ya she said that she uh she did not like how um like like how the movie portrayed her lah
no no no it's not about her but it was uh
they did not like the how the movie was being uh portraying this uh dissociative disorder dissociative identity disorder
ah
correct the beast the beast was the one that she was like there's this is not real
he he does like uh interviews with people
this is already right you dealers lah
padilla
mm
maybe
maybe ya
ya
the beast
mm
mm
oh
ah
oh
oh
so pure is not in terms of virginity
oh
oh
woo interesting ya
I want to watch ah okay ah not bad
ah yes I know
I know the second one also
ah yes glass
but interesting ah
especially for singaporeans who are like they're not exposed to these kind of things much it's not rare what to see all these people

mm
mm because
and having a lot of money
or like when I want to buy something that I like
then the second one I think I want my own transport
oh best part is
but I since I already
the travel you know
ya then the third one
I want to have like
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
so what about you
mm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
talking about family gathering
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
mm
mm
mm
ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait lah for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
then
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no lah we put that aside first then we
chalet
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food lah
forever food and our transportation
like
share among us
book out already kan so okay lah
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
kan celebration also need more money
decoration need money also
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
party together like that
um you know that a
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ah
mm
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
ya lah marina is nice lah
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one uh one place where I know
outdoor pe
cause that time when I went uh to marina
uh I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there ah
so
we
parasol whatever lah
ah splash lah
like
but still like nice because
I think I think our cousin have I think ah I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still uh that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
oh
ya ya this one ah
mm nice we can go this kind
mm
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
they let us
mm
I not sure later after this we can google ah whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
mm
mm
mm
we confirm know we won't sleep what
oh nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle lah
mm
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate eh
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad ah
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade lah no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
whoa okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before ah but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
mm
what about glove
for rental lah
mm
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want ah
what if people really got like
pee on it or what eww but ya still ee okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
like
what's more that that you can do over there
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
mm
that's why I say but okay ah okay ah it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
mm mm mm
nice ya but
then the rock climbing indoor
ah zip line I I I don't think so hello inside the mall have zip line
when I was interning at kallang
but I feel shy
ya ya you need to pay I mean like obvious lah you need to pay but it's like
munch munch on snack or what
mm
ah ya lah can but
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
ah ya lah since we already book right we don't need to personally book in with our own body pe
no lah I mean we can just say what sorry excuse me this is my place I already booked this place uh then you can just ask them to go out lah
mm
so ya
but I'm gonna stay at the side
can what
but it's nice what it's like when you at the seaside
nice what it's such a good
uh memories
serious lah then after that
you
ya
you cook one I cook one
okay lah whatever lah nice whatever lah okay
and then we ask then
while waiting they
ask them to buy or whatever buy all the stuff all that
ya
mm
so that
oh I I don't think so ya
I mean it's gonna be only the two of us
mmhmm
ah so that's what you meant
no lah we just put at the same place lah
like I mean like the same kind
so
mm all the same so that
ya
ah ya ya ya nice what like that we can just throw after that
mm
mmhmm
eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
mm
sushi

because
but if not whatever
mushroom
mm mmhmm
since okay so what I'm planning to do is
we
we from this side from west side we bring food
they from east side bring all the drinks and chips
so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
then we need one mineral water confirm
mm ah ya lah obvious

uh them to
as long as everyone can eat

ya
ya like the normal picnic right ya
ya
mmhmm
but we tell them already what from from like
and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
uh if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
we're gonna spend a lot of money there

my max is five five of not attending class five times
mm tower block level five
uh huh level six
monday
I forget leh
ya I can I can't remember
honestly I'm done with school so
while I was
err
when I was what am I suppose to stop talking
okay okay
mm
for nine nine to five jer
and then uh eh
nine to I forget what time
then
aduh
I call that ramen stall eh
wait
aiyo
among us among us
ya you said like that it's among us
I don't know eh I feel like this type of thing ya obviously
mm
oh ya ya ya ya ya he's he's a very soft guy
which is good but sometimes not good because
ya exactly
then I feel like it's pointless lah honestly I mean I don't mind giving him advices so that he will be aware of like whatever that is gonna happen that he have never experience before but at the same time if
a bit tiring lah can say
cause I know that he will still love me even I look ugly or what
dress up a lot and I wear makeup a lot then
think four
four fifty
about there lah
ya
I feel like that's why ah
and like I don't know why I don't see the point of
oh like that okay lah
mm mm oh oh
a'ah
okay okay
oh ya
light light festival ya
scare khine
I don't know and I was quite shock that she actually told me eh oh really ah oh ya ya that one I told you right that was quite good eh good acting girl
oh my gosh damn I miss being in the same class as you sia stupid
I cannot be friend I cannot like someone when that someone is my friend
ya
but I really like our friendship sia it's really quite unexpected sia honestly
honestly I didn't really want to make friends so with anybody because every semester I have to change class do you think it will work

okay
ya okay okay got it
yup
but it's also the whole heavy thing lah once again to have to drag in her luggage or or I don't know couldn't tweet
hmm send it to her
you name it lah they will print it on something and it's digital printing which means you don't need a like must order minimum hundred or what can even give her of our faces to wear on which day today I feel like a sham day
today ya ya correct correct
ya ya ya ya ya and when she lonely she can talk to the picture
ah guys I need some advice
ya ya okay
so ya I think I think vista print all this website got ah and I think this that would be the same website that also makes a photo book
you know what I do after awhile I throw it out I don't like clutter
eh I've had to throw all sorts of things in my life in order to like fit it into this house and also when I went overseas to work
much I don't have pictures of people from secondary school all bird fly high hard to catch friends like you hard to forget I don't I I never bothered to keep those things I feel like um if you want me you know where to find me ah then we can hang out
ah I don't I don't know ya so anyway photo book wasn't the best thing lah but I thought some pictures or or the other thing is we give her a bunch of pictures that are nicely printed and then we order the thing online say buy from amazon but it to be delivered to where she is ah
ah
like super glam shit and then we like then can pin the poster have like cool headline or what then write some funny copyrighting for venue and
date you know that kind of thing like date that when
ya ya I know I know I know ya ya ya ya ya and I think actually that's what she prefers too but I suspect when she she said that time that cause she wasn't even sure whether this is happening like whether they're gonna be able to secure the mortgage get the place there and be able to you know actually move lah
but then I suspect once it's confirmed there got iskandar is settled there is a flight date ticket
confirm she want to meet everybody and his brother so I suspect there will be a bigger thing
I don't know how big is big err when where how we're going to do it in groups of five as per the government guidelines
but
but for us I think I don't know is it just come over here and do our usual or is it want to have like a a lovely dinner outside somewhere
okay ya I'd like that
fuck so all these by the end of the month okay
ya I'm ya ya ya and she has this fear of
to do with the two of them yes yes
what are people thinking of me
yes she has
ya ya she's definitely discovered
they flocked to her ah all the little malay girls on the floor the little mod girls
they love her
ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah ah ah
cause that was the day that you found out I see okay got it
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
fuck lah she's such an integral part of the group I'm gonna miss her like hell man
I've had it with you all yup ya ya ya ya ya ya
ah my understanding is that the the guy was playing the both of them and then sarah beef
with you was that you were talking about it to both sides
okay
ah ah ah ah ah
ya ya ya ya
so all this was happening like at the same time while he's flirting with sarah he also like cuddling up with tini what the hell man
ya ya ya ya ya
yup
alamak
uh huh
wait this was the day we went to eat pizza
fish I didn't know the pizza had such undertones so when you brought up pizza thing I thought you had something to do with she coming but not feeling like eating but then is it she no need to contribute to the bill you know I thought it was that sort of like bill and who pays what drama fuck okay okay okay
yes
yup
yup
ya
so did sarah know that jas was doing this with tini
she didn't know either okay got it
ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya
so what was tini first reaction then when you said she went bitch mode
okay
ah
ya ya ya ya ya okay
then she come down for what
ah ah ah ah
right
ah ah ah
okay
that's right
ya okay got it
yup
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya yup
that is not nice explain
like a party girl no
yup
ya that's the you cannot correct correct you can't mould other people's perceptions lah ya ya ya
ah that jas is playing that jas correct correct cause tini was like totally completely oblivious to it right she didn't know ya she didn't know sarah didn't know as well but tini felt like the person who was
losing her heart over him ah it sounds like it like like tini really was quite set on it being rather serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya so it's a it's a big deal for and she must have been really hurt
mm
when there are friendly things you don't reciprocate ya
mm
ya ya ya ya I remember that
ya
okay
just even indulge in gossip you get what I mean ya ya I know you don't do that either
okay
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
yes
ya ya ya ya you you have no control over this lah ya
yup
so probably just a bit more careful lah when how she speaks lah
yup yup yup yup yup yup
I mean one wishes it never happen in the first place but friendships will go up and down lah it's like that lah sometimes there are just little areas you don't go to finish ya ya I think it's it's it
it's the sort of thing that you think about when you are thinking about how valuable is this person to me what sort of a friend it is it's not just the happy moments that you will think about but it's also about the bad moments that you guys were able to patch up together and that I think really adds to the value of the friendship you know the amount of work you put into it
ya
yup
correct obviously there's a lot of censorship going on yes ya
friction
yup
yup
yup yup yup yup it's how you then deal with it together that matters
ya
ya ya ya
yes nisa likes to set boundaries you know I like I like I've learnt a lot about setting boundaries from how nisa does it I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with this so I'm not going to do it ya and and it's
it it comes as a surprise to people that I use it on I don't know if it's cause maybe when I say it I don't see it as nicely or sweetly as nisa but I've noticed a lot of people like eyebrows raised when I draw this kind of boundaries
I I really think that's missing ah in schools ah how to politely draw line you know
ah ah correct and it can be done very politely no one's trying to hurt your feelings here you know
ah ah ah ah
there was definitely silence after I said that like it hung in the room for awhile
three seconds then err then continue lah but I was
truly unapologetic cause it was too late at night and my brain was just ya not having it like I don't even have the capacity to have it even if I wanted to you know I don't have the capacity sorry it's too late
err
oh okay okay okay
oh okay so there is a possibility he might come is it oh okay cool
ah eh I can't talk now I'm sorry I'm doing the recording ah
oh oh ya dude we were just talking about you
or maybe he has left okay
okay so I don't know do you want like tackle the questions that we had okay we are halfway through so it's not too bad um but ya
it's taking a bit longer than expected cause I think it's cause the antibiotics are making my mouth like damn dry so next time I do this sia I need water need what what
god I hate this medication so much
huh natural things
no cause it's it it's means it put in effort if somebody just walks up to me and give it to me now I will gladly drink it I will so gladly drink it I just can't be asked even get up go to the toilet cause it hurts so I'm not gonna go and no I don't think so
I don't think so
did not reply to message until next day five o'clock like hello ya hi no not today I'm not coming today I got I got migraine
huh I don't know why the soldiers didn't cook in the tank sia
like steamboat ah oh inside the tank got aircon
singapore

memorable meal
you know I can't even think of one
okay maybe got one where my boss brings us to this like restaurant in bali it's called mosaic and it was super fucking posh and not just that but it was it took indonesian
and then wove it all into a menu that was that told a story ah from start to end and then at each point for each dish
that's such a great way to make it like another dimension you know to add on that's cool
off the top of your head

it was a nice walk home
today is
to get a response so I guess it hasn't been three weeks but I'm also a bit sad
accordingly lah cause I will be putting in a lot more work um then the other concern is also when I went online when I tried to look for like you know services like this kan
I want to lie in bed and watch
so I guess not having it is something we've been saying recently ah not having it
I I haven't heard it you started using it
not having it
no mood ah

and I'm so incapacitated
okay so that was memorable meal

okay so this is
ah actually it is I like this things

mm mm
so confidently
ya he had a very good err speaking persona unlike unlike his other there's one other colleague girl I think was quite good
but there was know there was one guy that I was like like making serious enquiries lah about how much actually is it gonna cost me to come up with my own anterrium and all these and he was
a bit like don't really answer the question and will roam the point a bit before getting into it be like oh okay
of course

ah ah ah ah

I don't know they were fun haiya I definitely went through a period of them I even use to shoplift them these romance novels ya man but then you know what I do or not will take out and then put the ones I took the last time

that's so cute ah ah ah
ya
right okay
yup
yup
yup
these kids ah
ya how beautiful what a gorgeous story
ya ya ya ya
so a lot of brown people step forward lah as supposed to chinese people little things like that you know
and it didn't occur to me even that I had that I didn't have this privileges
that wasn't my point my point was one guy towards the back of the room who obviously grow up with a lot of privileges crying ah sobbing like a baby cause that exercise got to him to the point where he just felt like
had it right but no lah the the it's just the way he cried it it really reminded me of what you were saying about the younger people in who see the world a bit differently but then they don't understand why everything cannot be equal you know whereas for us
so then maybe that was a shock to our system compared to them who was already born with a world where you cannot expect anything will happen at any time ya maybe for them it's a different way of looking at things I don't know
sundilah
ah
that was really weird and and tone deaf I thought this this election got a lot of things that were tone deaf ah from the side
firm that may not have I don't know many people that are representatives I don't know man
people's voice kan
ah ah
I see I see I see
ya ya ya ya
your vote now
ya I don't think it matters
for singapore supporting the government cause of covered walkways
sundilah it's one hour
okay then one two three

I'm planning to lik
two lah because the um the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle lah early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before lah ah
err so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
err
so it doesn't make sense lah to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
ah the one definite lah
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take lah bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first lah it's either my side or his side lah
so that's why the the the budget is a concern lah
um
oh it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
chey
err they have catering they have decoration with including the err plumbing also and then err they include the door gift
and then err tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford lah if I cannot commit to tha
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off mah so like err very proud you know finally you know somebody err my my child is getting married or whatever but the
alah they don't know the the cost to get tha
err there's no need for any vehicle lah I mean there's only just need one way lah just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
ah that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that ah want to get ready just go dow
burning hair to think of i
I suggested to my mum lah like come lah to meet me and give me advice lah
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity kan because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
but then because is they have to top up more s
uh manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west lah so uh it's not a location that is suitable for wedding lah it's more to like education wis
ah so err they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so um no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
ah so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that uh
became because of that also one good thing lah I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore err
ya lah the week after the wedding lah she will do that means like I think mayb
within december lah she'll she'll do honeymoo
it'll take about like a yea
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know lah as usual pay me but then
the groom side is giving a gift lah to the bride side is i
is it err oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
ya ya true dare to it y
err so is there a magazine is through Facebook lah so this lady was cheated and um you know I jus
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
that's the thing lah and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically kan you need to have okay ah for example like that that that particular location at orchard err it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that oh if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people lah ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course lah about thirty dollar plus plus and then leh I compared those tw
they only offering two then drinks also is like oh asia's err hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company lah not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then uh there was one time err the package includes brida
you compared the price of each eh to a brida
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
um we will only book one event for one da

ya
can lah I don't mind then I can cook something for you guys and then we can just chill and then we can catch up
so far I think they're okay just that the girl is going to primary one now
so I'm not so sure how is she going to cope
I'm actually looking for a tuition teacher now for her do you think I'm crazy
ya but singapore is so competitive I'm just worried about her
hais
what do you think
ya but last time you don't have this stress now everything is about good marks good school hais stress lah
mm but I still think like we need
a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young eh you got any tuition friend or not
tuition teacher
ah but I think there are different rates for this
maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house lah I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know
good good thank you thank you
eh so uh you wanna sit down somewhere like coffeeshop or something
where got atas you lah you work in what museum don't know what I not working eh
ya lah why
ya lah my
wait lah
ya
actually true lah because every time I fetch my kids ah then I see the maid like
just on their phone ah then never never even like take care of the kids some of them just allow the kids to run haiya crazy ah I don't know why this
these err their bosses ah never check on them
abuse
ya lah so
abuse what you mean by you abuse
so serious
orh you see lah I stay home so long ah never even read news hais I think I must start reading news to keep up myself
ya eh now COVID then how they want to engage maid
can or not ah
I think I rather stay home
keep my home clean
mm
mm
five days
so
oh
wah
hmm
mm
mm
uh huh
oh mm
stress at work
mm
ah
eh mm now got what exhibition over there
wow mm
but
mm
mm
mm
so a lot of people uh take leave
eh you redeem already
hmm
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
orh
mm
ya that's true
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go johor at least I make a bit more profit
mm
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
mm
ya that's true lah eh you know about talking about government ah they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
ah then my friend tried it then
well
know
ya
mm
mm
mm
kan the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
mm
mm
mm
mm but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country lah but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go um
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
mm
ya that's true
mm
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have um
enough people it's about
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless lah
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
daily ah mm
mm
mm
wah eh you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
mm mm
okay
mm
ah
mm
hmm
oh
fifteen dollars per hour
mmhmm
hmm
expose lah
oh
mm
precautionary order at mm
housewife just like me
mm
mmhmm
they know better lah
mm
mm
mm
that's true
eh ah I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
mmhmm
huh
is
we'll see
uh huh
a few cartons
mm
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
hmm
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
can lah if not you can just order in
mm
ya that's true
mm but it's quite expensive lah but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
eh
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
mm
mm
hmm ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle lah but lucky he is not using because he's uh on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
mm
ya that's true
hmm
ya that's true
mm
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched lah I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
hmm
some of them even went to uh try
wah it's really you have to work extra hard for this uh
mmhmm
mm
oh
oh
mm
that's long
mm maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying uh well
mm
oh
mmhmm
mm
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then um my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of um what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive lah on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
um having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
mm
mm
mm
ya
mm
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary kan
mmhmm
ya

uh huh
mm

okay
especially during
you will your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm ah
so ya and then like
okay lah they teach you a lot about like
ah regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
it's miserable lah everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
ah that's what I used to think lah because
when I when I became a recruit at tekong I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life ah
but honestly when
into inventory
is basically ah
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like times ten ah
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then you are treated nicely what
no no
when I went to kranji camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
is like
even even though you are treated fairly ah but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
ah basically you are treated like
like less than human ah
then
but not as often
ya way better ah but
I even though is hard right
is the I think once I right
I will really miss it ah all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
like I managed to go through it
ya
ya one year pass by what
is like I have a bear with it
so ya but I got a lot of achievements ah is something that I didn't expect that I can do
is like is really like
break your
your capabilities what you are capable of
ah
ya okay
okay so
basically my
achievement right okay
when I
before I the twenty four not much
from the first day we move up from five
and we finish the next day at two working with all the maximum load with all weapons and
and then I'm left with like
four kilometres left right to the marina float
cannot even feel my own legs ah
it's like
like is the most miserable thing ever
but the thing that makes you like really push on because you know that your family is going to see you
so I uh
and then like
you know that someone is waiting there
and then like and then the the fun thing is
and then I I let them um try on my bag ah my full pack
hmm all ah
all of them
and then like oo no I don't want to carry this again
and then okay lah that is that is twenty four K that is so big ah
and then
the another one is when I got my green beret
um
the send us out
to lim chu kang cemetery
at three three or two thirty
and then I was inside the bus looking out the window
I'm like oh my god S A F
who who who who who does things like these two come on and then is two until like
that same day eight we didn't even stop
ya and then at eight at night that is where they presented us our beret then like
wah shiok ah hmm
hmm
happy of course lah
if is like you will not just happy that we got the beret because we are happy with
I don't want to do that thing anymore that's why we are happy when we we are the most happiest when we are inside the civilian bus back to get camp
it's like aircon imagine in jungle
and then like soft cushioned your your transitioning from laying down on the soil
err
uh is that bad you know one of my friend who
you know about tekong water
the our water doesn't come from new water it comes from a reservoir from tekong
and the water have err certain minerals that is good for you
is very nature lah and then it's straight from the reservoir to the water cooler
and it taste it taste like ugh it taste so bad
and then there's this one point where during the confinement week my buddy the toh
ah you don't know err military term toh that means ah basically you pass out ah or you just fall out ah some sort like that
during exercise no no he just wasn't feeling well and he passed out on the first parade
so he was sent out
and then err he
and then in the few days he head back and then he ask me eh you want to taste singapore water or not
it's like
because that plain water is so nice
and tekong isn't the duh eh ya
oh eh ah
but okay lah
army life is
is fun but
you know you don't want to be a soldier ah
no it will get harder from here your your infant your inventory kan is
like you are
even even our
who's that guy's name our
brigade ah
wah so I forgot his name his position lah
ah
brigade ah you say
like is a dog's life ah inventory is just a dog's life
is is expected everyone like suffer
you to ask is the
one of the worst vocation to be in ah
because like
they say it's a singaporean son experience ah
ya
and then once you finish
uh six november
two thousand twenty one is still a long way to go
oh ya ya ya
you want to know ah okay so basically
err I want to
basically I'm going to be jobless for the first six months ah
and then um
I will be training my girlfriend
first six months ya ya because basically
I I want to do a portfolio ah
like if you um
take my
if you hire me as your coach ah
so ya I want to be like a trainer ah
the isn't isn't is not is
it's a future that is not promise to you
like if as if like you have a job when you have a job like all your promise like are going to get paid monthly just
you just follow orders and just do your your own stuff and then
but this one is like you are not confirm that you going to make it or not
so is very stressful
so it's like
it's like you're gambling you're gambling it away ah you gambling all your savings away ah
I like that's why I like trying to save up money for my after life
so ya
and I plan to also
compete
um
compete err
national like lah ah eh not national
err like
a classic
classic bodybuilding ah
and then like
why why would should I wasted I have been training for ten years
and I should make the experience worth it and then like complete
so everyone know who I am
what
yes of course
a'ah
how long will it take
for me to get the physique I really wanted
assure already competitions like ah showed any physic
after you only I can build back by six months
because
there's such thing as muscle memories since I lost my muscle to
so it's like I can build back everything or even better in six months
so like
handsome ah
okay
okay
um
um ya
okay
hmm
oh damn
okay but
sorry what
err
okay lah some sort lah
okay
um
so basically your
home based business ah
okay
means okay lah singaporean pursuit what
hmm
will I am black eyes peas
ah
will progress ah
ah
so if you are successful in your selling of clothes
hmm
no no no no no what I mean is
if your business is like a daily product progressively successful right
okay
hmm
hmm
hmm um
there will be any other platform that will take over what
ya but right now like facebook is killing it ah
like but there will be a day where facebook will die out and then other social media social media platform that will take over
tiktok tiktok
oh but no no I never use tiktok ah to me
ya
alah
why
ah but
the funny right is like
two out of ten eh
so is like two of them
or one sometimes is one one of them is funny and then another nine of them right you keep pressing
the tap the screen to skip when like nine of it is like you watch and then it's not funny at all then you waste you time
then
okay swipe up lah sorry lah that I saw people use tiktok right is basically like that after one thing they show another thing they show another thing and then like
and then like the first one is funny and then the other nine is not and then you are wasting your time I rather like use youtube because you can learn a lot from it
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about err
like photography and photoshop
so basically err after I
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right
err like
really like edit pictures really well photography like
quality studio near
quality ah
so it's like I get like followers ah
err it's like honestly eh
what I heard from my member as duh
come forward to tell like eh I'm training people people approach him so what if right you you're the person that give your service
and then ya can you imagine
no ya it's a good idea and then
ya ya
ya is like very popular
gym shark
hmm mm
ya lah yoga pants lah oo what lah shaker bottle
supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and hey bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different ah
ya
ya
that's why I want to buy a soft box
you know those ah
the basically like a umbrella and then there is a light bulb inside
and then the light bulb like really shines like
and then like so it's look like really good ah that's why I also want to buy new phone
eh S twenty is good ah
oh no to me
technology now kan
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
so technology right now is like
is good ah how is progressing ah
ya ya mm S twenty plus ah
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone ah I bet you like taking photos right
mm
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
no just ask them any camera phones that
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio
if it's both good they're willing to stay
most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game ah
right when you think about it you need to up your game also like
what like your camera quality lah
ya
oh
um mm
okay
okay eh but if you plan to upgrade your phone right
then what type of phone do you want
this olympic athlete he is the
ya
kan
oh ya ya like if you have like like a premium
collection or what kan
there's like one clothes is like sixty dollars
then the shipping price is like worth it
can you imagine if the shipping price is higher than the actual dress people like huh why would I do that
why would I do that
okay
okay
okay
but
that means you need good lighting is not the camera
okay
don't use V S C O it's not good use photoshop
okay
mm
troublesome ah
photoshop you can get it for free
over time you'll get so good at it that you don't have to even think
mm
photoshop no lah you need you need that's why I told you is practice you ask a person let say into photography you ask ah
can you edit a
can you put my ear on my forehead
serious you just need practice
um
ya lah
I used to use photoshop ah once you know like how to do it
it's okay lah it's just arrange and repeat
okay okay lah then mm ya of course
mm
body shop eh
okay
ya is
what's going to be ah huh I can't wait I'm left with like one more year
oh man I can't wait
because after that I will finish my tech
you know you know wis a tech
a tech is basically the final exam so basically
um we go to war
with another company
the full of the company full of food just regulars like regular sign on
men
and
their life really
so is like you're fighting against people that really know the jungle
so ya and high chance that you will die
so and is quite quite long lah but what I heard is that whenever they say paradise now right
after like a tech right you know what's a paradise now
it means mission complete so when they say paradise now means
ah then you're done already ah
it's now it's paradise you have nothing to worry about them
the last two months of your right
should be everyday
what I heard is
you booking
on sunday
um like midnight I think I hopefully ah
and then I woke up the next day at three
so basically I
I'm staying overnight ah
mm
ya that's basically our job alah
like thirty percent of is also is becoming a cleaner
I'm not kidding
is
you know there's there's no cleaner in a camp
we are the cleaners
there's no cleaner at all
um except for canteen
we clean it
some sort like specialised thorough cleaning
where soldiers are we not like ah
they don't hire us specially for
but we have always to clean toilet ah every week
every week clean toilet clean bunk clean corridor clean gym
clean clean lamp clean parade square
mm
you you have to clean oh kitchen what right
mm
mm
your practical practical kan
of course lah is
your
I bet there would be
labelled for doing certain things like for example
like um in camp
we have one idiot
mm
okay
um
ya lah you what secondary school eh
college
mm
mm
mm
okay
okay
confirm you the most irritating one I bet
shy one
mm
wah
luckily you're not in army sia
because they have things like this
like um like my position is like I'm
second in charge in for company eh no no
uh platoon six
so basically I'm some sort like under the
is like you have to do jobs like as you
you are a sergeant
and then
everytime before we move out for a mission
they have like a briefing briefing room only two will be there
so basically our commanders will give us what to do how to attack everything
like they they draw on the whiteboard
and then
after that we go back to our what section
and then we'll build them
um
I no
I wanted to be I wanted to be a commander not a two
I wanted to lead because of the pay
right now I lead I have the same pay as a trooper
okay okay
hmm
mm
ya lah
I know
depends on the depends on your bully
depends on to what extent
and then
when because
everytime everytime like
whenever he's he's trying to chase a girl
he will put on this like this personality
like okay there's this one time
wah he says skater
that's because he wants to impress someone
so funny like what
is is like ah
like I really miss my life ah
um what do you mean which one li only have one life ya
oh two campus ah no but I love my life ah choa chu kang
that that one you ah cannot blame your stupidity lah
because you you don't want to said it like I live at choa chu kang then I go back to balestier when there's a choa chu kang campus there ya lah
so I agree lah you agree to my statement ah thank you so much nurse nurse is see me
oo but college central is such a big school eh
once I went there to collect my award after like I graduated right
err my my my brain is like melted when I saw that school
why
um
that's why I love primary school it's so cute so small
and then like your class so near and then yay recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life lah
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in
but back in poly ah it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time lah outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something lah
that I can
work lah but
honestly I don't want to ah I don't want to be electrical engineer
eh in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold schwarzenegger at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
wah
there's a lot of foreign talent
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
oh ya ya
um ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end wins right
um
P P
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
mm
is it like your your challenging the students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school eh let's say for example most everyone went to and they know what is taught there
but but your is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs
sorry my mistakes
okay
um ya
singapore is quite messed up ah
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
you see ah
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like
um
ya ya
but okay lah what
I think like
the next generation you won't feel so far
hopefully
stone aged stone aged ah like indonesia
ya ya ya eh
mm
okay
oo oh ya we do
okay
mm but singapore job is still a thing ah
cause requirement is to speak mandarin

I heard there's a lot of barber shop ah nowadays
ya but I saw it's like forty dollars what's so special about the forty dollars sia
but it's more I I don't know if actually I I I really cannot afford lah
got tattoo lah you know for normal people ah I will scared lah
ya
ya but normally
when I go there I sit down
ya but I normally go there only when I go reservist ya to make my hair short ah
ya
same ah
ya same same
ya but during circuit circuit breaker what you do actually
ya
ya but I remember that time we always zoom
we zoom every I don't know once
one week I don't know three or four times sia we zoom
it's fun but I but I don't think we
ya is different ah I don't know ah to me is very weird ah
ya ya
ya I think we are lucky lah we got friends who are like
ya
ya
ya
wah but some countries more more strict ah I think
all this lockdown ah like europe ah like our friend ah our spanish friend
wah that one
but that one that one more worse you know they cannot even go out to have a job
oh ya they cannot go out have a job lah only and and they very control lah
sometime you can only go out for one hour go buy groceries then you come back
ya
oh ya ya
ya so
ya
ya
your band how ah

ya last saturday I came here at
eight eh no seven plus ah I come here seven plus

ya of course
ya must make things exciting ah
for for not just for the band for everyone ah

not alone cause couple you can get a lot of err loans and err whatever other stuff
ya
ya

ya
ya but the best I think
after you play then you make friends

okay let's start
ah yes
ya lah we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya lah
ya so I think what we can do we don't go uh we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual lah we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in ah
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay lah uh we can take the the voucher ah you want to buy the voucher ah meaning we have to go uh the
err
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course ah
no lah the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before what just like the night safari
the four items ah the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
err
think eleven plus ah
oh uh wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge ah seven plus to nine
two you uh ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this one right
uh we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going what you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go lah
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also lah can
the three of them
but if affaf don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two lah
then it's two two each
Subway
mm ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough lah don't know ya
have to
is the camera uh waterproof
don't have ah
can
her studies finish already what her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
err
affif I think he doesn't want to go down
eh what
twentieth right
the following week lah after christmas
can eh no cannot
yes uh uh
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have ah not open yet ah okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups lah so the kids
all the children
add up uh
it's just nice
force lah
monday
that's why first person to check is aisyah
but if you I I don't know whether
err
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say lah you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
uh ya lah there is a few suggestion lah one is
um we split into two groups
so one group is maybe uh
ya
go to the one that is more lah kan
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there lah
so affif affaf shafie three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind lah because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya lah
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many uh eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line ah and it's too um
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
ah
amin I mean we all have been coming over
we ah mahir because the other time his family come over amin come over amin the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how ah
uh
ya lah uh we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest amin would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
uh at one time at one go
and then err
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay lah then after that
of course lah
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
ah apply
just that maybe amin uh only
the two older eh umar also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if umar is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
mm
right okay so what else ah do you want to talk about um
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya lah
very difficult
ya cannot one
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone what we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options lah so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay lah at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that one
no the problem is
all others in singapore lah unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to what
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
um the problem with all other uh uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's uh and her lecturer one whom she took the last course kan
then she the lecturer actually say um
that
a topic module not on in these two uni lah
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write ah ah correct
so she's uh worried about the that part lah that's why
uh huh ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya lah
they actually have it leh the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants ah
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
err
mm more working people are opting for that course more working people tau meaning people who are
let's say they uh they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us lah she uh or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student ah so she will be like considered as an adult already lah
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say uh
err income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
ah but actually that one not much lah
of course lah because she is ah
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
uh
ya lah
like that lah
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have uh all these other
unis ah which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
oh my god that's why I was
ya lah because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating lah
ya so that one actually I thought uh I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya lah
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things lah so and she went in they were all telling her oh you know uh this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like affaf are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop uh
K so
we need another
ya we need another uh
round of her checking lah ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya lah
that's what he wants to do
so
ya lah she
lah
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based lah so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics lah right that's physics right
so more about physics
ah so you learn how to make
the uh you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya lah you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
um
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application uh by this person
who wants to uh uh okay because I put up uh a post
ah resale
ya okay so two ah one is about the
um recruitment
uh I put
teacher coach uh at SAM lah
so so far
uh
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she uh she apply but we are maths kan so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
ah that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because uh we already signed up what it's for free at that point in time lah
uh when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say uh this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
uh about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
ah
switch her lah
ya
ya lah paying the teacher only
correct lah
so okay lah so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
um a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
oh my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run ah let it run ah
so the partnership confirm don't want ah so I will message to say don't want ah
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya lah the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
ah
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right ah
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue lah from there kan
okay so
progress report I told ira to do that already
ah the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to ira right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of ira you said to ira directly
I was there so I think it's okay lah let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out lah
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give uh first week july then we didn't give
so this one at least we give lah everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya lor
but then
buy over then he buy over lah
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
uh for uh the person who takes over is a full time
owner
tau so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved lah
uh in
ya sort of like that lah ya correct
but I was thinking actually no lah uh yang was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut lah so I think he can
ya lah he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said lah a bit
you know I said uh uh in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot ah then I say during and all ya ya ya
uh I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only ah I can understand a bit but
uh chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say oh because
uh nearby our place uh it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so uh a lot of uh
uh
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
ah
then then uh because of that
um we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
oh okay okay but now got Google translate what
can just uh tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear lah
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say oh but the children can speak english what so the children can explain I say yes
um we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had uh chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy lah
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just oh okay
ah ah
ah that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct lah ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be uh with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
uh uh he's a graduate
ah
so he was working
uh but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
oh okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe lah
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like oh okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better uh candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
ah so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
err do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well uh and and starts in his course lah so he was saying
he understand children uh who have difficulty in maths lah he can he can relate so he knows uh
mm
ya
mm
ya
ya
ya
ya lah
ya lah so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said lah give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit lah sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method
is more suited for a big classroom you in front of the class
ya
ya
ya K lah can we will
tell that to the
to the boy tomorrow

she went down to the shop she saw her husband
ya she talked to to ah the person lah the Aminah but she never talked to the husband lah
ya she was there
no she only have seventy dollars like what
I mean but but we are so lucky that we are we never take a lot lah eh
ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty
but then again I don't know I until when she's gonna do this cause
at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
mm
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week ah fourth month uh fourth week
mmhmm
oh in fact she mmhmm
ya ya true
then suddenly become her husband delivery friend whatever
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct Thai supplier cause she is the one who gave Aminah Muslim this number the contact lah so
that's why
kan so she is going to go babe this kind of thing eh once you do this kind of thing eh maybe you get shiok with it ah you get carried away with this scam kan but the you still can pay is okay you know but once you cannot pay ah that's it your name will be viral all over the social media I'm telling you honestly
kan
mm oh really
where you saw outside or
mmhmm
she selling at twenty two dollars or something like that if I'm not wrong
but but but then again uh they take from the same supplier the one that I order lah
ya that's the thing
I think you gonna like it
also not sellable
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm baby will be sending on Thursday night is it
and then this one I want to ask her to give me the orders by by tomorrow lah actually she already give ah later lah this wholesale lah I don't know she want or not
then Thursday she have to transfer to me
ah ya but Su Muhammad
ya like like real like that ah
mmhmm like ours ah like the ruffle dress I thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
kan
mmhmm no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell lah I don't know why
ah like like ya
ah yes yes like Natalie Bella you see Natalie Bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what I mean
so ya I think we need to invest lah but then again I don't see lah we don't need to take a lot of stocks lah anyway for me lah eh I don't really
mmhmm
yes
true
defects
they will ask for a refund
and you know to to to run the shop
but if to to be in a shop everyday I don't think I'm looking forward to that cause that's not where I see myself as unless maybe I don't know my my son and daughter grow up
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm I did a flea market before
no
perfume
mmhmm
ya looks like it ah
mm
open and then clear ya it's just like our live lah sometimes I don't want to open this you know but then I have to open it
mm
ya
ya the man ya
ya but ya I think but once in a while maybe once a month can do this flea market stuff but not like every week you have to do this flea market I'm not into that looking forward to any like you know every week I have to go to a flea market cause for me is much more on you know home-based I don't know I mean some people have big dreams lah but I I don't see I don't know how about you
ya I mean I I love to go to a flea market but but then again like you said setup and cleaning up and then manpower I mean you have to have manpower for it lah
which is mmhmm
mm
mm
ya about nine
ya you know like the event in the make up you know like the what last time they always have this exhibition all lah what is it called
what is it ah expo expo all these eh bazaar is it a mini bazaar oh my god I I I I've been seeing I did a bazaar before ah last time I was working in the bazaar ramadan
making bubble tea eh
when I was a teenager I still remember that that bubble tea was a new craze you know that time I was in
sec three or sec four lah that time
and it's very tiring seh it's very tiring oh my gosh
mmhmm boss
mm some more we will have to think of the money
ya true
so
mm
I think I think
ya rather than you have some live you see they have to go to the shop as well cause they have a shop so they do it in a shop so like I said I'm not looking I don't know maybe in ten years time maybe I don't know like what I'm doing right now is just for a supplementary to my income
ah she wants to quit her job yes
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
mm
she offered she offered but I don't want
knowing her you see how different ah from that live with my live
mmhmm
anyway if I do for her it's I never come out the money what
right so she is the boss
babe the friend staying condo lah the friend shipped ah buy the stocks lah cause when I heard the live ah she said self-collect at Woodlands not at Tampines
so it's from the house
oh somebody is crying is it
what to do eh cat fighting nature nature
ya
what
so okay lah I hope this conversation doesn't leak out ah
no no but I'm I'm going to I'm going to give her back lah in her own time ah I don't want to sell for her anymore lah but I don't want to make it so obvious lah you know
ah ya ah but I don't want to make it actually in fact I don't after the incident
mmhmm
mm
true true we are you see we are left with only a few dress only like one or two three Thailand dress ah I ordered five Thailand dress now I'm left with three Thailand dress
ten dresses ya and then baby will be twenty pieces right already a lot of people reserve

botanical garden

ya it's err very bare minimum nothing really to see a lot we don't get to see alter we only get to see the model
ya
and it's moving definitely that's why I'm like away from me just in case
when the moment you say that what if it's gonna jump I'm like oh god okay I'm gonna back off girl back off now
you
damn
oh my god they can
oh damn damn
ya I think I was very young let me see primary school then we went to the zoo that was very small also so when I look at it the alligator like the biggest thing I've seen in the tank like super huge to me
I was like fuck this is like what a dinosaur alligator or what
ya and I will most like lead my way towards where they gonna feed the crocodile cause I didn't know that is like a way for the for the rangers rather than for the people
and then they have to shout like come down what you doing there come back now oh there's where we feeding the alligator come down oh no cause I was like run back down
mengheadache
err
chey
hmm
like
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in pulau ubin or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
ah there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two
ya that's crazy
ya
mm
I'm in a mess I'm in panic mode
ya so
I just
so one day when she's going to macritchie I got slapped on my face by a monkey so ya
but not the older one
you have a lot of acts a lot of emotion has developed
and they're trying to steal your bottles you don't bring any food or drinks you know
pulau ubin
ya
the mangrove
monkeys ya
no eh
uh oh no
hop on her bag
ya
ya
bottle cap
because he's very sneaky you know I assume it's a he lah I don't see the bird bird or what you know
they were on the rail bridge and then the monkey look at me
so I'm just going to like okay I just shut up let him do his business so the monkey go and took the bottle water away
mmhmm
okay
alright
oh
mmhmm
mmhmm
what the heck
okay
alright
oh
oh my god
oh my god
ah ya ya ya
mm mm mmhmm
it's crazy
oh my god
oh my god
what do you do
wah this teacher scold
ya lah
mm
mmhmm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
ears
okay
uh huh
ah
mm mm
uh huh uh huh
to whack ah uh
oi
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really ah
I went I went ostrich farm
then
ah
they don't really like um sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
and the baby like bathing the babies
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
is it birds
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
uh huh
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have leh
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
mmhmm
oh
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous ah
now cause
oh my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
oh what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve sia
just crucial
ya
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else ah food err shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
mm
mmhmm
they have the
assertion
two weeks
mm higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know lah what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was ah
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself lah he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
hospitalised
ya
kan
ah
uh huh
same ya
phase two
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think the annoying part is like okay ah aside from business lah like how the work function now is
so um
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment ah rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible lah
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course err because of your work function ah but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office oh
it depends on your work already mah
ya
ya
mm
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings ah weddings most affected ah
a batches
ya so we got our friend wedding coming up in november
err but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective lah who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person ah that kind of thing ah but also she can't be very
restrict lah about two who would potentially can be invited
um
it's just err sad lah didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
mm mm
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
yup
mmhmm
ya
um hmm
ya must come to terms lah
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
really
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth eh it's not breathing out
ya
I see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always I think now they gone crazy with social media and Facebook Instagram all this or YouTube
it's the best thing for them lah
social media the next thing ah
so I think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven
I'm like fifty something ya and then now they started to like uploading things on Facebook try to get to know the the the rad the world of online it's madness
kan but okay what do you what do you what do they normally watch
old songs
me watch
uh huh
me watch is not really friendly user I felt like you you know you must know lah a lot of scrolling ah I felt
they can still not not bad
ya talk about dad my dad is crazy with hindustan
so he's been watching an app
hindustan movies my mum like crazy about the whatever is happening in indonesian so she almost know every celebrity in indonesia itself and talk about their lives this one split lah this one got new babies lah this one wah she can tell me the whole story

oo then what type of sport do you prefer then
mm
mm
hmm
alamak

mm
mm
then

it's a unique course I would say
ya and err this course is like it appeals to me lah because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
mm
oo so
oh so recently I just uh finish my semester one so some of the courses I sorry I mean modules I picked was
I did was uh design and colour so I do like graphic designs and stuff and I also uh besides coding I also learn uh concept

mm
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally uh do uh my hobbies
yeah
yep
go for the trials err because I um I'm actually afraid of rejection
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then um so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
wah how was it
yeah
oh for what
oh
mm
ah
yeah
mm
oh
wow
ya man I can't imagine myself
wah all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
then

the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
uh it can be done but it's just very hard
my course is interaction design kan so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm uh ideas together and then come up with like uh a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting lah because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
uh how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
ya that's about it
for you eh
mm
why kay you tell me
how rabak
wah I legit also don't like this type of people leh like they really make my blood go up eh like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to ah take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works lah

how about I smacking
what
when
what thing
then don't bother much about wallets
but I'm a child
ya ya ya

currently I haven't get my letter lah but
um
err
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me lah over good looks but
err
if I had to pick one then
how about you
err
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body lah but for good looks err if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it what so it's all down to genetics
err
err to fit body
err hopefully lah can you know live a healthier life and err not have any like
err
wah your question so deep
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
ya
so
but if you look at other countries um a bit more difficult to control lah especially if the country is very big right and
err maybe they are more how to say like social like
could be a reason lah if let's say like scientists err cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
how about you what you think
you know from all this err
hunger and starvation maybe like
err people will like the population will eventually get reduced lah cause
um
if if this I mean don't know lah maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa lah of course other countries also you see the
mm ya ya
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
oh
mm err
I mean
better like not say change myself lah but like err how to say like relate to them and like
err whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly lah
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level lah
then maybe another skill would be like
err
like the kind err it comes together with like
err performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like um
err that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence lah I mean is err it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
err then
it's it's good lah in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
is more towards um
like
err
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just err accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said lah in the condition given is that
so like
err
increase my wealth from there lah whenever the stock market go up I can just err sell it if not I just hold on to it lah until the value is a good time to sell lah
ya
ya
for me ah probably
ability to teleport lah
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time lah like
even then like
is is not a problem lah you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower lah I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like err maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing lah that
err would would benefit like
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
err
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say lah with great power comes great responsibility kan so like
um
um
I feel like it's beneficial lah because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
this err insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
mm
I mean
err I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
but
like
err whatever the case lah basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest err performance lah
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
they all look up to me as this err strong fit buff guy then
um
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
these so called good label can be um
will come after you lah because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
is down lah like
ya
so when you go into the spiral then um
err just lay down in bed just like
like
um this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look ah like good like physical look
all err
they just err placed on me lah ya
okay lah
that's one but
um of course devote some portion of day to the person lah like
err partner
like
so
I mean
my my day will most likely be like
err going to work and all that then like
err I I still like to keep fit lah as I grow older so um
if possible
err
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
err athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
it's a it's a thing lah I feel like
err
very very important to you know err commit yourself to the other person
of course it will include cost lah but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person lah so that would be that would be ideal for me lah ya
err ya then
I feel lah that would be ideal for me lah because it's something I really enjoy and it
err
ya
but
err more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine lah ya anyway like
like
your muscle will build up but
err
especially if it's like a a decently long ride lah
it takes time lah so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in err
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
err girlfriend lah ya

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
oh have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction lah television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
uh the other twin his ukrainian
um she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised uh she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress uh tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
um uh who is one of the clones lah
then she always uh live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming uh compared to season two and season four
mm I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones uh usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this lah
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember lah because this is the current show I'm watching now
um
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it lah so you won't get err you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil lah because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended uh without spoiling it for you
err I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes uh actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's uh probably safe to check out ah because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
oh okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout lah
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse uh them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like uh draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you lah I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your uh interview outfit
um don't need tie ah I guess err maybe just a formal wear including uh smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive uh and also be open lah
a'ah
mm
okay
oh I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's ah creepier and more real it's um it's not is not a comedy like orange orange kan orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent ah ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for uh uh why you like
oh um I mean for me err I'm waiting for money heist uh wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons ah
ya ah ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya uh my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show uh I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
oh ya
mm
ya ya
oh so you think you like a professional critic ah
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about uh about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident uh raquel losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real lah if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season uh but it was very entertaining to me ah also quite compelling and way better in spanish um ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
uh uh the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this uh money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions ah but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated lah anyway so today is twelve twelve uh sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full uh a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
mm I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at uh ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of uh sneakers on sale
mm
I am looking for air fryer
uh
no I'm busy mm I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding ah strider balance bike for azam
second
uh carousell so I found one uh uh that can deal at buangkok but uh he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
oh okay lah why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay lah firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand uh second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but uh the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly lah
it depends on his father's uh interests and free time
ya so have you thought about azri's suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
uh if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in uh government sector uniform group like uh prison service uh um I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive eh but you need to read more lah you need to do more research uh but there's bond lah I think err since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this uh uniform group then you should uh still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself ah that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
uh I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya mm
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
oh so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
uh their degree are sponsored by the company ah ya I mean like for example um
mm
so rolls royce pay for his degree
oh that's good so uh as he get as he ah got the degree right so did his salary also uh goes up went up
oh okay that's good can I ask what is his position
oh okay five years eh mm so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his uh recommendation do you don't you want to work there
oh okay okay
mm interesting rolls royce okay
oh so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him lah you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so wah when he joined what was his uh education uh certificate diploma so so he join uh it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant uh then he gets to stay there with his family
mm ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house lah well that's good that's good so so he so he's uh he told you that he signed bond for five years with uh
five years okay so uh is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree oh okay I think uh singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face ah
oh it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but ah but who will pay for this uh school the company or the company will reimburse
oh that's good
if you have to stay until the company
mm that means err work and study ah ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
oh really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good um
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so err for a wait
when when did when did I said err when err I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then um
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
mm so what she working as now oh searching
almost a year so until now no job
oh okay so did she graduate from or
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so uh maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then uh then can just move on lah
anyway
so uh what's the status about your bike
uh the so when is it going to change the
uh cover set what's the plan
yes
okay so meaning still need to do something to the bike so this time is engine not the exhaust okay both so the mechanic still in process me ah in a way he grew there
okay very good
uh okay um good to hear ah hopefully it will not extend beyond january
okay why to bring the bike to go where
fireworks ya so um
what's the plan for you and your hundred dollar voucher actually
so
okay ya ya they have to queue for more than four hours at uh orchard hotel
where you know about this
oh okay okay someone like review
what hotel is that do you know
oh okay concord um it's quite old anyway um so about this uh we were talking about your job right so you're you graduated with uh diploma in engineering correct engineering informatics so pretty much is engineering lah okay like azri's job
uh like ah azri's job um that one is more to or engineering
mostly it's engineering electrical rovers
okay
oh assistant engineer ah
mmhmm
oh is it

ya
uh any particular companies that you are eyeing for
tivo ya
okay so do you know if they are hiring
maybe you just get the email then can just drop her an email if it's the same person lah
mm okay okay then um
so that means you just mentioned just now uh how about okay it also open right
so is that something that you can see yourself doing oh okay okay
okay okay okay so depends on what is it lah ya also not choosy right for now okay that's good then so for uniform group okay that's good okay um okay let's see

okay
err ya of course I prefer err advanced planning so I don't like it when um err for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
err but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel um annoyed is when
err actually someone lied to me you know like um behind my back it's just really annoying
so um ya
err that's one thing that will make me
really angry
ya
yes
ya
okay

ya I can see that okay
emotional so you can express your feelings through music
ya okay ya true

orh okay not that gore loud kind of thing lah okay okay

mm
you know like start err and plan is is kind of like difficult for me and to to to do a you know like trial
ya
ya
yes ya
ya right
ya and and
ya
yes ya so uh I mean twenty twenty eh to be honest has been such a tough err year for most of us like there's a lot of challenges but um this year is like um very interesting like something new for everyone so I'm just wondering about how next year
things will be like
ya
will that be your destination to your honeymoon consider lah okay
mm
okay
oh okay
okay
okay ya
ya new zealand new zealand
ya
cause I see like err
atmosphere so it it's nice you know ya can can consider for honeymoon
right
mm
okay
mm
oh okay so
correct
err I would love to err try out like the different kinds of
like um food but not I can see that my for my parents case they they are not open to try something new
our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
okay previously kan err I was studying overseas kan so err it was such a
still prefer to um to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
oh okay
ya
autumn okay
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to um
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
oh okay
ya
mm
okay
oh ya
okay
have you tried
bullet train okay okay
I see
but ya
but it's okay um
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
but okay um
uh does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to err having formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
err
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
um ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
okay
okay
mm ya
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
err you know I won't be scared of it but apparently uh ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
but how about um
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
mm
a bee stung ah
oh okay
ah okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
oh
did you shout
can you can you try to err you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
oh okay
went away ya
I I don't know the the name of the spider
hairy next so what kind of
ya ya ya oh no
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
mm
ya
so um
ya
carry err
okay okay
okay
you tried
oh
huh in thailand
okay
mmhmm
cocoon
okay mm
because err some people always say that okay obviously um the
err obviously is like um the the the insects that is sold um for you to like can be consumed they say that it's err clean but you know it's clean um
but I still find disgusting even though like um they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to um to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
err you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
orh
ya
ya ya ya
oh ya maybe probably ya but um
very interesting to see like uh maybe you you know err like like even when um when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
err is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a um they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them kan the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically um I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get um halal food because mostly err they eat like
yup okay
so I mean err
this is this is very interesting you know ya you know one thing that um I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have err been jumping a lot of topics but it actually err
you know connects us our conversation to to speak err
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we um when we we we talk is always on err whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can err do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
um
any any other questions that you want ask me
because I know you are a very curious person kan so probably you might want to ask
oh so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it oh it isn't the latest lah the latest kan is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay err ya I mean err it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
more to the back
ya
oh okay okay
but how about other android phones I mean android can be like samsung um err like err nokia you know all these
sony okay sony is um
the music err have good quality
camera okay I'm not quite updated I've been an iphone user
okay
okay
that's that's uh that's good
oh ya I think um ya that's quite ya the downside of it lah I mean we we've been paying
quite a hassle because usually the normal kan but then ya

one eight seven
I don't want to like rush myself so I was just like okay never mind just take direct bus
one eight seven kan normally is the single deck right so
like there's no space right even if like the seat is very crowded
but this one I got like the double deck one
cause you always Grab here is it or you don't really have a purpose to come to jurong
uh huh
side lah
mmhmm
so what you just have to take the train and then you take a bus or you still like you have to switch buses
some more peak hours right I cannot sia like there was once I worked at at like I think
like it was just tiring I was just more tired I dreaded going to school I don't mind being in school but then like I just dreaded being in like going to school
like my makeup gets smudged at the mask and all that
mm
mmhmm
honestly yeah I can understand
what's your plan I mean like err I there was like I wanted to ask you about something like I had plans
the other day
but uh I forgot
to I mean like I had I wanted to do plans with you but then I forgot about it then after that I remembered
err like a few months ago and then like COVID happened and then I feel like it just took
way longer for me to like text you about it
it's okay
yeah
mmhmm
yeah like uh I also was supposed to travel a lot this year
then like
then like err I was supposed to like travel for a few countries and stuff but then like
I I just didn't have I mean because of COVID it didn't happen and also like
like
I was supposed to go I think like um
you know the good vibes fest at um genting
yeah I was supposed to go there and I mean and I mean it was like my first
mmhmm
yeah Ramly burger at the side of the road oh my god I miss that you know it's always like
eat at night
mmhmm
oh yeah like that's really sad it's like those like side
of the road thingy right I had
a maid like who like lives in like she we still keep in contact with her after like
you know after she left um indonesia
but
yeah I mean like my we sent her some money lah like me and my
mm
I have an uncle that lives there like I remember like um during
because for them it's like
so like they couldn't leave they just like stayed there
like it was like still not stable at all you know I mean it was like the same here lah we couldn't like leave anything
I mean we could not like leave the house or anything for them it's just like
they can't do anything I mean they from what I know it's like theirs more strict
but everybody still tries to get out
which is really bad you know what I heard though like there are people who
yeah
mm
like honestly indonesians are not fazed by the
by like any sort of ghost
hmm
but like okay lah I mean like it's still a big change in the life right
what do you mean you're not you don't you're not in school like I mean don't you have like
you don't need you no you don't need to go to campus is it
mm
how is the exam going to be conducted do you have to go to campus this time
mmhmm
mmhmm
hmm
like
in the classroom then it's like just like everybody has to social distance
oh
mmhmm
honestly I mean like
it's hard to be motivated at a time like this right then like most of my classes now since I'm like self studying and then like and stuff like that like it's not
physical so it's always just like online
so it's like like you said lah it's like same goes to you I guess it's like really hard to focus and then it's just like for me I work best with one to one
but like technically this is one to one but not like directly in front of me so it's like a bit
hard to focus but I think I'm okay it's like
since it's september eh september now right it's like
end of next month which is like like the exams is end of next month which is like super fast in my opinion
is I think is in England it's here
yeah so but like they did
make amendments lah for the topics I guess cause is like
for example like the sec four topics right like some of them are redacted
removed and stuff because it's like they we don't have the time to like
they didn't have the time to like properly like teach us stuff
then like I know my paper they are removing a big
big question from like
I think supposedly a topic that was supposed to be like taught this year
actually I can do I mean like I'm not very good with numbers in general but like
I could do math better than I do like I
back then like I was so bad at it but like I'm just giving myself a shot cause
it's like I'm just trying to work for my future at this point
but
yeah I mean like
even if with the topics being redacted and stuff like
I think the bell curve is going to be higher which kind of is going to suck so
mmhmm
yeah that's like my second time taking it so it like really sucks I mean like
I hope they understand the whole situation and also like maybe in future like
next year when they're like you know the intake for like tertiary education I hope there will be more lenient on it because it's like we
everybody is having a bad year this year I feel
but I mean
I understand what you feel lah like I also cannot like focus at home because like I have like four siblings and I have a naggy mother if I'm being honest
so it's like
you know I can never focus but then again like I'm better on my own
no matter the place like it doesn't have to be at home or anything
mm
only time will tell how we'll be like as marks you know in future
hopefully we're still friends by then
what were you doing yesterday
like
mm
mmhmm
yeah I mean like same I mean like I met
err rifky in the morning because like
and then I tried eating like that night itself I tried eating it again and it's still so much so like
rifky err I called rifky in the morning I said like hey do you want food
they were just doing their roundings ah but I didn't expect them to be like there that hour
but yeah I mean it was nothing
then after that like afterwards I just like stayed at home I didn't really do much
like
late at night lah
like it was so it's super nice it's like um
very innovative in my opinion
it's nice
mmhmm
I mean I've been there a few times and then like generally I feel like nothing there is
and yeah I mean like I recommend you to eat it but then it is a very big portion so that's one thing
and yeah I mean like I went to arab street like technically it was a sunday that I went there right
I kind of just don't really like going to these places in general in like
but it's okay lah I mean like I still like the atmosphere there lah it's just that it was like very hot and there were so many people so I got a bit like fussy
oh I ate with my family because it's like my it was my sister's birthday
then after that my sister like just requested that she wanted to eat there because like
ever since we tried there once like it became like our favorite place to eat
mmhmm
yeah that's what I feel also like
they from my experience right whenever like we go there like I think
um but yeah lah but I I think after COVID like they kind of cut down on it and stuff
but
ah you get it lah
you know ah there's this place I like to eat also it's called um indobowl
okay so like asides from indonesian food right they actually have this twist on like
ah Indomie then after that they have like for example like
side dishes and then they just infuse it together
it's a really nice concept honestly and it's really nice and the price is not so bad you know not as expensive as um
like um malayan council I mean like
a meal can go up to like eight to fifteen dollars for one it's not bad really
yeah basically then there's this ah I mean they have this platter thingy which I believe is
about forty dollars but it's meant to be shared but I tell you it's super nice and I don't know
I've always had good experiences with it I went there once and I kept going a few times it was just like not it's like the price point also not so bad you know
yeah actually same lah the other time when I was like you know because before COVID I had a job and then like
you know I could like treat myself to these kind of things like once a month at least
but now like ever since COVID I also have no money
and like
yeah so I've been trying to apply for jobs you know but I've been very access unsuccessful about it
what about you
the thing about that is they advertise it to make it sound really like attractive you know then okay to be fair like I tried to
uh applied for a lot also then like some a lot also never get back to me then some of them like
like is it worth like doing something like that I mean like as much as I'm desperate for a job also I'm just like is it still worth it
mm
they will say like oh we'll get back to you if we need you something like that in my opinion I feel like
because the waiting is very dreadful you know so I rather you just text me and say like I didn't get the job like
and like in the meantime at least I know
whether I should be applying for more jobs or I should like you know stop finding because like knowing I'll have the job or something
and yeah lah I mean like it's just
frustrating lah and then like you know these agents also sometimes they just
mmhmm
yeah I agree with that I mean like
I mean like I've worked a few jobs and stuff and then like you know so far I've been successful at getting it so like
this really hurts my heart that I've been so I've been rejected so many times
but and also like in a time like this you know like
everybody needs something but at the same time I understand why it's hard to hire people but at the same
time everybody's also broke so like
I don't know lah hopefully we'll get a job soon lah hopefully
actually ah I also under like over underestimated the fact that you know like COVID
just like outside people right and then after that there are people like singaporeans that got it then suddenly like
there was a spike and all that and it got mm like I was thinking to myself like okay this like whole ah
thing is not gonna die it's not going to
like go away any time soon
I like I also did a lot of online shopping I also did a lot like
Grab delivery and stuff because then I mean like Grab
I ordered Grab cause like
I was just so lazy to cook like it was so hard to be productive during circuit breaker
then all I did was just like
order food and order a lot of things online so I thought like maybe after circuit breaker I'll also get a job but
I didn't know it was still going to be hard
yeah
hmm
mm
mmhmm
then it's like they
like they prioritize so much about being like you know like
they prioritise so much about their free speech and then you know their rights as like you know doing this and that
but it's more of just like
you know you're like okay yeah you have your rights but at the same time like
look at the situation lah like you not using your mask and stuff like that like okay you want to die that's your problem but then don't
be hard on other people you know there are like people who are like you know auto immune you know which are more prone to the virus and stuff like that and
if it hits them it will be like ten times harder on them as well like you know average person
so yeah I mean
then like the other time also like I was watching the news
like cause like
err they were err the leading
doctor or scientist of
the whole like COVID situation in
um the right they were I think explaining to donald trump saying that
oh if you leave if you like you know stay out in the hot or the sun it will like you know
kill the bacteria of like the COVID faster
so like on surface you know like technically it can be passed through surfaces right but if it's a hot or if you sanitize it and stuff it will like die
like I don't know whether like how he read it or something but he was saying like
oh maybe uh we can look into like injecting ourselves with sanitizers with bleach and stuff like there were like you know
hoping to not get the uh virus then I'm like thinking to myself just like how are you
how is it possible that you even entered politics you know
like from what I heard right
like when he was making the speech
the doctor was just like staring at him like you know thinking like you know just like
why did I get myself into this into this
yeah
and then like it was really bad to the point that you know like mayors of different states
had to like
even tweet it out and say like you know
I can't believe I need to say this but please do not
drink detergent or like don't drink sanitizers or cleaning products
I don't know ah cause I feel like
the people like he's so I guess business forward
to the point that he was like more focused on
like the economy and stuff like
that I mean I get it lah like the economy is like important and stuff but then like
you can't have an economy if you don't have people right
so is like I think he was briefed and I watched this TikTok somewhere that he was briefed
about the whole COVID situation
um way like in like january like before he was
like before it like it it wouldn't really like stepped into
um the err the or like the just the western world in general
then like
he only took action like during may
you know then ah before that like I was watching like patriot act or something right then he was
there was this like whole like cause like the
it started spreading through like beef
industries and stuff like that because like
they didn't err they didn't let
the uh the workers like not
like you know social distance and stuff like that and then they were like
and then like
there's this like act I forgot like what
it's called but it's like
you
can mass produce stuff
in times of like crisis or war for example like when there's a war the act
then like the mm
president can uh enable this act so that you know they can mass produce like maybe like
metals and stuff like
war planes and stuff like that so I don't know why but it mass him
enabled that for the beef industry
and then like I don't know why he decided to do it for you know then he was saying like cause
um
most of the things are like you know like they are running out of food of something like that
something like that and plus like the cows
because of COVID like
they're all like
unattended because of the thingy but like the thing is like he put an act on that and not on like
for example like masks and like medical supplies because like
uh most medical supplies were from China and stuff and then they were like you know
there wasn't a shipment at that point of time but then in the have their own manufacturers but the thing is that
I don't know why it wasn't
acted on that and then for a moment there wasn't enough like
supplies for the medical team back in the
and then also like with the whole like drinking bleach thing like it's a common sense kan apparently common sense isn't not
who
I don't know dinosaur
oh okay that is so stupid
what's his name
yeah lah I mean like you put in effort also right so it's like then like
for them like to not
but yeah I mean like how's your time I mean like how how long have you been on OkCupid
yeah I mean I used to be on OkCupid also and then I received like the
funniest things I also I don't feel like I'm so picky also lah but then like yeah those like
yo and boring one like okay lah maybe I close one eye if you are good looking but like
you I don't know I mean like you want to like capture somebody's attention lah like
okay err there was ah
this person said
uh what did the okay cause like
um what did err what did the drummer name his daughters
yeah
so like you know my name is anna right so it's like
uh the answer is anna one anna two
anna one two three four
mm
hmm
yeah I mean like I I mean like I don't know how he
like got it maybe like it's a typical joke but then like it only works for people with the name anna I mean like how often do you know
of a girl named anna right
then also like I don't know that got me started talking
to him you know he was like really interesting and stuff but like I think it didn't really move on from there because like you know dating apps
you don't really move on that far
literally I was on all like I was on Tinder Bumble OkCupid because I was so bored during circuit breaker
oh okay so Bumble right
basically right for example like
okay as like
like for example if I uh if a guy like I swipe right to either like guys or girls
and for example like
if it's a guy the guy cannot text first
if you are the first one to swipe then like you haven't like
matched yet right then you don't have to start the conversation but if you are the one who swipes later and
you get the match right you have to be the one who starts a conversation and there's a time limit for you
like for example like there's
uh I mean err for you to text then the second you text
the person has twenty four hours to respond then from then there's just no timer
it's a very interesting concept actually
create a like you know an intro or like you know they are the ones that have like
start a conversation but this time it's like the
it's a reverse role so it forces you to want to text people
which is interesting lah but honestly I find like Bumble has like more good looking guys
I feel like not the typical like you know
I don't know cause like not a lot of people use Bumble compared to OkCupid and Tinder
yeah lah like
dah
dah dah like COVID eh so I don't know how many foreigners are still left in singapore
yeah I tried K Fry but okay honestly
maybe I had my expectations too high or something or maybe
I have like an like an idea of how it tastes in my head
it was a bit disappointing eh
but maybe I mean like maybe you'll enjoy maybe I'll enjoy it but maybe I just wouldn't put
like it's just not as nice as I thought it would be
but ah there's this thing called like a rice ball or something they mix it with like
sushi and like eh not sushi sorry um
like rice seaweed and like different stuff that one was nice but then like
would I go there for the chicken again I'm not sure
but like
the vibes is nice if I'm being honest and it's
okay lah for malaysia standard it's slightly pricey
mmhmm
hmm
no
you caught me at salted egg
I want to try the Din Tai Fung
um
and just like you know go shopping and stuff
so bad you know I want to see family enjoy the cheap food
then sometimes I like to like you know just make a little trip to like at night
and then like you know just
have fun lah you know cause like
I have friends now who
have motorcycles
I sneak out I just like take my passport and I just go but like
it's fun it's fun
yeah I love pepper lunch okay I accidentally tried it in singapore before cause like
yeah but didn't did like the last time I think the last time I went to didn't like we see each other by accident
it was like at or something right
mm
yeah it was so funny I remember I waved at you and then my family all just like turned around just like
oo who is that why do you have friends I'm like no
I mean it was fun uh I mean like err I think at the point of time I was at
a wedding near right but then like
we just didn't have the social battery to like you know like
just have like uh
to communicate with like our other uh relatives cause this is like a bit of like extended family it's like my dad's
but yeah cool lah then after Starbucks we like went to the Apple store
like then my uh my cousin bought like a macbook there which is like cheaper you know apparently
yeah then after that like just nice lah like he just bought everything there cause he was like starting school also
hmm
mmhmm
yeah I think I get you I mean okay honestly I'm not like the biggest fan of like
my family members you know I really miss it too
yeah no my aunt's um cousin
like from her other side then like we
err an indian muslim guy and the food was so good like
and yeah I kind of miss it like you know like it's also like free food right
I love it
ah
yeah yeah yeah for me it's like
I don't know
yes oh my god like
I mean it's it's stated in the name already you know it has to be there
okay but I remember some um the other time like I had an aunt
okay lah I mean like for mm for me for for you like you want to do anything like
very big family then like I always need to finish like my visiting and stuff like that
there's such thing
like your focuses are wrong seh but
you know people want to like you know
wedding would really spoil that I don't know how that works
mm
that's what I thought also like at first cause like
I think about it eh it's like
you know but at the end of the day like I mean like
have a reception afterwards then like have a bigger honeymoon right it's always better
mm
hmm
hmm
for me like
cause like I come my parents uh my grandparents are originally like from like malacca
I don't know for for me I guess a tradition
like the tradition I would want to omit out is just it being very big and with people I don't know
or like but at the end of the day it's just like I'm I mean like it's
to make it like stand out okay lah maybe I'm a bit narcissistic also I just want it to be like that wedding that people will never forget you know and I want ice cream
hmm
I'm just not a fan of that maybe at most like you know
see see at least got like err got aircond then you know
yeah I don't know I'm like everytime I go like weddings or something I'm always like in my head like
planning my own wedding like okay how is this going to pan out and stuff
oo ee
is it the one with eddie murphy
is it
mm
it's okay man like I've been thinking about my like future since I was like
since I was like you know really young too like eleven you know like I have a name from my
yeah I mean I have err I have names for like maybe my future children then like uh um
my first child I plan it to I plan for it to be like luna malika
I haven't thought of like a guy's name but pretty sure I like the name maliki
and I don't know I like the name like
ayla like A Y L A you know because I feel like
ah it's such a nice name you know it's like a unique but like not so hard to pronounce name
I feel especially with the fact that you know you you're just at home alone and then you don't really think much
it happens you know like for me is like I already picture what kind of house I want to have and stuff like where I want it to be located and stuff
like you know like in a singaporean like you know setting lah obviously like
but as much as I want to have like a
five storey bungalow something like
I'm pretty sure it's possible here but also like I I need to hustle way too much I mean way too hard to get there
mmhmm
sometimes I think about it also like
isn't it like for me like I think if it's like better for me to just my migrate because it's like
you know having everything but then I think again like all my family is here
then after with the whole COVID situation like so many like governments just like you know all the problems just came up
as much as I feel like it's a bad thing that but it's so ah it's also like a good thing that I feel like you know like the problems are being addressed but yeah mean like
for now at least I feel like
mm I'll just stay here
for the time being if not then
I'm oh I mean I'll just pack up and leave
yeah I mean um
I mean I don't understand ah for me is like I've always wanted to go overseas also and study but like
and
like you know it's just very competitive like in within the asian culture
go europe or something you know with like a whole different language like I want to learn a new language and stuff but then I thought about it lah like
cause I did early childhood before and then like
to be in the environment with like your culture and stuff will like
it's better lah cause like the child will grow up like you know understanding it better so like for me if I'm like let's just say I move to europe
my it's going to be hard for my child to learn like
basically like three languages like for example like if I don't speak the language
like of that european country let's just say it's Spain right then like my child have to learn to like
learn malay learn it's like english and also like
spanish and also like learn the culture there then they won't have like any ties to like
singapore cause like you know they never grew up in singapore which is like a bit sad lah cause it's like you know it is my culture and then I want to bring it down also so
I guess like
staying in singapore is always like the best option and plus like you know being a singaporeans there's always like benefits
with like the whole like healthcare and stuff like you know
like housing healthcare
as much as it's expensive it's still like beneficial
mmhmm
yeah oh my same lah cause like I my my mum's malay is like super good like apparently she got like A one or something back in
secondary school and then she became a malay teacher once and then she was saying ah like
oh my god like none of my children can speak malay and she was like especially you you know
and then like my mum was saying lah like
um ah my mum was saying saying like ah like
in future she wants to take care of my children and for the main purpose is because
for sure cannot help them with their malay
mmhmm
mm
oh
would not be able to do as well
because it's like
I'm not very good at it but it's like you know I like the whole
idea that we still do it then like it kind of just like it surprised me that a lot of my friends like don't
like you know they don't know how to do it
and then like sometimes also like sometimes they tell me like you know they don't even celebrate like the first day or like they don't celebrate at all then I'm like
even though like growing up like you know
the fact that I know that there are malay people in this day and age like who don't do it just makes me so sad

uh um
um
uh
um
err ya then err
ah ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
oh yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get um
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad err cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it um ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
uh any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but um
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back uh just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it um even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but um maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me err excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not um just buy err knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya err just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that um which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work um then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes ah okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then uh you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say err when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss johor so much our old house ya but now it's um make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it ah abu
oh it's a terrace oh okay
yup because ah it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and err I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun lah ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase abu
sticky sambal I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's uh it's whatever happens um
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
um because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper what I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger ramly burger ramly that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of err cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup err sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go johor and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that abu
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
mm I think so
um ah we went to cycling um
ah we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge err you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
ah and we tried um tried their ah that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it uh you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say abu like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
um yes because I was um for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
um I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
oh wait I can't um
oh actually I think I didn't went um
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or uh high elements in um school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay um my camp was at the pulau ubin there ya
um I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the uh I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore um ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to um rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
um you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
um I remember um
I can't um in secondary school we did a lot of things
um like uh like camps mostly camps
err give I remember um chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days uh and then what else oh err it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time uh in our secondary school um we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
um cause we had we change our principal I um our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they uh do uh about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
um ya
and all of them all of these charities err will be donated to the uh respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs lah for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that uh you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy err to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games ah and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you err I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
uh plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
mm ya and we have a lot of programmes lah actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme um like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed um how the way how they speak
we and their english ah the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that um I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup err from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them lah ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type lah actually um but ah for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you err like example for me uh I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
err
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like um ya um
it's like school also but no ah I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
um
sports there's a lot ah actually ya and yup oh to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves lah like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
um doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my err using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school uh we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs lah like you have to make err you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically err and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking um
because I I cause why I choose that course is um I I I want to learn how to uh bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
um pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun lah to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
oh um okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot um okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made um I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great um
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made err the pizza it um and we also make cakes um black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could err redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if ah even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like uh you have to cut it into threes uh three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and err after err the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling err at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
oh okay I remember um we didn't make okay err I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is pate choux in french and then you know uh we had to do eclaire choux so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like uh cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my err my class advisor though
um my sir showed us uh a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who uh they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed lah like they have really nice talents to um which I can also learn from them
ya
oh my lecturer name my err we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really err sir jeremy is a very nice uh teacher he
the uh he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our uh parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him uh he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who err
which teacher doesn't want to see their children uh their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like err like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
um
do you mean during COVID nineteen
um I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
um this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows err appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does uh when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause uh because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example lah like um
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross lah
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know err in restaurants last time was like uh you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the um the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like um um
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
um I know wearing a mask it will it will helps um to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face lah example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to um get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen uh to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like um it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
um
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like oh ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and oh and I was oh I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya mm but it's hard to breathe sometimes and ah ya
mm I don't know lah like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya

page right just search for naruto then search for the synopsis part and then you see you scroll down the moment you see the words filler right
then you just skip ah you will know which
the owner like get surgery on this its actually because
one of the ways to make it look nicer is I have to go for the surgery lah ya basically like cut a piece of the skin off and then stitch it together and make it like but someone do that but just double surgery on both
make it look like right
serious ah

if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be

and then
we don't need to worry about
you know
so if you don't have to work
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
I think
we will just
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm

um I only risk
failures lor
oh I risk time

because I'm really so old you know like twenty four
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically lah
so macam like
like ugh

tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like oh ah

just the
just how society
look at us

like their requirement to like oh for women to be considered
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong

society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish

mmhmm
mm
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did

so far no matter even if I had bad choices right I feel like I am generally pretty satisfied with whatever I choose lah
like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story lah
is a is a lesson to learn
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
because like that okay I think my third wish I would
ah
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
I also didn't know like it was one of my choices lah for me to to

I mean when you're going to go to work also they also just throw you some
work for you to do what they won't even explain to you

woohoo
let's go hello
mmhmm
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
mmhmm
oo
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya um I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
a bit of both
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
how do I do
oo
ya
that's a good superpower
oo
saves time
ya
wow
I've never thought of that
unusual
oo
then I think
uh first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
ten years ago oo
right
wow
wow ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
mmhmm
ya
I think that is peer pressure
kan
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
oo
oh you call it monitor in your school
class chair
mmhmm
mmhmm
they have different ya
mmhmm
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I oh ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it um have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two uh different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic um just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student um leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had um the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
and we are good with uh literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
mmhmm
of course
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
like a stable right
ya
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat um sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
ya
mm
in school
oo
yes
something else
wow
the best
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
chicken wrap
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
ya
kan
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
oo ya
ya
fragrant
oo
ya
the ramen the japanese ramen that's my number one
ah that's good ramen there's the
end stall that's why
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also kimchi ramen
the beef
ramen
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
I mean
as long as halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
oo
we're sticking to that oh my god ya
ya
sensitive
ya
perspectives
mmhmm
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
um bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
was number one for me
I did all the that are good sports to I have multiple
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
oo don't get me started on secondary school but was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
ah
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is
um which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
uh and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same what like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
a side of rugby during did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies uh I remember one time
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like um she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
um
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like huh what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
council you're the thing you're popular but
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
ya
come back to school the next day and see the same people and
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
wow
orh
wow
one wish
I would say
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
I will go through it you know
ya
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
mm
mmhmm
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
I've been talking
oh
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
oo
ya
mmhmm
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right oo
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but oo
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay ah I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
uh plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
um you don't have any commitment to something
mm
mm
wow
I've been there before
ya should I say the one I've been there before or should I create something
again
cause bali eh bali balling okay
it's a mini paradise
if you want like a bigger paradise people would say it's maldives
and stuff like that but I actually wanted to go dubai
I am an expensive girl
no I want to go dubai for sure cause my number one bucket list since like young
is to go dubai and go skydiving in the palm jumeirah
ya
ya
yes
that's why I want to go there
like scared
level seven is already like now I live in level seven
it's already too high for me I used to live at level two
all the way but this one is level seven
oo
you know what I've known you for quite awhile thirteen is too much for me
the floor kan it's not like the straight
so your house it's already scary for me I don't know about skydiving but I wanna try
you're being no you're going with me
yes
screw secondary school
screw bullies
a'ah
ya
mmhmm
ya
okay
ya let's go
for free
it's free
but what
ya that's all I think I will go
imagine being a traveller
like working as a traveller
how risky not how cool how risky
it's up to the producer tau
that's risky
okay
mmhmm
in specific
mmhmm
generally
drama
it's you I
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
I like romance
oh you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
ya
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty kan
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
mm
that's the thing I don't like to watch
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
mm
but something that really shook you up
oh ya
ya
ya
mmhmm
ya
money
ya
mmhmm
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
you know what I mean
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
apocalypse
how
ah
ya
infected
um
wow
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but um how would we end humankind
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
but like how long could that last
and how long could this um virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly wow
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
oh ya ya
oo fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
mmhmm
ya
and find ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's not mandatory
ya although even uh during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
um whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of um like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
is
hmm
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where um
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through
you know
mmhmm
for the rest of my life
wow
um
okay
shoot
meat
steak wow
everything
ya
boil
oo oh ya
ya
I think
a'ah eh
okay
karma
ya
what goes around comes around
we always tend to think the best of yourself
oh
oh karma
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think ya
yours
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
oh you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
wow
mmhmm
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
mmhmm
oo
oh we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
of course
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
what's the point
what's the point ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting jer
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
wow
ya
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
yes
really hard but ya
like it's just cause I'm small
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like um the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious lah
mm
mm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
wow
wow
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
ya of course
mm
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
mmhmm
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
mmhmm
ya
like a space is what you need
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence

okay I start
year two marine engineering
how is it going
so for me and
how about you
okay
and I'm doing quite okay in it lah
mm
doing okay
oh
is like to win lah is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself lah
so actually our poly life quite stale
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert ah
studying
in secondary school especially in my
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
that's when N levels I did well
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong ah
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
oh
oh
oh
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head lah I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
ya
ya
they love it too much lah they think you can they can
you can hold on to you ah
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
burger king
mm
I basically after N levels
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
I work there and it was a good experience lah it was a good two months
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
don't have the same uh mentality as us
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
so it's a tough time ah for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
ya
after staff day nope
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's what
the group mah
mm
okay that was that was fast
like photographer ah
oh
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
how to say eh
my opinion ah
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
you apply yourself
they would expect you to know how to do and all
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
because it's the top few ah from what I know lah from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
so I just follow the flow
then ya lah I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
mm
to make it as your career
mm
correct agree
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore lah
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan ah
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down lah
ya
yup but honestly
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
that's how much I love bio last time
so is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
annoying
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
mm
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun lah I mean
I I watch a lot of ah boys to men ah so I find the navy part the best ah
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
got highly likely lah
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I pass my
then after that I hope I can go to ah
special operations command
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and uh
ah firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life hor
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first leh
will definitely be will definitely glow up lah after
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
I don't think got chance ah
intelligence
talk eh
four hours
quick maths ah
okay
it was okay
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma lah there's normally
consider
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
okay
it's kinda cool though
mm
primary school
mm
is like our one of our longest ah
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be ah
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
wrestling
so I really look up to them ah
so I like their character ah
ya that was that was fun days ah
do you do parkour in school it's like normal lah primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak ah
yes
mm
mm
okay
oh
so you have been leading all the way lah you have been leading the lines lah
discipline
mm
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
tekong the left side is striker
oh
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
they were national team player ah after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
junyuan tampines located around tampines kan
junyuan
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus lah
pressure lah
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
you never go this far lah
woo amazing story
I don't really have much luck lah
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
you will always be blamed
to our highest position that we ever got
in gan eng seng secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us err err the
the the drop dead centre lah
then when I go so basically no luck lah I go delta league also I play under my school name
uh and that one second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
for a prize
then when I goes poly
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me lah it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
like
go down ah
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
um this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
they they appointed me as captain and
and I look at how rich our history
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
ya so I guess
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
you
you will not succeed
you know
at least something know
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey lah how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
because to see change you also have to change
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as
we must be up there
you know
but ya lah it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further lah
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life
mm love life
okay
oh
like candy sia nothing serious
orh
good one good one right right
went out more often then
then who who had the courage
to go first
to ask
oh you ask
and she's a nice woman
how do you cope with it okay
I think it's now close to an hour I purposely ask you that question so that we can end it on a high
more even though I know you already
but ya we we we open up more

izzah is which one
to dabao for us is it

mmhmm
but I don't think she can like she can realise that uh because she's in too deep already
I know they are strict ah but I don't know what
just kidding
mm
ya
irfan was like an outlier lah he's
his situation is I've never heard of
he like
ya
can safirah fall in love with like some normal guy
kan
a'ah
ya
ya
we would put it in like one basket
great grandmother
sec two or sec three
she was she was the seekers she used to take care of my theatres all the time when she was
if like a good education

eh amshar I'm doing good lah how how about you
you mean great and just
what's up ah with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life ah
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preoccupied with things that we need to do lah like like for example
weekend is the only time I got time lah to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of err measures that have been imposed ah that we need to
you eh what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
one hundred is it
hundred people ah now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
oh so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures lah
then I got wedding I need to go to lah next week then is
err from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
people per like per time ah
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
then there's no like what intermingling lah between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts lah
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this ah is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially lah it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful lah
ya
oh no serious serious like my uncle's
err wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay ah
eh then that time your I remember you posted something about err
ya that one I'm not
ya
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like err a bit of a
contention here right because uh
some people say that err
or poly or something ya ya
something like that lah from that's what I understand lah but I haven't really read into it yet lah so
okay
oh
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
err will also affect judging from err taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well lah
ya
speak
ah
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us lah especially
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good lah ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly ah do you any see do you see any purpose in doing now or not ah
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life the life lessons that you learn are social lah
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas lah
can or not
ya
like your own circle lah ya I I agree with you about that lah I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
people outside my own social circle and
err I got to make new friends ah which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
err these two years err
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya lah I mean we all have our different opinions about lah but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it lah while it lasts ya
mmhmm
go to or choose to go or not to go
I'd say I think I would choose to not go lah because I feel
like err
I can err
well when I'm outside lah as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
eh I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents lah now is like the best time for me to after right
um you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in cause I can't really
do anything else lah ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay ah now looking back err
it's not such a bad deal lah
mm
really meh you think it will really
help us meh like cake
oh okay fair enough
yes
mm
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I uh I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go err amshar what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say uh you're going out with your family
I think those kind of places really got the vibes ah ya
you really just feel like uh you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones lah
ya and especially when you eat home cooked food
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience lah then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
err free kan everyone got uh no plans so we all just go err at least have a meal lah together
and most of the time err my mum will cook and then err
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat ah
you worst comes to worst is err
how you call that we just order in food lah if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays kan
so
even though err we then we will go out like
ya so
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore lah you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones lah
ya
I think for me I like to
so betweeen spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me lah
ya because friends are what uh
has made me like uh what I am today for the
how could I say ah for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends lah
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely err
uh enjoy spending time with them lah ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
so the
so it's all about err that
what you call that
balance lah between err spending time with
err your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your money how do you spend your money on amshar
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father lah right they talk about
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation lah having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together lah like they say it's err every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that uh helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad lah ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january mah
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours lah
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
what
ya cause err I don't know people had extra then they just give me ah
so the five of us just went in together then
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday lah ya
and one of the worst workout days
ah first thing I went back to bunk ah I just
like wah what am I doing
far away from my family in in awhile lah doing something that
I didn't uh explicitly choose to do lah
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause uh we didn't get to at
marina bay you know that whole err walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that lah but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
friends lah and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good lah then we'd be even closer ya
ah the most recent batch they did twenty four
err oh changi food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that um
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all lah ah you finished
ya that nine weeks of then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself lah
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training ah
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone lah bro
oh ya ya that's true
mm
okay
okay
mm
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
I spend my money on lah so you know the money that I get I just
it's already like this much
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier what I mean taking is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late ah ya so
what
oh the the amount of money I spend on
transport err food
and then after that err miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
err
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets err what you call that you don't really think about it lah
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want lah
so that's when you really need to be more
mm
mm
honestly correct correct um ah
mmhmm
ya lah
slightly more lah ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
you're really getting um
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes ah I understand
like what you said lah like when I first got it also I was like wah I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
err I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize err actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them lah
come on especially right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now lah
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money lah
ya
mmhmm
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand lah maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
err a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to err trying spending their money lah feeling that
I mean trying to err not to say like enjoy now lah
but err saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future lah ya so that we can always err
like help our family out lah or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others lah
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable lah
ya
mmhmm
four lah four
ya okay
mm ya
ya lah ah ya I understand where you come from lah
ah ya
mm
I think for for our generation it is like
ah no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors lah
since they're all what you call that ah
cause you know that that err we have that break routine um
when once you then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money lah for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
err fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
err throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job lah
ya and I guess the purpose of
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have err financial independence ah
and um do what you want with it lah
mmhmm
uh huh yes
ya
ya
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about um investing but
uh what uh I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship lah that's something I would like to work towards to lah
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say ah they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands ah
ya and really just err be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out whoa
maybe I might even consider signing on lah
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's uh realistic it's realistic it's worth especially um
err you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
ya it's acceptable lah ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain what
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education ah or in my case I guess uni lah so
by doing that really
um provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we ah
I think was about being like um financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
err responsible in that particular aspect of their live lah
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it lah because everyone is um
how to say it's not about
mm not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to err
take your ah carry your own weight ya and really err feel the sense of um
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from lah over these past few years lah
ya definitely lah
can we talk about food now amshar please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about and all
ya eh so amshar ah what's your favourite food
huh
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
oh oh scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no ah like it's something that helps me
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being um
ya for the taste of it lah and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any err preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food lah
comfort food
hajjah maimunah bro hajjah maimunah expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
then I remember bought um
eight dollars for one head
wah that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it lah ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
a'ah
okay lah okay so we're talking wait ah so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards ban mian
ban mian
soup is like really something that wah I feel like ah tom yum also but tom yum is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat tom yum right the maggi one it just hits different lah I think
would definitely be instant noodles
then it's also quite easy to make lah then like that I also don't have to what
err wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
err for sustenance per se but it's all about um
looking out for others also
no then I guess that's what can really bring people together also lah
ya
okay lah
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth ah
oh swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
oh ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
wah I think now is like really the best lah
wah is that wah then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said lah I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
oh bulking season bro
ya
ya
oh ya
I think eh two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
ya it's like I went up by about fifteen or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels lah and food was something that gave me comfort lah
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
so right
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
feeling lah ah ya lah so
that that that the break time right was really very precious lah
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance ah but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying err the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring lah
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
mmhmm
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
mm
mm
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
um what you call that there's very remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also lah
ya so it's like
ah they had they had the only they for the roti prata which is like not even allowed
oh so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking eh bro what's this ah what's this then after that
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this err
it was like wah really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories ah
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing lah because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
ya I mean if you're awake lah
that's a
prerequisite
uh
eh but speaking of food right do you cook
ya lah
ah yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like uh you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
ya wah that was a absolute err logistic nightmare
this one can make forty then come out wah twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
um wet
then I have to oh err ask my mum eh what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay alamak just add more flour lah that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
err usable lah ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like eh actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
err know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya lah ya lah
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control what
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like eh why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away lah
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun lah I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then err slowly drop off one by one
and you know uh
ya I dodged his mum so I I stay in the
that trip was just for you bro
that's quite nice also lah ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
cause it was the COVID thing
no no uh
ya
and you had your interview
ya lah
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the then you're like
err err ya
is not bad not bad
ha wah the things I do huh for my friends
uh
no lah
ya
mmhmm
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it lah
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
so I might as well just give it away lah then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still err like a blur for me because
the thing is um how to say this ah that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
but then err she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help lah
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time ah you can't help but
notice that eh you're kind of holding up the queue lah so
I should probably make you go a bit faster lah
but then I um feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how ah
ya
yes eh definitely
mmhmm
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
mm
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help lah
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it lah but at the same time that's when you guys come in lah when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience um
you know that um
you have to be sensitive lah be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone lah especially elderly person
ya oh my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat eh helping your friends oh talk about friends right then you
ah then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
oh my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
sedap then if it was not halal
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
mmhmm
hmm
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like err more to being uh okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like eh you're
how how do I say this mm like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing lah huh
cause like let's just say eh err
let's go eat ah din tai fung you know obviously that's a no go for me
um make us feel bad so they will just err go to somewhere we can eat lah
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's err slightly limited lah
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
um let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
um
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go uh there's a lot of cheap ramen stalls
ya lah let's just say ramen stalls but they're not halal
cheaper ramen stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then wah the obviously the receipt be quite expensive lah
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
I don't want to make them feel paiseh also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they I mean they say don't mind lah but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit somewhere there also lah but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk lah because at the end of the day like eh actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not what you call that uh but I've no no what's that err
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one ah
ya eh that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know ah there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
take to the edit ah there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places lah
ah like okay I meant bugis paya lebar or bugis bro
so many halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but I tell you I can't eat prata every single day bro
prata is not I can't live on prata bro ya
mm uh mm
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
they've err they're slightly no update okay it's very obvious
obvious and uh they're slightly cringey
err what you call that national err health promotion board ah
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay jamaahs right
err coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like oh actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it lah and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same lah
like cause it's still the same dish mah
ya and
like what I said it is definitely not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya huh so
hmm
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of err will always comprise of
that lah of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but uh you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's err older right it's definitely something very difficult to
err change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages lah
ya
ah yes yes yes
ah bro then when the teh O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
eh ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
ya ah that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food lah
so the
but we only go there every week lah
that's when we are all are free mah cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend lah or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
err this kind because like I mean uh for
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool lah that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
mmhmm
ya lah
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya lah
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family lah because
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to lah quite close lah
she prepare less lah
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to err weekends is definitely bubble tea ah
I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate eh
ah
oh so oh you're more of that old school bubble tea lah so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
and then got err sweet
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
huh
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you wah you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars lah at least
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends lah something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely ah my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract lah you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya lah ya lah definitely lah I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before starts
is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else lah
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference ah
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you

eh long time no see bro how are you bro
oh you working as a steward is it I heard last time when I saw you at facebook
wow six months eh
so uh what's your favourite country
serious ah
saudi arabia
mm
and then they have a lot of uh weapons uh
a lot of things ah so I don't really trust
spain
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get kan cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors ah
wow so they really suffer eh so all industry are affected by this eh
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
but then I decided that you know uh I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since ah
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still uh no choice ah what to do kan
ya so these things are are the same ah so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't ah allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swabbers
but as a clinic assistant ah I can tell you it's actually pretty safe ah cause you're fully protected you're under the the uniform
mm
people who try to work as grab food deliveries eh
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity eh
I think ah then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity ah I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well lah I would say
mm
bro that one I think really depends on on the family that you're living with ah if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
then both of you are working then should be okay ah
you know
ah have a lot of kids for our parents you know
mm
mm
ya that's true though
um actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry ah if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think err the new families are more worried to even have children
they will definitely get it back
despite the circumstance that we are in
bro mine I think around six hundred plus ah cause I have a siblings in the house kan
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult lah for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way ah I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine ah but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle ah if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise ah
exactly
I think ah a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but err you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members ah so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then err you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health ah so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves lah cause they cannot take it already what
and then so this why all these things ah need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do ah
these things this ah period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up ah
we
suffer bro
mm
mm true ah true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health ah legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced ah ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do ah with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being ah no choice bro this is the hard time ah then
I really hope that this thing will go away ah seriously
ya of course bro
mm
mm true true I agree ah
but ah I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
um with this situation going on
err people who's been living
so I think is very difficult for those who are
ah who are well-off ah as compared to those who who who has been living err
but this is their difficult times
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims kan what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
oh
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states eh the ah ya uh the whole
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
I'm not I'm not
ya it it's so sad and so sick ah to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing ah I think it's it's too much ah to be honest
but like like like what I've said ah I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business ah sector that's why uh most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them ah
it's ironic ah we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change ah to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know err what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
mm
oh that that's
that's another actually interesting uh news ah
the this black people they black people kan you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those ah big uh big leaders last time err like muhammad ali the famous boxer and then
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know ah I don't understand what
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour kan why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased lah but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself ah but
it's just unfair ah cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid ah
mm
perform ah
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted lah in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of ah in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter tau so it's really sad ah
ya
err
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter ah
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges ah eh in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different ah
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays ah
but um
ya when you look at these malaysians eh they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays kan they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
or
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but uh
but then ya lah you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed ah in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things ah which doesn't really ah help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
ya mm
eh I I actually agree seh cause ah when I when I watch ah the parliaments in malaysia eh
actually quite jialat eh like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's err a person in-charge kan to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control ah to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
ya speaking of which err I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic uh
basic err
ah basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries kan cause you are representing you're representing your country what
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh ah which to me I find it very very ah interesting cause how can someone
err who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think uh it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia eh you can get away with all these things
um
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
mm
ah that's true eh I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes lah eh but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know eh I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense ah but speaking of I mean in regards to your question ah kan
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything kan so
it's not that err
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice ah and then probably err you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays ah
so ah I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes ah I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia ah cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money ah
mm
um how you upgrade yourself lah as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things ah doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education ah or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
err ya it's tough ah but I think overall still again it's all about balance ah if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily ah which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
serious ah
I I think it's uh I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
mm ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really ah
I mean I I I understand that some people some um
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent ah the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner ah
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work ah you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow ah
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have uh have with your child ah
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
for some other other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there lah I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad lah but we have no choice lah we are living in a country where
money is our priority ah over love ah
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time ah you have to make sacrifices ah
we have to make do with what we can ah no choice
so really ah it's really about upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide ah
uh both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
it's all priorities ah eh
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro
bye

ya
ya but then I don't want to go through the abuse

because he's such a versatile actor but if it was a young actor maybe I want to be number five
so handsome
oh I'm a sixteen year old boy

like dance rap but then if I were to wake up as me in their body I think cannot
that's so
a'ah
wow
huh work
at all
not go work but um ah
I don't know leh I feel like we will like
go back to how we were
ya we would have to like make our own food you know farm or whatever right it's still kind of like work
but maybe it means
oh like a depression ah
wah man I don't know man
ya I think will be like if you don't need money to survive right do you have other means
it's like a dystopian game
if it were me I will just sleep
but if you don't have to go to work
so be anything lah whatever people need lah
ah you give me food and I'll give you a hug how about that
okay what is it must listen first if kiss can kiss on the cheek
but please I hungry if not I just kill you lah
but that's an interesting question though I can't imagine ah cause it's too far far fetched already
but you realise or not like apocalypse themed movies like singapore don't do that imagine in singapore context we do that I don't know how it's going to be
ah that's true lah
ya
but apocalypse in singapore I don't know sial
how is it going to be
of course not lah it's like gradual
ya
ya ya ya
but I feel like if ever lah got apocalypse in singapore I think all the races will finally get together and will not think about actually being coloured
ya like
come on sis
extinct
ya ya ya ya
what's the question again
I think
I mean based on what I see in the news and all that I think err global warming
would ya either we drown or we will run out of food like there's no more resources left that's how ya we become barren lah
which is like most likely but imagination wise I don't know leh
oh because of the pandemic now
ya ya ya ya
that's my legs
spread ah
oh
ya
ya we already cut oh wow
no
bridge
um break down
wow how convenient sia
ah
swordfish
ya
wow
so like trump
ah
we'll be the last to die
our import export don't have already how
lose oh okay obvious at each country or ya because it's like humans were extinct rhino hope right ya lah so no choice lah actually depressing
lose weight
ya
yay
I feel like we'll extinct it will be because of a flu like we will sneeze too much until we get dehydrated and die
hopefully not lah eh now already COVID it's so scary
err work ah
eh
but something you already hate right like something
oo everyday activity
that is torture yes
that's torture that's too much
is it
oo that's like work seh babe
oh this is a game
ya lah
I think eating for eight hours is a torture also that's like why would you do that but
exercise normally already torture
exhaustion
sial lah chores for eight hours
ya ya ya
therapeutic
okay then maybe not
I want to say sleeping but then
I cannot torture myself lor
so many things
why I rather die

hello
I know I want to be able to make someone have diarrhoea
if I don't like the person it's okay no need to say anything just like diarrhoea
ya they won't they won't think it's me also
ya and then you can it can happen anytime you want
see the ghosts because I'm like
claus like can make them do much for me
ya lah but I'm also depressed so I feel like I can lah
that's true lah hi
I'll just make I'll just make them a K-pop group ah then okay go around and stray kids
ya I think that's the side effect of his power ah
ya I think ghosts more than people
but then why you say that you want to see ghosts is it
ya but your super power
ya
most of them are quite bullshit lah but the one the real ones like
oh
ya ya my friend like that also but the fake ones I like because
they quite consistent but
is like why why must you do this all the time like
it's a guy ah
kan like I find it very hard to believe ah

ya that's true oh my god but
okay good luck for your interview
okay yay

hello hello eh hi
what's good
got this like you know very tired stay at home
I'm quickly
how about you
theme park that one got the universal studios singapore
mm
women who who who
oh
ya actually that one sia the
uh what work uh work from home and like all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard lah because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
then you can
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like what or they use Zoom ah
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward ah because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say eh teacher how to do this one
you know
oh god but then now that at home right
during class all I keep watching Tik Tok ah then
ya got the that one the
when dissolved then thomas super previously
oh my god you know but then kan
like been able to like cycle even more
then that time I go cycle for like
almost six hours eh brother I go to bukit timah Zoom Zoom
ya
because like
um
mm what what what kind of activities is inside your morning routine
right
this
so
legit ah
it's like
so I just I just put aside ah then I let my mum eat
ya
no but like
I like
um but like
there's two ways that's the way tick
the
oh my god just now I saw this one Tik Tok
what about you what kind of super power would you want
oh my god but actually I would I would want to be invisible also
ya I can go inside the toilet
no no like when you go inside toilet then when you pooping like that no one can see your legs so you don't scared
like it's a it's a very stupid question to ask
ya I think so I don't know I never see who it is
I just hear the voice
um
annoying but then actually right flying would also be good superpower nowadays
because breakdown then got jam
you can just fly to your destination
no but the thing is you got
your superpower is flying not super strength you cannot carry anyone
oh
you know
true true
you can fly but you cannot carry anyone with you
ya people see superman fly also but they don't care what
you know like there was spiderman one then toby maguire
then he was sending the pizza
then he wanted to send the pizza in like five minute or not he get fired
then after that like he he go behind the ally the change to the spiderman outfit
then after that he like fly out from the ally lah then after that like with the pizza in his hand but he very used to prepare costume
then after that people be like
the spiderman stole the guy pizza
like they they they never they never think that the
he's not the that person is spiderman
I think he just need a secret identity that's why just like that costume
yes
cannot I don't think you don't need a costume can just wear
a like fit that is like fitting to the flyer just wear like a
then people will like
ya
ya
ya
nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
oh my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much ah six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three
ya but then like when I play when I buy only after that I never play you know
I never played the Diablo three I think it became like what I buy I buy for
eighty five dollars then after that I never even like
I never even play that much like I only played it like maximum like fifteen times
like fifteen minutes fifteen
then actually I spent almost one hundred dollars on like Animal Crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad lah but then
damn you should play it
oh my god you just now just saw you say miss bae right like miss bae from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school sia I haven't been to like visit secondary school
why you don't want
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the one I was I was the one I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first one
okay ah I might be the worst ah but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no lah he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister irman
that teacher
then after that like uh I because he got too many students then after that everytime I ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his his uh attitude ah he's like he would prefer to like uh uh give his attention to those who are better you know
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like uh
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
um
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
uh what ah it became like
I just did a photoshop lah of people like climbing onto the that was very old
oh
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene lah so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya eh I remember you were doing also ah but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
oh my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the
it's very hard to use your focus on your and your studies at the same time
ya
uh
trail
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic kan
ya
tired
even in english also I can say like tired lah
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me ah in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
it's
ya
but
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army ah even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because sui sui in engineering
mm got chemical engineering
you know
ah
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you oh we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like what five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst one is the people who who already have high pay lah because their
their lifestyle is already like uh I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard lah
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
eh why gym close ah cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
oh my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was originally like a
uh
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase ah then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good ah because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay ah obviously there's some limitations ah
but
ya he went to the extent
no ah because his house was too small like he he he showed uh showed the
like programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
ya
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
savage love ya I don't know but then like
it's quite cool ah because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun ah
oh my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren tan that one or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like eh you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside ah like what if what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable sia but I like the concept
it's like
yes
ya
mm but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
oh my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during eh during primary school
um
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like uh they showed uh around lah like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube kan
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
ya
a'ah
ya
more thick
to make it more thick
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything ah
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant ah I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like uh
actually I saw this one whole circuit
oh like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenhouse effect ah
ya question ah
oh my god
bicycle
excursion ah
their did mature more environment friendly too
unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements
oh my god ya you know they they estimate the island to be like filled up by like I think twenty forty or something like not even that far away sia
ya we'll be fourty then like also like eh oh my god eh ti you know what's the best way to make singaporeans like not use plastic bags
where
make them pay for your plastic bags
because singaporeans don't like to pay extra for anything
you just stand oh the plastic bags extra twenty cents
you know like nowadays at supermarket right they always do like the

ya
but inclusive of err house owner

um like the five of us just a separate one lah I think she will appreciate that okay ya ya
err ya just more of a
ya it was supposed to be the ninth whatever
ya
ya for me I think it's more of
just ah iskandar I think they if you see like ah anything that is pertaining to family ya or the family like she won't really like
say out you know I think ya I think and that's that
ya
thing
ya
ya
actually that's come a long way man she is the first nisa I know
that hung out at like ah sarah porch and like we all hang out five of us or four of us
ya she she's come a long way man she just got pissed drunk nisa
pissed drunk it used to be like err you want some ah no no it's okay thank you now it's like ah where's the cigarette yana where's your cigarette
aiyo that girl
know that day like err the staycation lah with me ah it's my birthday ah
I I I just lay down on her lap and I just started bawling
like bawling
my emotions I'm like ya I I
no babe it's not just her I think if any of us is like no longer a part of the group or even if let's say some shit happens some drama happen and one person just decide to okay
you know evaporated that's we will feel one babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen lah I mean
ya kan
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
tini
no to tini to tini so
no so it's not that um
on that day
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told tini
pizza
so sarah
no she and I and I told tini tini
um this tini and then sarah went ballistic already ah cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no tini didn't want to talk what
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause oh maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
um and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to ah she she said that
err bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could ah tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
nisa did nisa did
eh nisa did and then I I put also eh tini we miss you ah we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that what
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
I I will never do things like that
hurt
ya
ya right ya
so ya lah
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
I cannot just force someone to like trust or ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya
you know you talk about all these cliche romantic things like till till death do us part in sickness and in health and all this bullshit it's not bullshit really like it's not it just doesn't apply to a marriage or a boyfriend girlfriend and like
even even with nisa sometimes you know like ah I'm not comfortable ah talking about it like good then I'm like great nisa thank you like no I respect that

I don't know whether if this will effect F forty five in anyway but
tabata but not tabata
but there's a lot of variation in different different

limited limited edition
okay so what are you what's your plans tomorrow how about that
mm
okay
same until I got C for my malay
no for my H one also I got c
ah
h one C eh
I hope it's accepted to actually talk like this but I think so eh because it's they say is to to talk normally
mahadhir
oh ikmal
wow
ah just saying it's recorded again
okay um
um eh but actually you know I was thinking kan actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line kan
kan you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
err
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if lah I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting lah
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
ya
ya okay
hmm
mm
ah
ah
okay
mm ya ah
ah okay I
err
saying it to the people listening to this err we are currently students and if you have any err
part
ah
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
I was cutting you so
oh twenty seven more minutes
eh that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from eh
just gone
statistics eh
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
I told cause I
err maybe bell curve also lah
no lah but actually is is is helpful for those that
err don't do well eh wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
actually it doesn't help hor
you just fail
oh ya actually he's true ah
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this eh
no nobody can see your forehead
okay ah just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
um
maybe five metres
overhead eh no overhead bridge is four point eight metres oh four point five ah
oh you want to take
class three ya err
okay lah
ah I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips ah
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
that place let's call it um
eh I took my err I would say I took as school students so not private lah
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
err
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard err they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
but I would say the no lah not my age lah
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
I just pick the cheapest lesson lah so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
mm you think you are correct or not
you think
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
ya some more I I was so pissed lah but then
I think at that point I was just still
yes
so the first two times
err it was last year twenty fourth december err because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
err my test and then
err it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
err
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard sharul ya and then I heard sharul ya this year then I heard sharul pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night
but I was happy
then like I don't know I think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore I I really wanted to drive beccause I
and then I was
ya then some more
err during my
so my test was err example it's on monday right then on the saturday I book with this err I book the practice session then I was so stress that I feel like I didn't attend the lesson

good looks or a fit body
for your partner
I don't have both
hmm
okay so good looks ah
K good looks
ya lah I want to ask now lah so choose first
good looks or fit body
K
good looks or personality
then
ya lah something like etol lah you cannot say that he has good looks what
siala
I told you I didn't want that
I told you what
there's a possibility that
um
mm
mm
I would prefer
oh okay okay uh good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K lah I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
the distance between each eyes is like right
you can wear mask what
okay err
the the ugly ah
why
hello I'm with one
I rather be with an ugly one
then with someone who stinks like shit like aman
okay err
mm
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
err
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay lah one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
huh
huh
I don't understand
mm
mm I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no lah in singapore first lah
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya lah what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and uh basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya lah with the money then I will do that lah
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills what and then the cats I rescue them and then what feed them what
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya lah
cause I will invest also what so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
huh
uh uh I cannot lah
volunteer ah
then you get to play with the cats sia so cute
bring lah
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats

cause his family also like
his side
if I'm not wrong

cause I don't know ah I want to release this fast lah this year I want to try to release all the best ambling with lah
err yes
ya that's why
that's why
I think he he he manages to save some before that then at least during going to the phase of the wedding he doesn't really struggle lor
like struggle so much lor if not wah walao eh if you always like you push away everything right then you just want to focus on that marriage marriage or wedding ah
it's a wedding
yes
correct is focusing on the wedding instead of you focus on the marriage cause if you don't know leh like you spend so much so much on
one day and then you struggle for so many months for that one day ah walao eh
money in your then
then plan plan plan plan plan after five years can sell you upgrade ah
ah actually true
very small sia
err true same cause three resale three room bigger sia
like you more spacious old lah old a bit but then at least spacious you got space you can like
err true
wal house small err mamat house also quite small
same same as wal house yes same
err
but also ya lah I think
zafran house big
correct earlier that one big his house big like other other people house like all very small ah like hud house also actually quite small eh
correct correct correct yadi house more cramp lah
cause I think he put a lot of things inside but I don't know lah but I don't know come back to sial
hopefully you guys get to tour lah next year at least next year lah
cause I think their wedding is september eh
kan
who
this october
wow
wow ya ya it's about time lah she also needs to settle down lah
ah she is I think she's good at managing time also ah ah I think she very disciplined ya but that's good lah at least she want to get married lah
ya at sofitel kan
part-time part-time cause I got see her on instagram then I ask where she working now ah then she say
where she get job lah cause I think she got laid off at the previous place ah
ya outram or tanjong pagar that one then after that then she say she get another job lah but good for her lah at least she but she knows how to manage lah she she say actually good with time and management lah that's why she can handle the
the rental that's the good part ah
so in a way he bo pian ah he come down ah
I mean just their style lah so so he bo pian ah he bo pian he like err so I text him like eh you jamming ah huh
ya true
oh beat a
okay lah but at least you guys went tour already sia
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
musically very strong ah
ya
ah
ah that's good
those dark waves
with little cost ah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
ya
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours eh is also to me an opener ah it's still fun ah it's still fun ah I mean as following tour ah so
yes
ya lah
but then again also I think it's not also about touring ah I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring ah you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe ah then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
ya so
mm mm
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
that's why
scared sia
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person ah
but ah lal recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs ah one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas lah lyric lyric wise would be dol lah cause his lyrics are actually very good
hakim fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
ah skate punk like a lot of
hakim is very propagandhi
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part ah
confirm blast kan
oh oh farhan eh
but but
ah ya
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel lah you can also hear that is double ah like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
right
I don't know ah is their style ah
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song ah that kind of vibe ah but then
ah ya ya
ya relevant bands ah
they they they they suck life ah or they suck ah actually personally I don't listen to them already ah like rarely listen to them
penny wise will still be that sound ah cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
err still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album what
last year ah not bad lah but still the same sound ah
I like penny wise but I still prefer
ya ah professor professor sia vocalist professor siol sia
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene ah they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like err surfers and skateboarders mah
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets ah but they are very intelligent people ah
tony hawk pro skater eh
no I don't like him ah
but cannot ah
but okay lah see how lah missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause wan G got a new bass
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
ah I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape one then he just need to redo the everything ah so he give to hakim hakim
maggot maggot ah maggot setting up for him ah then he gonna after that we jam ah
composer
all of us ah together but wan G is the one that do everything lah so
yes err so we input ideas lah ah like but but wan G will will wan G will do first lah at home then after that after he do
I don't know he ah to me it's okay lah
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something lah and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said eh
err better ah
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound eh I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
do it fast ah cause we delay too long already ah ah so we we we say never mind lah we we we told hakim next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you ah but because we already comfortable eh and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff lah
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like ah ah recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
ah bass man ah it I think is
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky ah I think I think he's damn lucky ah like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
good sounds for the band lah
so far his recordings are actually good ah his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good ah for me lah personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient yadi is lah
cause must commit correct must commit
cause hakim is very hardworking that is his his income pe his livelihood pe
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands lah but from what
sia
no no no he he got another reggae band
err
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer ah ya ya ya rizal
so I think recorded there also
err even stoned revivals ah remix sound that song oh no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it err make it into malay also err I think goodil eh
ya lah but how they do it right is like err err
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia esam esam australia esam will record
err we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here ah
ya but it also depends on him what he I don't know but
don't know ah but
I I don't know ah but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay lah I think zad also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good ah
youtube siao he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out ah into it ah
yes correct
but then see lah maybe maybe in future lah maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest ah but one thing about zad I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good sia cause he feels paiseh lah want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use lah I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks lah cause it's a wear and tear
ah
that's why
of course
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable what it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay lah I mean I understand
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
ah we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him lah if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever lah run everything if ah confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury lah so then
at least you know before to record we come here lah we help you to shift the whatever lah amp
ya shift the mic lah whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential sia
you're the
go to in a way go to guy you know
err cause of what you produce ah
so we'll see lah
don't know lah
I know he he some more him being very anxious guy
err so he needs to get out
he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya lah
no the thing is the no the walk that time the plan right zad was okay zad wanted to do it he injured what
ah
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental ah mental ah it's it is more of mental
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend what then then we just walk ah so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to punggol end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk ah
ah but azil also said never mind ah we take it slow ah don't don't
don't force yourself lah you know then to give up also now is like wasted sia ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself ah
twenty minutes half an hour after that aisyah like okay ah then we all like come lah let's go ah hafiz waiting
ah ah
so we had to walk for one plus click ah
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
so that was the slowest walk to punggol err settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
ah
siao
ah ah
oh there the park connector ah
go to coastal
east coast
it's wrong coastal the coastal tanah merah coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
ya so ya lah but don't know ah but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard ah
so ya lah but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
whatever we can cut we cut ah no lah but
yio chu kang sengkang cannot ah must go that way no actually right
oh cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the buangkok is the nearest to reach ah but that one is also quite a stretch ah
ah ah but but is like you walk walk eh park connector park connector then you see eh sengkang already
the other end then you go in front another bridge oh that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of sengkang
then you go to punggol so that from punggol the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay ah this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just sumang
so that sumang is the end the beginning of that sumang is like the end middle of punggol lah that sumang
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
so there's another route ah so there's another route to walk
but we see lah we try again ah
we see next time maybe end of the year lah okay lah K K K

hello
okay can alright mm
so how are you
ya lah you what have you been doing
mm
mmhmm
so
so
really
oh I don't like to work from home especially
about one month
I rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different lah
ya
how long how long
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
then my drink then how how how is that
effective ya
mm it's not at all also
oh my god and the
and he he is used to that
mm
and your room
oh okay
or
orh
mm okay so the experience is quite
okay lah for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
back to school already right
oh
oh one more month wow
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
wow you got
two months of holiday ah not bad ah you
mm
uh huh
like what
why
spent too much on what
oh how much you earn ah that that that job
mm
hundred per
oh
ninety nine
per night
wow
okay
makeup stuff
orh
Tampines
huh then how you travel seh
Yishun correct orh so you got straight bus there lah
technically lah a bit lah
compared to staying at ah compared to where you are now until
mm okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience what you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
uh
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K lah
mm
wow not bad ah you
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
uh the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the in the emtire human line
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up what
ah kan so if you are the first person it's the easiest job ah but quality check a bit hard ah
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
err we start at about nine kan then we need to
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the ah the rice is either you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target lah but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person ah so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
the industrial area at Woodlands there lah
mm so they needed manpower uh so they asked manpower from my company so so ya lor
mm
yup my current company lah so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them lah mm
mm
ya lor so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand lah what it means when you say fast paced
oh
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can lah
no ah you will learn one usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
and the pay is quite good lah
three K lah three K for I don't know how many weeks of working lah so ya
oh
oh
so you what you
oh okay okay can
mmhmm
mm
okay
oh
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup one
you just sign up only
mm then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
oh
oh but night shift though
mm
technically ah what time start
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight
so eight to eight err eight to eight ah
oh
okay lor can lah then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
mm I understand
how's you and Andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
mm ee I ask you first how's you and Andy
you and Andy on InstaStory
oh okay okay okay okay
oh
that's why you guys spend time together
mm
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
oh I mean
oh
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
understand each other
good lah good lah
mm
not talk
mm
well good lah good lah at least
in in this relationship the two of you
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
ya how long already ah
what
three years
not bad ah three years ah this is this the longest
mm
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay lah actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya lah because his side he don't make it he don't
uh his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya mm
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like hais eh cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
err me and him are dealing shitty stuff now lah so ya
do you know what he's working now
mm you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram ah
oh
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but uh under there's a sister company called
so err basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
mm so okay lah
ah so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people kan
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages uh different character
okay lah I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so um
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
fourth year in the relationship
okay so okay ah now I explain to you what happen
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me ah oh um
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like uh means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
get it so means ah means ah like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about Lina that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
ah so that is the first time it happened
ah it
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
not interested lah because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is err volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
ah
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional uh breakdown ah I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp lah like
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating lah but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct a'ah
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kan uh
ya
this is what I'm trying to say lah don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
like limited talking to new people
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is um
err way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say ah this is me ah this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit lah
so ya hais
no I don't know because
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up uh like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me ah if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya lah
like that's why when you things like uh on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
ah I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know lah
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
not exactly lah
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
mm
mm
but you you do try to recover after that right
mmhmm
mm ah that's the word make up
mm
ya lah
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
kan
mm
mm
mm mm
with him
mm at least at least a goal with him kan
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like err am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
ya so now I'm just like
uh like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I
met his parents
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
haiya ya lah the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
mm eh
like
kan kan so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
mm
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
so far so far during this period right
where uh like
mm
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story lah okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware sia
err like I don't know a week ago maybe
he's
I know I understand
hais
hais
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only lah I hint to my mother only lah
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to uh
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya loh
on my Instagram I think people can like oh okay Hans and Lina is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
mm
too
I have fallen for him too hard that uh now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person lah but
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
ah it's just me expressing my emotions
mm and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
huh
ya it affect
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
I'll just knockout ah so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing lah
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
then
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so um
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already lah so that is good enough
hmm ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand lah
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
ya ya ya ya
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy seh
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space seh that is good that's what I need eh
we just need a different type of um router ya
ya
kan that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
mm
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
how many wifi you have at home
oh you have two
one is at
mm so you are connected to your
parents' one
mm
ya
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
mm
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now ah
err
I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one err some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
mm
ah
uh
mmhmm
no just now one is because I had to do a a mini training for this ah tomorrow's training
ya
ya so ya lor
then anyways so I am starting another job again cause I was just
I was like quite happy that I I'm out of the community club
then on Tuesday I am back I'm going to
ah ya is to I'm going to do some homeless job you know as in err
pay to maintain the the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just COVID things ah it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
uh
mm
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
huh
your is
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why I never like you get to experience internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
as an intern
it's okay lah you already pass through the err internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
being what broke oh you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
September
ya you're graduating April right
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
it's your choice
mm
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business ah
mm explore your options ya
ya eh not bad seh you went through like different certificates seh
kan kan then then when you have a kid right you when you have a kid right then you can say which one you want to know
I went through all ya
you went through N O uh and higher NITEC then diploma if you take
degree you go degree ah if you go further ah all also you have
oh it runs in the family
uh uh
ya like that ah depends ah what you want
me

I got no motivation so ya

based on experience ah just saying
okay
free

okay one thing that I wish was free
err
it'll be hard ah
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
unless other places but I've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
I've heard
yes yes eh actually that's very good points ah a'ah sia healthcare

and then I ordered my pram already
then she can don't walk too much aduh
okay diaper full also ya

um so how is school these days
ya true
october
you know
um
then
sarah also oh
me and nashrul all meet ah
cause sarah also busy with her
but
then supposedly my is like tuesday and thursday
but um now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so um
when your exam start bro
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
for me like for example eh
um I would consider ah because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
exhausting ah like what I see that's why I really
then for me also like my results it's um released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also eh will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like um because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
so like
maths jer for that day so like after that day they will like grade us oh how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want lah of course my expectation is higher
my A also my my A
I think is not a lot also
then
so like
um
it's okay
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them oh what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure um and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise kan and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me lah then my daily grade from
like it's important subject lah
so ya um
then
for sure but um for my actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable lah
teacher will give us like uh practice questions to do
eh eleven five nine
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time um
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to um type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for is
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before um eh like when you presenting and all
then um for me kan like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
whatever I say kan confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya um
ya
and then
also ya
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
mm
ya
ya
mm
ya
ours
is different seh we like on that day kan the presentation on that day you have to ah prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break lah kan
ya
mm
and it was uh two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
ya
mm
mm no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
eh but for her kan NAFA
really
oh
eh wow I didn't know that
oh my god that's so much friends
seriously
ya
for sure
I'm proud of myself like wow
ya same
same lah as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see um every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
um gone
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family kan is like

test and
okay hi I'm amir I and my partner salamah
okay so first conversation was how
a bit
but I think it's the perfect time ah
I mean when it comes to like face mask from what
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth lah
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time ah I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend lah
you you imagine you
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it what like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay ah so I think the house fly was
ya I guess so I was fine
ya you don't know meh
ya lah it's just that I got the most freshest one lah
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license lah my motorbike license like
I
I don't
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement lah but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is like way better lah
it's not a tipping thing ah like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean you cannot
that one is they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think like the their
like it's just
ya I got it for six eh four hundred plus lah like because
I mean long term ah and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
ya ya
I mean
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
blind blind spot
I I think I might feel fail someone from the the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing ah
ah
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
you license ah you
so you know how the the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out ah as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe ah
so I think
but before that defensive riding lah
so
ya
but I think I
ya
no
ya
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I I think the bike I'm looking for is err the one like my friend is riding I think one five zero or one five
ya ya okay that one I
I I don't even know what
those brands are like ah because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the I mean somewhat fuel efficient is one five zero ah
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years ah
like I I need to decide first whether because like if I were to do my work
ya
I just keep renting ah depends on like what bike I want then
like at the at the like a dead end
what was the question I have to remember oh was it something like okay what is the
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
um
like
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
so I think
ah ya
I mean I am okay grand if it's just the person that I want
ya
ya lah I mean but like honestly
like like what you say lah or whatever if the person has done but then ya lah but
like you have to know what the person like intention of what a birthday is lah for me
they have to know lah like like it's not gonna be feasible lah for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay lah whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday lah a holiday or something eh
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do lah a road trip
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker lah it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
oh
okay ya so ya lah I mean wait this six hundred is a lot lah so

okay
I think you can start the conversation
hello
so let's begin our conversation
what about you
oh ya
today
so basically just now I went for meeting for the final meeting for my for my commission project
satisfying
no lah I mean
for my first time commission project for my first ever commission project not firstly lah first time lah
consider
well I mean they are willing to pay me two hundred
almost three hundred because I
actually order her modern dress
she lost weight
ya so actually I that was supposed to be the only fitting
but turns out
but turns out she lost weight so I had to do alteration
her her arm pull drop
yes she lost five
she lost five I gain more I gain more than that she lost five
I get
she don't like it or is too much
ya
the things is the part right
the part is okay but with the waistband the arm hold
trying to find the fit
just ya the jumping part I'm bad at that
but okay lah
no that's like ruffle
yes
I don't know maybe is my drafting is wrong
like the curve of the arm hold shouldn't be too curvy
but I think my one is sharp
it was supposed to be like right ya I think mine is
very high
you know when I is like I sew
I didn't actually follow the entire thing
I just dug in
so you still the
yes
you seen esah's engagement right

I wish you she want something
the
you know those floral crop top like lace
the rustic theme I will say no no not rustic

you've already went for interview for your job right
how did it go
the zoom is about
and it has been two week eh no
at work not at home
and you haven't start
hmm one month
or is it prorated
so the cut off date is eh there's no cut off date is not is a full time pay right
but that you only get paid mid of the next month
ya
this is like my workplace the full timers get paid mid month no twenty twentieth every twentieth of the month they get paid
my one for temporary is only end of the month they actually not ended end of the month
is not even end of the month is seventh of the next month
what
what is actually right there is no cut off date some more so it it's look like you're working
forty days
but you get paid can already
but most of my bills will be end of the month my phone bill
oh gym
still ah anytime fitness
F forty five
oh Fitness First
best
ya
what
I also don't understand clementi is
uh huh
huh what is all these polis
oo okay
is it like walking distance
oh
office
ya is because like now you don't have
you know err a proper working schedule
so you can go any during the non peak hour period
okay that is cheap
for one month
no lah like how did
oh is cute
huh
not one three six anymore
so everytime they will change the
cost of the
actually
like the promo will not end lah
mmhmm
oh
but you are paying the insurance no
so that is equal
like one fifty lah roughly
ya because is cheapest deal
hmm
but how do you know like whether you are doing the right form
oo
oh ya
but have you ever thought of joining F forty five
you were from F forty five what usually when you go to work no meh
you were still working there
during the F forty five trial
you were still working with us right
yes I remember
yes
it was
mm
but after that you never continue your F forty five
and lesson oh ya
I want to try sia
yes
except for you
ah
mm
ya
you mean by reps ha
oh my god
I know one of the one of my senior from poly
but
what I know now she is working at
F forty five as a trainer which is shocking
mmhmm
she's fit but
again she begin without any experience from fitness
then
no don't have she she was just a freelancer for graphic design
then now she's a trainer
if you see right
all her videos her
story
she will be training at the gym itself
at the studio at F forty five studio
and she improve a lot sia
east
serious are you are you serious right or are you joking
but gym trainer I I mean the receptionist
sure
yes
maybe after closing ah
after closing you just close the gym and then you can have the gym to yourself and no training that's all
yes is not the receptionist job hey got a cleaner for a reason
barry barry what's that
B A
woo
oh okay wow
they all so fit
khai friend what happened
as a receptionist
okay what is he doing now
khai
why
mmhmm
oh okay okay okay
what
mm
he bailed
okay
ya
hmm
they just throw him in the office
and give him work to do right away
no training
oh my god
then he quit
like said goodbye to them or just
very what will be like so tragic like if you went then they might where the new guy
did the the manager or supervisor call him
ya
well ya
but then the part of the contract term is
oh is the just for this job is just for two month so there's no contract lah
then it's okay ah
then got
how much is he paid for this two month
huh
ya and he has it's office hours monday to friday
one point five
really meh okay lah my first
but not admin
no pay lah like he he he didn't even clock in the entire day is only one hour then he zao
wasted sia
ya what happened to the brooks brother
no the thing about her
ah I
last september
then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for uh for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of err end of september
the end of september
seven or eight october
then uh when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her lah luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said oh is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this one she just disappear
ya
I mean come on lah I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about uh our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said oh my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said oh the rejected don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking lah
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay ah
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K what so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine leh
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until
from
changi
yes ah
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
so of course lah I understand why she is angry lor then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more eh four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home one point four eh one point six ah one point ya ya
ask maybe
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know lah like try your luck lah then she said
no lah but then if I said it like that right surely my the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
kan
cannot lah sia I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
and do the interview
is the right
but that means she has go through
no
sad sia
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy eh
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission lah but still we are still doing our job
actually their their pay is is good leh for full timer
two point six
email lah I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay ah
yes and is not only that sia
the big boss will be
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave mah I want to clear my leave
but if let's say
this year cannot applied already december somehow december there's already people on leave already
and december is the christmas period so you cannot already
good luck ah I I thought taking leave cause my contract end second february so first second and the last two days of january I take leave then I zao already lah
good right don't need lah for what
come back for what said goodbye
I don't have pass
is just uniform I can give them on my last day all clean ya
I don't need that or probably they ask me to wash after that I come back one full day one of the days to return the uniform
and pins
they don't they don't care
from what I know lah
hopefully like let's said I rather not take my leave and get paid
you know you get you can get paid right if you never take your leave
ya ya ya
but I'm sure they don't want to pay the extra
if one hour ten ten dollar
one day eight point five hour
so eight five eight five times four three hundred plus
I rather take that three hundred then taking leave
but if let's say I can applied leave
from
no plan
actually
yes
no the thing is he offered me a
but it's more like I design for him a collection he wants to come out a clothing brand

then end up COVID then they just
then like even lesser people came

hello my name is hady
hello faidil um how have you been
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have um the first question for you my first question is um just the other day I was walking outside um an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone ah that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself um I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its um
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
um for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
so ya that's my opinion
um my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with err the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
ah ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
um ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
um ya um that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who um don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash um just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
mm yes
um that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with um the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why um I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
um temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest um mind reading um I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
um
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
um ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
ah ya before I say the three skills I master I um I agree with your last point about being able to
um be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
hmm
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and um you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch and if so what genre of do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great um I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
um ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for shows I would go with master of none starring aziz ansari
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe um five hundreds days of summer
starring um zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
um ya and
regarding the questions about I'd say in this generation maybe is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
um ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp um I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste ah so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
um my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty um console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods tour maybe or maybe like
um
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
um ya lah um
just
I can't I can't really think of what else lah to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with faidil as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said lah um I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time ah
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question um my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
wishes
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be um being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club lah cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
um if I had a third wish I would just um in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily um for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
um if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe wagyu beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
um
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always um
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
um um
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
um wow um those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think lah obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten lah what about you
um ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
um wow um first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek um a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
it's just a waste of a life ah and what's your thoughts
um ya for sure um I feel like
um the awareness itself about mental health is very important um obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you faidil
oh should should I go first ya um first of all I'd say there's a lot that I am thankful for to be born in singapore um first of all
I'm very thankful that my parents have been able to live a stable life being here um I myself have been able to been raised up in a good community in a good place living in a block
and um and seeing what my parents have to work for just to be able to afford to send them to school to send them for their hospital meetings all and seeing the cost of it itself I'm very thankful that the government helps to cover and
I know my dad has never said it but I'm quite sure he is very thankful as well
and I I just hope that
me and the people around me will be able to work hard and just live a stable life in singapore
how about you faidil
um I also like to give a shoutout to all the nurses who work during the COVID um period we are also very thankful that they putting the hours everyday cause it's been a it's been crazy times for singapore for the whole world and it just I like to give my appreciation I'm sure my friend faidil feels the same way and with that I faidil thank you for talking to me today I'm sure we talk about a lot of stuff a lot of different stuff today did you have a good time

like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
april kan lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it

okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would mulan do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched lah but I don't remember lah kan
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about mulan
so mulan kan
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
woman is not required to go for this one what this one
ya woman cannot go
but then why is she forced to go
oh okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
I watched before
no no no I watched already you see
mulan go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick

I don't know ah got there's just a lot of stupid thing I did in secondary school
then my class was just winning like every single game ah
I don't know how
okay you imagine this triangle eh
then you draw two lines inside
so this is the field this is the goal this is the goal so maybe you just throw to your team mate that's in this uh right rectangle he score
so what my team did
so
I will just in the middle again all I had to do
was to capture that intercept the frisbee from the opponent
okay
so once you okay let's say I scoring this eh I scoring here eh
I will throw to one guy at the back
this one guy at the back
just throw to him

then she say ah okay okay lah you drink lah
ya
after P six I don't know what got into me kan I became like the leader

actually my secondary school like drama

I think in most is situation I was the middle man in that fight
I was never the person that caused the fight
like the drama

in the whole lah I think
mm
what did hannah do
okay okay
sorry

that time we eat the dinner at Chatime
yeah and then you wanted to buy your first then you wait for so long
the brown sugar pearls right because its closing already ah I think that's why
two more weeks before intern
then what about you
hmm
I don't know seh I'm scared that I just hope that it will have that graduation ceremony lah if not we will be like the this year batch right they graduate through Zoom or Teams ah
yeah I know right will you miss school duh
but I'm glad it's all over already lah no the holiday where they enjoy
so what have you been doing ever since the holiday
yeah I see
ah for this semester
then get I get to poly this aviation course
but now a bit sad lah because COVID then aviation sector like
rabak lah
why
but okay lah we see how maybe I can go in maybe not I don't hope so much but I just hope the only hope I want is to be a stewardess lah I don't mind actually which airline as long as I get to as long as I get the dream job I'm working
what's your plan to do what's your plan tomorrow
yeah I watched that before I think that was in twenty sixteen or something around that year then I want to watch it again lah because its so nice yeah you should watch that
ha ha yes
yeah then ah do you want to watch a movie next week or something
train to busan
okay
what about you
eh you told me that ah she is going to stop working right
okay then how is your intern you got any updates
so you won't be alone lah
okay lah that's good lah
chey I thought you say like got maybe at least one more person with you at the same location so at least you won't be bored or you know
some more your house is at tung lok kiew right
and you are not familiar with place
its
it's still considered as internship lah because I'll be working with changi airport it just that I won't be getting salary lah
I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad lah because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate lah she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
but they still get they still get paid like high salary ah like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like wah so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship lah because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope lah between the project and the job
no who enjoy seh
why
for long ah
what aiyo
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but wah this semester my grades okay lah decent only lah its not the grade that I expected
so how err how was
okay lah but it's quite hard lah to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct lah better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
oh
same lah I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me lah you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID err finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up err finance or course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal lah that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
wah
I see like wah nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes oh now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
oh muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have err thoughts lah like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like err nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have err it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small one lah then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults lah those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
yeah true lah
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
like err it will be inconvenience for them lah you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport lah like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard lah even if you take a bus or you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
but I feel I feel like err cafes in the west is like
quite boring ah
like I said
oh
yeah we should sell like those viral food and drinks to attract people
oh is it
I've never tried dalgona coffee before
yes
have you tried do it yourself
how does it feels like
oh yeah yeah sure I okay lah I mean I always see other people I always see other people drink but then like I feel like I'm the one that haven't drink it yet
err I think so should have ah
okay okay we shall do it
then what other
food or drinks ah
have you seen any new ones
oh yeah the bubble tea
oh like everything bubble tea kan
oh yeah I tried before lah this cake err a business sell cake like they pour the sauce on it like chocolate sauce or I forgot what was the flavor but I remember that err there's a pearl on it I think oh it's milk tea cake so the the cake is like err
you know like those sponge cake kind of flavor then they have the milk tea sauce also just pour over it and then they have some pearls so become like a bubble tea cake yeah it's nice actually surprisingly yeah
I feel like going to hunt for food
you know cafe hopping
I never done it before
like since so many cafe but
you know I've never tried everything lah it just yeah I just want to go like for that day we go to different cafes to try their food
yeah
most importantly we need money
I want to go staycation do you want to go with me
I don't know lah oh actually we wanting to go staycation at sentosa

the total case per day is just two digits
okay lah I mean that's a good improvement I really can't wait
you know
so
okay lah let's
yeah I have a lot of game to play with you

ya
but then I feel like december kan school holiday
mm ugh
mmhmm
Pan Pacific service suite
um beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
mmhmm
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book kan
that's why they follow like
ya
eh eh sorry sorry
mmhmm
I think it's easy seh if you get like central
a'ah
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
oh
mm
is that the kitchen then
and then
uh
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya correct
oh
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
if not I can find for you also lor
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that lor
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
hundred dollars
ya my
uh huh
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think angah will
this hotel also nice
have you gone before
I think you went before
oh is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since angah like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
mm can ah
at Noosh Noodle Bar
eh we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
mm okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy ah
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
ah okay
mmhmm
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
why didn't you eat it's so good
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
if you like craving for it just go for it lah twenty plus dollars
because I think they have like fixed
um measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
then that time also I had this yakiniku you know yakiniku
the beef
Yoshinoya
oh no okay yakiniku is the
okay lah like that is after they yakiniku the beef mah
but yakiniku is basically you get
to grill the the beef
maybe because they yakiniku it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
that
that time there was only one halal yakiniku outlet
the asakusa temple area
ya
it's so nice one of the set was wagyu then I'm like
it's so soft oh my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
I mean it is technically lah but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like mee soto is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose mee soto okay I think I will pick
um
a'ah there's like so many things that I like
hmm
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why
you will eh she eh she got so many business
okay let's change it to celebrity
ya lah so celebrity who's
ya you have your own beauty line
some more you recently if you're rihanna you recently released the
the lingerie line
experience
a'ah
a'ah seh
maybe she got servants
she imaging the sleepover party
oh my god
a'ah
like got
don't know
ya
ya then after that I think he used
he used
and then they put there as a meme
oho like the circuit breaker
a'ah
ya
was like I'm
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
oh my god
a'ah
that's why
a'ah
and then they have
a'ah movie room ya
I think probably we have the right to complain
aiya I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
a'ah
mmhmm mm mm
ah
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then ah if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
um
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like uh
a'ah
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
face
face is
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
err you still not a
uh huh
I like crime documentaries
a'ah a'ah
court cases
mmhmm correct
fight for their clients you no no no like he or she is not wrong
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya ya ya
right
popular
they still show but I'm not sure whether it's new seasons
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
ya I think hawk gate horror right I think it's
if the plot case is good
and then I think that um
a'ah
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
uh like you know I don't ya
it really happened
a'ah the original camera
so I feel like a bit like okay
tactic
something new
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
the longer ones right
there's this one one movie that she told
that there's huh
that she covered
uh huh a'ah ah
I haven't really watch
uh
mm kids
oh the movie is just recently
oh okay okay okay okay okay
oh okay
crime documentaries but then there's so many to watch
mmhmm
stress
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
and she effectively you know
expecting
mm
okay I will watch soon I think tomorrow
I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
this can happen you wish
mmhmm
or is it
okay like when you
ah okay okay
a'ah a'ah
true
castle
like
a'ah
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think everybody
I think primary school
but then it
oh
mmhmm
SARS is just singapore
I don't expect
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
father daughter or like kids
mmhmm
what is it oh your your
father is infected with COVID so
I think uh
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like oh
I think like
like he
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
be hygienic
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a duh
oh ya ya ya
sembawang
who
he's like so young
ya
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
interning gag
grants and all that
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
a'ah
a'ah
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries lor
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card lah
I think they like
people
from other working at other places eh like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under lah then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
ya
so when they
oh um we actually this this grant is not under us so
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
because it's also what
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's mah
I mean like okay lah if you allowed there's there's
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day uh
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your uh at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like huh
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
uh can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
hmm)(hmm
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand lah but then you know some people when they like
a'ah
that's why I say
ah
because now
now also everything is online
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
need to go down mmhmm
a'ah
ya it's like that so yes
mmhmm
mmhmm
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
the um financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
as in the application that the application for the
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot lah because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
mm ya
at the
ya
ya
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
issues with the
employers
ah
because they um employees from different different company mah so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
uh
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like oh
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office what
just be mentally prepared lor
mm
no lah
mmhmm
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
dah
that time you went for the medical interview ah
you went already
ya
ya the immunity is lower lah basically
oh okay
oh really
oh okay
oh it's at a landed property
oh okay okay I think I seen
it's a child care
oh okay then how many
children you have in there
so do people like teach
over there or no
do you have to teach them anything or no
oh okay

oh
okay okay okay

oh okay and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh like um japanese and get japanese korean and sweden that swedish within
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
uh
oh

said so we are going back one hour ago
so
because I I myself also got um work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is ah the pay to me is I tell you lah it's quite it's quite ah quite decent for I would say err part time lah because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get lah so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that one is motor lah but ya lah but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders ah per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
a good place for you to like start lah then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
marina barrage
marina tower
marina got what marina bay sands
six hours
huh so fast wait you run or you walk you walk
so fast then why why when we
maybe maybe we I should I should start with you ah what nine five five
five five eight

it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot ah too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
uh how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but uh
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the not contemporary ah english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
uh uh lah okay lah then I I have to agree with you lah we go we put the partition that means
eh ya lah correct lah when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like um
ah like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
chey private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt lah all that lah so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny ah
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like uh
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
mm
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
uh mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
uh or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
mm
eh but the other day I went through um this hard zone or something lah the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across uh this person
uh he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else lah then it's already two K
just the platform
mm
I put uh under
uh extra budget column
in the planning lah so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then ah the service balcony you know the
the doorway um between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills uh window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it what so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay ah
mm
actually not bad leh you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that uh different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
wah I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
uh came to real life you know really eh so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like uh extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this one is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
ah
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else oh ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
err like the window grill I don't know
so but then that one I haven't research uh
but uh ya
I think I think it's because ah it's already old lah that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not what it's supposed to be tight what like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the uh the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this one capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical uh wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya lah that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia lah because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
uh recipients
eh but eh but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back yay belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house ah you watch the host ah hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
eh but the new season uh the other day I was uh randomly uh looking for right
and then I saw uh one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
um the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was ah what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this one this time round is this company aiya I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually uh watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this ah if not actually uh three D innovation is good leh
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
uh what do you call that low income families eh
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them ah because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget lah maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what ah you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper lah okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back uh
oh we didn't even say anything but he himself say that uh we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years eh the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the uh what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that one
uh wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman seh to install our this one the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only lah that one okay lah but even so uh remember the
the also not proper
hollow eh
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask what we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
uh and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to hafari right
then ah then after that mm
either that or he know that he never do correctly lah he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable what right because ya it's a expensive tile
mm
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope lah we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet uh already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know uh like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the uh is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that one will reduce the cost ah cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist uh off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have ah that one already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
ah
ah package ya two standard
mm
mm
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
oh double
ah
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if uh whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same uh the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need uh
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own uh contractor for the vinyl right
ah when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
ah
ya it is the newest click function that one right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own one but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
ha
ah
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in uh kids room
oh
ya
eh mm
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company uh he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give what remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
mm
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that one cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know uh overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that one also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is uh I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean eh you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
hmm
vinyl
mm
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this one remember this one got two option we this one is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move one without lesser groove
ya
maybe that one cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser ah grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
mm
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop uh water sucking mop what
that one that one you won't go into the groove
ya lah it suck water the mop suck water right
ah
okay water absorbing mop
oh
oh that one
that one very expensive that one is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but ah make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous eh that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old uh oh now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M one but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
huh difficult have what
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home one you go and find no
only that brush sial no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
ah
okay so uh actually oh I forgot to tell you I uh I sign up through Renopedia
and then um through there there will be contacting me ah like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even uh ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection lah so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us lah through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia what right
so is all go back to our own research ah
actually they say um doesn't mean the very the company eh very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the uh company but I must also research uh and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
ah hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then uh also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then err
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go uh down and uh have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give lah
ya uh but I haven't show you then I I even I even uh wrote down their names the
uh
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
oh ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down what
mm
it must be a balance ah we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
ah to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

oh what was the last movie you watched on netflix
mmhmm
oh
house
don't know
oh it's a comedy
mm haven't watch it
wah
true
ya that's true
huh oh
ah
I think the last movie I watched was movie eh I haven't watch movies in awhile but I watch like series
ya
the acting is not that great the the also not that great lah but
no it's british ya
it's quite interesting lah I mean the storyline also not that amazing but it passes time
ya
the boys
on netflix
oh
oh
mm
oh
okay
mmhmm
mm
mm
like what what's the storyline about like what basically happen
okay
amazon prime I don't have sia but might I might subscribe cause got a lot of like interesting shows I've heard and netflix is like running out of stories
isn't much left
ya
amazon prime
orh
ya
mm
interesting
mm
I know you take forever to watch a show
mm
mmhmm
ya
mm true
mm
I think they did it was like fourteen the last time now it's like sixteen
oh great
haiya it went up
ya they added now
ya
mmhmm that day I received this
ya but I don't know ah I think not yet
true
mmhmm
oh
oh wow
what is it about
but what is your course like mainly about
huh okay
oh yes
I mean that's fun I guess managing a business
mm
uh huh
mm that's true
I don't know
I mean
oh ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
oh how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
mm
mm
then what happens
true
mm mm
mm
but like
sad sia they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market uh like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game eh without the players what do you have like an empty online page
mm
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
and that's what has been happening what like the
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
kan
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
ya
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that lah
ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
it's probably him ya
I don't know sia
ya and he spent so much on that game also what I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
oh ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want sia
I don't know
cute sia
oo is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
kumbhakarna
yes
mmhmm
mm
oo
and another person orh
hmm that's hard good looks or fit body
mm
then yourself leh
mm
yes
ya
true
true
mm
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
good looks
ya
hmm
no any other day hmm
and
ya
oh ya not not bald lah no lah like as in like short
I don't know I
mmhmm
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
but ya
ah
um
mm ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
like tag along so like
huh really I didn't know
oh you didn't say
did you say oh I didn't see
I didn't
oh no he means he can't even play at all ya
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my
ya
mm
just one mm
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
ya so you like
mm
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
kan
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
oh
I guess
I guess
mmhmm
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to ah like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
yishun
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
ya let's go look for that cow later
is there
interesting we go find out lah
kan
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
oh
I mean the
I mean there's still one that exists that like
she owns the place basically and then like uh
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened lah when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
mm ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like oh I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
like really late and then ah they wanted to start filming at like eight
model or something
so she's quite tall lah and then like um
her features were like pretty lah like
like a model person's features
mm that part that was the one lah
ya
mm ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying lah cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
so like
like wandering around and shit
ya
I think the the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
then we just like like we told them lah like oh we're filming a horror movie here
but it's quite interesting place ah cause it's surrounded by
that hut that looks like a kopitiam
but it's exist now ya
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the so it's quite quite cool
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor lah
so like ya
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
oh visit huh there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven
the there's a road that goes through the entire place lah so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people lah
and but we only hear like
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like paiseh ah cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the stuff
so like
and then um
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like oh wah so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya
she just goes around does that every time
ah but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice ah it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
um
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting ah the place
interesting
um
I honestly don't know ah I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night lah
ya I think same ah if like I had to like
true
but
oh ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
mm
mmhmm
really
that's interesting
uh the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes sia is it even open I think it is already lah if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
pulau semakau that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
three years quite recent lah ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
orh orh
catty
catty enclosure
mm
and jumping on things
mm
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed lah like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible lah to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age sia the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from yishun
yishun has cold weather and move it
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not meh
it was
it was lah cause I don't remember wearing for things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
uh five to two
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya sia
sec four lah so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
orh
it's quite pretty lah the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and changi airport
hmm
that's a hard question
but legit lah like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
oo
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
hmm
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job oh my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
mmhmm
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
mm
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
oh ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
mm
ya previous
mm money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
mmhmm
mm
so what the hell
wow
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
oh
mm
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your right it's literally does nothing different
mm
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no in it ah so like
probably not
mmhmm
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
mm
mm
no one was interested
ya
mmhmm
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay lah to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
mmhmm
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like oops
I mean if it had if had like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
mm
mm
mm
true
mm
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
mm
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
orh
same
I just I cannot imagine like
oh
I was like huh
ya
oh that's weird
the hell
mm
mm
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
orh
mm
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
mm
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
that's when it gets bad lah like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it lah but like it's fine uh it's fine lah he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
oh really
orh
I mean get scared lah like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine lah like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
mm
mmhmm
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic what then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die lah confirm but like
oh
mm
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
mm
is put to use
ya
mm
somewhere else
that needs it
mm
mm
mm
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next president should just remove money
there is not no money
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
ah ya

nonsensical sia like how

so I mean I procrastinate lah so it took me like
like I I I know I know the
is it march was it march that they open or was it march that they're closing
ya ya ya okay so march
the second week of march then I'm just like okay I need to do I need to do my stuff
exactly but okay but then they still send me oh okay ah
oh you've been shortlisted so please do our online interview
ya I do the online interview but I screwed up entirely
okay let me tell you okay so basically right there was one weekend where okay we you know that time we're in right
ya so
it was
so
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like mm
don't know what to do ah
okay then once my
then I was like okay lah I need to do something ah the deadline coming close
okay I start I do I do all the needed documents
I print err not print I search for all the
err err what what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
I dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig
then err they want us to submit that online
okay so err at that point of time I applied for two course
which is one is the course that you're in what is it ah what is it called
okay okay so I applied for the is honours kan
okay okay
like okay ah maybe one application or
one choice a bit too little lah so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and ah eh is it I don't know okay okay
so I was like okay err maybe I I put two ah so one was
infocomm security then the second one was
err
I think some design or

and when ah they ask for my portfolio I was like what
okay okay okay I I have no idea how to put this portfolio

no because okay I haven't finished my story eh sorry sorry
so there this is where I realised
that um the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about err entertainment or something ah
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should ah so
ya that was when I realised ah so
what I did was I
like uh screw it ah I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like oh okay
ya I only applied for one option lah I only put one choice

I see as a I see it as the is it am I too soft or what
blessing in disguise will you say
like you know how he like you say ah is like okay um
revolves around teamwork
team collaboration
team effort
okay so
now
the moment COVID strike
everything is done online on Zoom meetings
whatever forum that they try to
implement within that short period of time to ensure
students still can um collaborate do team effort all that
but I feel like like err this current time this current period is like the the most
err hardest ah I feel
ya
uh huh
something like that
err honestly eh I might
might not lose a lot within this year that I have a gap
I mean I'm still losing money ah that's the main thing ah
uh I mean I guess you can say this recording ah
no lah I mean
honestly speaking I'm trying to look for a job I applied for a job but right now
okay at first I feel like okay at first I thought okay ah maybe I should try to apply something related to what
I want to do in the future
then okay so I look look look see see see for any like opening cause like
most of the people that they're looking for are like oh two three years of
err the experience that you are
relevant ya then I was like what
ya lah ya lah I mean
I can apply but okay you know the
the united
uh traineeship or something like that programme
okay so
okay
august like I was like okay ah
ah maybe I'll get my one more pay in september
you know
you know that that that expectation okay ah so I was like I didn't
I didn't bother to look for any jobs ah during august to september
um early september
like
last month lah
okay okay okay sorry sorry
okay so
I expected september
to get my last pay ah but
then I I I ask me
I ask my lah eh can you help me check
err are we supposed to get paid uh september then he was like ah okay okay I'll get back to you
then after that
ah he he came back and then he said oh no your
how they pay is like
ya you're paid for that
month that you're working
rather than
uh something like that maybe
so
then I was like oh shit
that means like I won't get paid lah on the september
ah
ya
what is that
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
wow
not bad not bad
Adidas eh
ah okay
oh
eh ah
oh oh oh oh
my bad my bad no I I I I mistaken sorry sorry
sixth october that's
I think about a week from now
ah
cause um
bill from their system
okay
so then uh the the person in charge they like oh err
can you come to the
computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like oh err are you still are you still in are you still serving
then I was like oh ah I just finished I just like
last week then she was like uh okay okay then I have to remove you from the eleven B scheme oh man
that was like ninety eight dollars
hais
ya lah
ya lah of course ah I I expected I need to pay but I
was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
mm huh
hais
I was like
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that one is before err ah but six months is a very long
think so I don't know lah
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing ah
a'ah
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work ah honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
eh I would not think twice
I just
ya serious ah
one last talk
oh I see
oh I see
uh huh
a'ah
I see I see
no lah okay so uh
and then
to eh no sorry my
and then basically then go up to ah so there's this
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
err
err expect a lot from the from us ah
standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
a'ah ya
and okay so you know how in
err they say oh okay err the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the one doing all this err
all these checks right correct
uh huh okay
so we also have the
we also had the schedule lah
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
err the one that we don't like lah
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about err the duty err is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
then
so this directing staff came down he was like oh err what time already I was like huh
what do you mean he's like err why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like huh
what you expect sia you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check ah
you get what I mean
ya lah
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check ah rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like ha
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
so we're like err when when I going it was like ah don't care already ah because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already ah
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies ah
um
okay okay
what you have done lah ha
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
oh don't have eh
okay then I guess err
mmhmm
okay lah but okay that

no not a lot of places like hiring like proper part-timer they are looking for like those contract full-timers
hais
mm
uh
oh yeah yeah I saw
yeah
yeah I think they will be on if they're free
yeah
mm
uh that's true
uh
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah that's right
ah
then the guy just continue walking
yeah like cause I was like that's genius
I mean if
yeah they said if the other person actually went up to him confirm get caught already then I was like wah very lucky
oh
uh yeah yeah
oo
I think it's more interesting than Mafia game lor
uh
oh yeah that's err
yeah
it's always so funny
yeah
ugh same
nope
mm
then he will be like what huh who are you
I mean err
I mean err I mean if you want to eat fish when you're pregnant is more unlikely
oh my gosh
uh yeah yeah
oo
eh
oo
mm okay
err I think different different courses hmm
I mean yeah but like I don't have
yes
yeah
then I go they change the plan then I feel bad what then it's like uh just go ahead lah without me
yeah
um yeah then but it's like I don't know if I mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that I cannot eat I think that is very alarming to me
then they were like never mind lah you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then I like
mm
that's why ugh
same is like they
oh my god yeah
exactly oh my god ugh
but how seh that time I topped up twenty dollar then I think I only went out like four or five times only then finishing then I'm like huh
err
yeah
that's like
mm
mm
I think so like that like that's what I remember
I mean
then it depends on your station also lah
mm
I think it's a very how to say ah first world problem I feel
mmhmm
right yeah
mm yeah
that's true
I
exactly then that's why I think it's considered a million dollar like idea I guess to have those wheelchair friendly buses
then I'm mm
no no you can
which is
yeah
mmhmm
yeah
mm that's true
that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
mm
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad lah because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
mm
yeah but I know their other senses will be heightened lah like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so I was like hmm I wish I was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
oh my gosh
mm
oh my gosh
yeah
it's like why why must have fire
there's no other word for it
mm
oh my god can you imagine me
my parents thought I was a boy then when they give birth it was a girl yeah they really thought I was going to be in a boy it was so funny
like
oh that one I never ask so yeah
okay maybe I should ask is wah
it's wah ya
so funny
it's like
it's like a sike eh like oh it's a boy oh no it's a girl sike
I think gender reveal parties are very I don't know it's so over the top
it's over the top yeah
yeah it's
I don't need to tell my friend who's a friend of this friend that I have a baby who's a boy and it might not be even accurate so
yeah I'm like um
ah yeah
mm
yeah yeah
mm
mm
eighty
is that like your commission or like your pay
ah yeah yeah
err
I mean you can't do anything if no one comes in
uh yeah
mmhmm
uh
oh my gosh
then
then then it's like should I be sad that there's no customers or should I be glad that there's no customers
mm
very easy money
hmm
I mean that's considered one of a good like working days I guess
uh yeah
that's true
oh
oh
oof
uh
right I'm still amazed that she did it eh
you are the one who made it
like
uh
I mean
mm understand
ah
mmhmm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah then is like you're like uh what is this ah then you scrape the frosting off
yeah
yeah that's true
that's why when we were bringing the cake in it's like wah Kelly the cake is so pretty
yeah
uh
yeah
yeah when you guys were working
aiya lah but it was just you know in case
then
right
yeah right I felt smart
that's why
and then I was like err what's Kelly's um faculty
and that's how we were discussing what to get for you
yeah
you know the round card right okay sorry side track but you know released err wah you know this whole week I think everyday right I think four days in a week right it released new merchandise then that one I don't care never mind

ya it's the weverse the the the the new fan cafe that one
yeah yeah it's so funny ah ugh
in the SOOP

a lot you know they are re-releasing the you know Skool Luv Affair album the repackaged version
right I was like oh okay no no no no no I don't need
don't tell me I don't have the money to do that this month
yeah
yeah that's why
I mean if you have the self-confidence and the self-esteem to wear it out go ahead girl or guy or whatever
mm
yeah they picked a very pretty shade of green then I was like genius
mm
wah yeah
twenty one is like the success is you can't even compare leh
it's
even people who are not their fans right see it and like oh is cute buys
oh I didn't know that okay
yes and it fits the aesthetic
mm
ugh
ugh don't even get me started on shipping ugh
mm
mmhmm
oof
mm
that's why ugh
if
yeah lah what's the point if I never buy the membership kit if I signed up
so I was like the thing I do for you guys
mm
what thing
that's why it's like you the thirty dollar you don't want to use for other things
right wah the thirty dollar I think I can buy my whole new outfit that I've been looking at leh
yeah Shopee lah what where else can I buy I am not that rich
yea yeah
yeah then the
uh yeah
yeah
aiya
okay can I will share to you
that's why and I feel bad for using fast fashion but is what I can afford so yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
okay
err I think

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber oh my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
oh my goodness then he was like uh then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself wah is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping oh my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling uh gacha for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn gacha so I can just earn back everything and pull more gacha
then another one they
he what ah he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market lah that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on gacha the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars lah at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
um what ah
uh I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like uh an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no uh fifty thousand yen in is
okay lah six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money lah but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like huh that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot sia is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay lah my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd lah I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what ah
uh shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that one wah that one is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because eh he quite handsome and his power quite cool
ah I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey kong and he has never failed to turn up with every single eh this company lah this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver ah I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey kong in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on gacha he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey kong's the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title oh I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
ah uh did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that lah
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
oh ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before changsub enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing ah so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
huh serious
alhamdulillah I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing lah but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
oh
oh serious
mmhmm
I can I I remember but I cannot remember ashraf
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is ah boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically lah but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
huh
heartbreak
oh
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
uh what's the one that the Ghibli one
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious ah
bestnya
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying oh my god
when was that before the after war
suay
wah that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
ah okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
hiroshima
karma
wah I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how oh all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
huh
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow ah
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares what you will literally like stare like nobody's business
oh speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian aceh is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one lah
that's true
huh serious ah
then they said like
uh when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
ugh
ugh
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then uh for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot eh my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know lah it's just okay lah granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever lah it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please lah if they
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not shahira is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really lah she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
oh
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
ugh
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
bestnya
I also want to go overseas study
ugh my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go uh university exchange because look at rifqi he's still so close with his two friends like eh I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
wah
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december eh
and this sem okay lah given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast

ya that's why she changed her mind lah so she did it at home
singapore flyer
really
she's only doing it cause her mother and father there
I think if I ever do get married
I want like I don't want a big wedding either but
let's say let's say hypothetically speaking ah
there is no way in hell that man will want a small wedding
ya because he has people like
overseas it's not just people here leh
really man my ex wanted a fucking big wedding sia and I'm like
I don't understand how some girls can have like twelve bridesmaids

I think so ah you know when I went to phuket right then I wanted to go snorkeling very badly because I really like the sea I love the beach I love the sea I like being in water but cannot swim for nuts I can only swim if my feet can touch the ground serious then we went to I went to phuket right with my ex ah then
we book all snorkeling trip know going to island island hopping right so we went to like maya bay and all that then the first island was in the middle of the freaking sea leh
cry lah damn sad sia then andre tried to teach me swimming in his pool
I cannot take it why do you have hiccups now
are we allowed to like pause the recording
probably
eh I want to henna dye my brows also leh
I lazy sial want to draw
syed's gonna what
why
ya
mm
he don't know how to find job is it
huh
oh
the irony
the freaking irony
panels
mm
I think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment eh where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
wah I'll be great and that sia andre sure sia will be good at that
he always he always huh
I don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever I stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night I won't see because I will be sleeping also
wah snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three by three he will wake up
mmhmm I always I always cannot sleep like
early when I'm alone
huh
I don't know when I mean when I was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like I don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
I don't know how but I will wake up to him cuddling it's either I wake to him cuddling or I wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
he doesn't I mean he will cook lah once in a while but lately we've been buying err he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six
I don't know how I don't know where he'd
I don't know where he get the energy from sia he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause I always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because I will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon I'll come because you know I would not wake up in the morning
every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him lah whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
oh so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick ah just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know ah it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like oh he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making eh like it's pointless like I told andre because uh last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle lah so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me lah but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscious choices what anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be sia so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise ah
mm
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
syed better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar what and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself lah like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose lah but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve sia
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like oh um
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
mm same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there lah
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already what tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper joo chiat
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one what so I'm meeting at one
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts ah but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see ah I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you ah
he eat but he's still white
so like white people kan standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
oh my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one what I mean if you are near the area then ya lah if not it'll be very troublesome for you what
wow I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope ah out of curiosity
when is syed's birthday
january what
oh my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini lah but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs what your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
wah
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them one know in like the last message I got was that ah oh it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
hmm
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
aiyo
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out
my some of my underwear is there

wow
siala
young marriages eh
the first thing is the first thing in my mind is just divorce ya
oof
like child before marriage
mm
foolish this tough man like
okay wow wait I need to like plan this out like I need to do
okay young marriages eh okay I think
something like that ya is like you know err like people said you are so young like you know like obviously people judge right
but then is like you can ya we are married you know we are not dong anything wrong we are not ya they are not doing anything wrong what they are not doing anything wrong
divorce
oof
okay
okay
okay
okay
they want to get married like what by by by two years time in a year's time
but they
I think like getting married and having a family is two different things
ya so what are you what do you have in mind getting married or building up a family
then
at least like whatever you do right like people can't really like judge you that much because like you're not doing anything wrong ya you're not giving a bad image you're just young
you just look young
ya
ya
and I I I have a children that means we're not married ya
oof that is like
time eh I don't think
I don't know I don't
she again she started to you know go err around
and the fact that she told me at I was what eighteen at that point I was eighteen at that point she was twenty six then I was like wah
but ya
and I think she just started like schooling like eh no not I mean working at that school like maybe about one year or two years around that ya around that
tie tie want to tie tie a knot
ya babe but that's you ah like everyone is different also what
okay to me I would say like
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot or not
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot
ah
mm
what ya money wise but go back to that question that you said in papers you can be managed with through papers what then after that then you can build up your life what financially
why
mmhmm
mm
they just sign papers they just get married they think like they're the one you know like each other soul mates sign then
mm
ya
for generation I think like I think it depends on the society ah
so it's like
yes correct workaholics that's the word
mm
mm
mm
mm
that that's what I feel because of like where we live the society that we live in that like that's how we live that's how it is
that's how we grew up like we need money if no money we die
ya
honestly I I don't think singapore only ah I think it's just right now everywhere okay fine maybe
we say singapore because we are asian
wait we're not talking about ang moh countries
correct
cause ang moh I don't think ang moh like oh ang moh is like oh time is everything more but they don't care about money they they they care more for time but the thing is

ya so how am I suppose to work
bullshit for for them to want ask to work two jobs
ya
ah
like but our minister said can
the court minister say can
ya
if like that means right is like okay I'm working for full time and then my side business let's say
bake cookies ah let's say ah ah home based ah
side business is bake cookies okay what is so do you consider that is a second job or is that just a like but then you said already said is really say side hustle
but also time and effort way to do that effort sia because you do that as a second job
so
so
what do is the good I don't see any good in working into two jobs more income I don't think so
I don't eh I don't really think that sia serious
okay ah let's say you work five days a week okay you work office hours then you have second jobs maybe let's say a part time ah ya part time second job second job is a part time
then maybe you need to work four days a week
then you have to commit one weekend so so in a way actually you are working six days a week less time for your family also sia
I mean obviously no family no problem ah if you have a what
for you
because okay I ask you time or money
mm mm ya
no no no right now money
so they're chasing after money what
ya best choice but like you said forty fifty plus not lonely ah
eh
ya let's say only singapore lah because where else
where else ah
mm
mm
and the fact that singapore don't show the suicidal rates

and and and the entire kitchen is covered with hello kitty right
are you gonna get mad
but it is not it's not going to look I mean is not those quirky quirky type you know
it's like it it is not those that if you look at it is very cringey
it it is those aesthetically pleasing
no that's quirky this is not nice
ya because they say is is too is too too
like too too much prints
like
uh
no I'm just asking asking you first like for your opinion like if it's okay
how
uh huh
why
why
what do you mean
like
like what
no
no
no
okay you you you talk
you talk first it's not that you talk first
I felt rational for that
so you can say you can tell me your plans first
no no no no no no no no no no
faster
I mean ya lah that's fine lah that's not part of furnitures
I know I know
I know you tell your mum that our future house is gonna be a zoo
because your mum asked me about it
she said
it she asked me if it's true if I know that you are going to make our future house look like the zoo
and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal
why
but why chickens are not legal
but I see some people have some people have chicken you know
no you can have cats in just as long as they don't they are not terrorizing our neighbours
ya
ah ya lah
so
okay
but why are people asking us to adopt chickens
but I think that one is really now illegal
I think that one is really now very much illegal compared to chicken
I I want a lovebird
but
you wanna be a turtle breeder
I don't think any but I I think not I think I don't think anybody wants to keep turtles for a long time
because they take up a lot of space
they really take up a lot of space
yes
yes can you give me awhile I want turn off the aircon
yes
because
I'm recording
ya I'm recording what
but it is very cold
I don't know I tell you I don't have the remote
but I think is the lowest
yes but I think it's the lowest
I mean like
ya I've never like changed the temperature
before so ya
eighteen
hmm
sometimes
must put air at home
yes
no
no
no
no
no
where
me see
I cannot see
no
oh oh oh oh oh I can see I can see
ya
what
correct
you are working today
huh
again
until what time
until
four fifteen
at where
do you earn a lot
how much
oh
not bad
not bad
ya
but but what
why you never do the that like like that time you do the afternoon
oh
oh
ya nevermind lah at least as long as like there's money coming in you know
so are you going to sleep after this
after this are you going to sleep
hmm
hmm
you know hanis never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me eh
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want lah
too lazy to talk to her
hais
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how rina always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from sonya that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know hanisah
they have leadership this leadership program lah basically but like
um sofia and rina said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked hanisah how long are you bonded with the school lah and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her ah because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her lah the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in you know seven years more in and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only ah ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand ah like twenty two thousand I can understand lah but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already lah anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true what like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her lah I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with sufian and rina what like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare lah she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense what
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand eh
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know lah
I don't know at first she didn't tell me lah today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know lah is it
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say ah who knows rina she say this you know who knows rina have something planned for me like dude
even if rina has something planned for you rina is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different eh in and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss saba
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents ah but we don't want to show the footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the lah what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see lah and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like lah and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know ah
and okay okay ya

right I can get money why not can put inside my savings
since I touch my saving I touch my savings
what
what
what
say

uh ah
I think
work from home
so everything is at home so
that's why lah I decided to actually go out to eat
oh I didn't know it's only twenty minute
cause I would think that it's like two hours
muay thai
is not going to be there all the time kan
wow
orh
it's very tiring lah
this is during my secondary school time
I quit choir
to join badminton
and then I was in the girl's team
ya and then um
I join competition
but do you that um I only
I didn't actually fight with anyone like you know be in a match
and I already secured myself second place
ya exactly
err hmm apparently it's possible lah
whoa
that's a very
defined goal
in your life
stand
one other days in this one is like what everyday
like do this
everyday or like just certain days
no it's not two K it's very little actually I think it's because
the funny part is kan
when I search for jobs they actually want
people with experiences even though it's a
let's let's say it's a intern job
the intern job also they want experiences I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find
a starting job to get all these experiences
in a good company
actually
what I look for in a job kan it's not just financial stability
but more of like
I want to be in a in a company that
err that actually appreciates you for what you do
nowadays
especially in start ups
they
just literally
if this
job or experience is worth it because you are doing bits and pieces of everything
that's why I like I'm finding a job that actually
values
like
their employees ah that's very hard for me to find
my god
can I say something
so kan
err I was hired
and I have
um like a
specialist diploma
err diploma girl
her job scope changed her from doing graphic design to digital marketing and you know what's worse
she is the head of my team you know when she is younger
and no experience and I've been in that company for six months
so I feel like shit you know like honestly because
like I have the qualities like honestly I'm doing really well like
teach the marketing
how to even do like a video thing you know like I cannot lah
and she's not hired for it but
she's getting paid more you know like I'm getting way lesser and she's
I don't know it's it's damn weird
she's twenty
ya
yes
that's true
let's let's not talk about this topic lah let's just uh move on because like I find
this type of uh topic kan like
it will never end
so what do you do now
like
what's your job scope
wait
so
you
telling me that
they don't really get
and then
like
while you're eating all these
how are they going to interact and then like
build on the social aspect
because I think the student care is there is to like
also like help them
not just academically lah
but more of like
mingling around with others
then if they can't do that then what will you do
this is going on
ya lah
so I guess they're trying to mould them into
being this type of
perfect person
but
because
ya like I said
how is
that gonna help them in a long run because
you will totally be affected by this and traumatised maybe
you know send me to student care
ya
you know
so
ah lah
my job scope
no lah just do bits and pieces of everything
ya lah
so
yesterday
wah
like she's having a lot of fun jer
very sweet lah I find
ya
actually
like
this christmas kan
anniversary
like literally on christmas
because ya he
he like
ask me out on christmas
like it's on a christmas
a bit a bit weird lah like
anniversary
orh
orh
we every month actually
celebrate the
like we literally go all out like we go eat expensive food
ya
huh
that is horrible actually
okay lah my boyfriend
okay okay jer lah
I think he's sweet
clingy
is the word for it
I think I'm the type
who
likes being clingy but I also have
to have the time alone
like to
to just get the energy back
I'm I'm
too used back then lah to be alone like being with friends
so when I was with him
when he was clingy I feel like
I'm being controlled
ya
ya that's true
I mean like
hopefully
ya
I agree with that everyone has their own timeline
so
like
how is
you and your family
actually
being the
eldest
you want to know why
they really like instill this list of
a list of responsibilities that I have to follow
then
like
they always me you have to lead
so like everything lah like academically wise
so that my brothers can
like follow the right path
ya and then my
brother's just came out
like
ya
and
like
ya it's it's
different lah like you can see
like as the years goes by my parents don't really care
about like
academic
like not as
how it used to be for me
wow
um you have to take
the scolding
like
just take it with a pinch of salt
like you are who you are so
ah
so sweet
uh huh
a sign lah actual
um
ya but then he ended up passing away
ya when I was young
so I think what you can do kan is
ah
mm
aduh
salad jer
the nutrition
nutrition site
is not there
then how are you going to make sure like the money that you spend on is worth
especially if you buy a lot at one go
ya
I think
it's a lot of work
like there's so many things you cannot juggle at one time
and for those who cannot multitask or or like
plan the days where a weeks well
confirm will have a hard time coping
I don't know anything about the twenty two curse
but then
I feel like
everything
it's not free lah
in the end
you have to work hard for it even if it's
small little things
even like let's say happiness within family
you have to work hard
to put in time effort even money
like sometimes I feel to have the happiness in family can have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family so really balance everything
sometime I feel
to have the happiness in family kan you have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family
so
really balance is everything
huh
bus stop
don't want to take responsible for him
that is
really cruel
but I think like
there must be some problems within the family
like rooted deep inside their family in order for this to happen
how you treat your parents is how you're teaching your your kids to treat you
I find that very
like
like when we grow old
like you know because my mum's
mother
so with my grandma on my mum side
I kind of
that we won't even know
so nowadays I've been trying to like
just some simple talks
and she's
she refuse to stay at home
like she's
she has
has she has been going out
like
literally like working studying all these kind of stuff
she's too used to walking out
so like
then she
because of corona then like
the
so she
like weekday she don't actually
but then she still go out
what the heck
like
your leg
actually I
seventy to eighty
around
eh I don't know how old
which ah
ya yes
ya she
like
you work your whole entire life
you know
and like not like
for her
I think um
then
scenery
you
you know what's funny
even
I find
like you know those bricks
I will take photos of those bricks
an err we like whoa
like I don't know I I think like
very simple
like
I don't even like
tea is not my thing
but then I I
keep thinking about it's like
oh ya the ferris wheel the houses
there's something that is
calling out to me
true lah
that's true
now that
economy
depends on them also
and I think
birth rate
we cannot do anything about it lah
I mean
I have seen
would this be something I would want
in the future
they look like
they're struggling
like
you look at these families
and then you like
they they really like
like
are they doing well
like
especially when you see them
in public
you wonder about their well being
is it weird that I think that way
but I think
you can see like they're
they're okay
like the kids are like happy and everything I think a a big happy family is
something
I would want in the future honestly
rely on
maid
I I think like
in the future right okay
the thing that is driving me to work hard kan
is that
I don't have in the future if I don't work work well
I can just get a maid
is that weird
like
so I've been living with a maid
so like if
I have that taken away from me
I don't know how to cook I don't how to clean
so if I have kids in the future
hopefully I can get into a university
I have been
financially
ya
ya
hopefully ah like
ya
actually I have
find all these like
but I do have a
plan in mind
maybe that's why I
you know took a break
I
I took like a one year break
before I start
working
you have to know
so
good thing that actually found something that I want to try out
in that area
ya
I also
that one year right
university
and then
I here waiting one more year to start on my degree
is that weird
that one year gap
like
put in effort to really go all out kan
I would have been so much happier
I do feel depressed when I think of it
and it makes me sad
I didn't know you took a one year break also
ya I thought you were studying or working
november jer pe you know
I
like literally
no
I bet you didn't know that
ya
my savings I used to have savings
yes
that's true
that's what I've been looking at
like to get my experiences and maybe use that as one of the factors to why they should
accept me to the university lah
wow
thank you
ya
that's the thing I don't know how to look at their courses
like I know what I want to do but I don't know like you know this
honours thing and then what minor
I hoping to get marketing
ya
ya lah
like
seriously
just because we have many experiences with different companies
like
okay like it also depends on the company they how they think
you have a lot of experiences
in that sense
you can help the company
the future company
in all these
areas
like maybe to improve you know
better
you know like I don't know like turn over rate
like lesser or something you know like
it's hard lah
to to know how does the hiring works
they are not okay with
is
categorised under job hoppers
so how are you supposed to be like a
graduate
with already experiences
like let's say they are looking for
did you see this advertisement job advertisement
they say they want someone in the twenties
but with like ten years of experience
ya that it was like going around in on the internet for awhile like
you expect to be like
ten plus like in your teens
and already start working or something
I have no idea
that's one of my wish
that's one of my wish lah in life like
I just want to have a job
that I'm happy to wake up to
I think
it's really hard to find
it's also depends on your mentality
how you have
like what's your outlook of life
which
is hard to change honestly
illegal
illegal movies I don't know lah no lah it's not illegal it's more of like they uploaded on internet let let's say I come upon to it you know
and then I'll be interested in it and then
you know I've I've watch all the
conjuring series
ya
no I don't
stranger things
it's good
like okay like in in my
in my
it's it's
they're kids
so they're cute
like
like what they do is like something we can
relate to
I think everything is nicer with someone else
it's okay you'll
god has
plans for you
confirm
I can see
I can foresee you being happy in the future lah
so
okay back
to stranger things
but
what
caught me caught my attention until like
at first okay I think they will start because of the hype
then you get the fun out of it because
you kind of have this friendship with them so like it's more of like
quit the game because
you have friends
to be there for you already
so like if you cut
the game out your life kan
you're cutting
ya
I
on my four
overcome
I
the younger one
youngest
invest
in a game
like like literally okay let's
you don't have to buy a four you can buy a switch
I think that's
the easier way that you save money
eventually if you were to play play nation all the time
the invest on
rely on dividends
actually I not so sure
okay lah

okay testing
okay lah can lah
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of um hitting the red waves
yeah
ah but it has to be that means twenty apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements ah
take this as a the centre marking ah
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like ah um what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that lah so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
but what what was the instructor's comments
mm
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money ah
it's the same bike
mm
E brake eh
oh okay okay ya ha ya it's there ah okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
mm
behind ah
oh okay
secluded ah
okay
um
of course lah
wait you went you you stop to help her
oh the instructor went to help her
ya lah I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
oh she
ya correct ya
mm
mm
what so she crashed into the wall
skid ah
by point of time you stop ah
mm
mmhmm
kill switch
mm mm mm mm mm
oh you get you got number one ah
mm
bandana
mm
mm
the other side ah
then
mm mm
mm mm
but he was in charge of your class ah
prac one also lah
oh okay
hmm
no lah maybe maybe they they want you to practise more ah before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no lah some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay lah I mean with practice you can ah
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already ha
that's how fast a class two bike is ah
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly ah
highly harly can bobber ah you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive lah sia uh I I I tested the bike um
I think last year during uh
so when they they they open up their their booth
people lah so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred bike
whatever what you see is what you get lah
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
uh sanju
kaki bukit sanfu sanfu
uh and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven ah seventeen K
eh sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus ah
expensive ah
definitely way cheaper lah I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean uh zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike ah brixton
but of course lah mutt is mutt is
I mean way better lah
eh um if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
oh I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
uh brixton is is is a europe bike ah
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
um
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money ah
you upgrade
mm
ah lah of course lah of course lah
no lah I mean I'm looking at my options
why ah
ya but super four is uh quite reliable bike ah
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the of the bike
put a
mm
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive ah sial
my my bike one bottle that means one litre lah so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no lah one month ah I mean right now COVID one month ah
back then eh no lah back then when I was working in uh
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month ah to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need ah
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay lah harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay lah let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul uh ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs ah
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why lah I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice lah I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
mm
oh
ya lah and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper ah
no the furthest I went with this bike was um desaru
the furthest I went with my was uh muar
ya ya lah
um
tow ah
they will go for the
the dangerous way ah
this one I I never tried ah I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you ah
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
uh power to push together
ah
eh
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders ah
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or uh a new overhauled engine
um
you're not supposed to exceed a certain and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike lah
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral lah
speaking of bike accidents
uh my father's friend ah
dulu bapak aku pun kira mat mat motor juga ah
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died lah sia
so so
before this guy died ah he told me lah then he was very different
eh you know forgive me ah if I ever sinned towards you ah
so on that day they went to
but same case ah he went under the truck
it's dangerous ah
oh speaking of dangerous riding kan I think one of their simulation lessons kan
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid ah sial
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can ah but then it's stupid ah
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike ah
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike ah no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
huh
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the kerb sia
that is far sia
mm
ya ya
huh
huh serious ah
oh the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting ah
he went home ah
it means quite quite bad lah
old guy ah
but big size ah
hazriq size ah
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike ah
I see that bike ah
alamak
what the guy is small or big
why sia why would he buy such a bike
no lah I mean if you scared I mean don't ride ah
maybe ah
but if you talk about those small bike ah
those those similar those kind of bikes ah
um there's this bike it's called uh honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike ah he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days lah which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know ah
mm
go back to office ah
so you're gonna take you bikes ah
stupid eh
huh
you can book everyday
legit ah
oh
if got two days later
mm
mm
then you exceeded the line ah
oh exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue ah
that was your last ah
assessment
fail ah
mm
mm mm
oh
mm
if there is a car you need to stop ah
ah
serious
mm
mm
bike instructor
ah serious ah
what if you hit into a car
who is the huh then the the damage all cover is it

mm mm mm mm mm ya ya ya and like proving them wrong because you can actually buy it
okay but if you let's say you have some money we will get back to that point point that so you enter what chanel you enter chanel and then people judgy right but you want to buy some things because you want to eliminate this judge right
in order for you to buy something

hospitals
oh that's true
oh that's technically a pay cut lah right
ya ya I mean

shout out shout out frontliners
um and I really I don't know what I don't know if I
okay do you okay you've known me for like what a a year a year plus do you think I can be a good nurse

ya like we have a friend
who like err
who've seen like
like things lah
on the roadsides and I don't know I don't know if I see it would I faint instantly
mm it's okay
ya
so
maybe
a lot of nurses I know they are earning quite well sia
you
like
err
not I mean err it is a medical school right but I don't think it's like that medical school where they need ten years or I don't know is it ten years
to be a doctor

like technically
doctorate
oh okay
okay okay doctor
fazil doctor fazil
okay

okay so when somebody is like my my general what's it general doctor ah
like the general practitioner
and then um he so he has the doctor to his name right
do you because I thought all along that you have to know medical stuff
to be called doctor but then there are a lot of doctors out there

a doctorate in other things ya
ya isn't medical

kan
funnest is not a word singlish
ah
okay okay
oh okay eh what's the opposite of capitalism ah
is it communist no right I don't know no that's democracy
okay lah
mm
you know what's the punch line in all these like I don't know a lot of shit right eh sorry a lot of things but
I
ya I'm sorry this is like we are tone down a lot like ya so um
but I said I started the dictionary
so I I think people immediately feel like that is such a lie you don't even know ah thanks no I didn't I didn't because that's a joke like I thought I would file that joke but
oh well
manipulation I I appreciate my friends that
can take my joke wait is that is that your checklist your friends have to be able to take your jokes

uh huh
uh huh
mm okay okay okay
wah
we will go
oh okay
oh okay okay
cleaner ah
oh okay okay
mm
just just to get the ah
aduh
aduh
a'ah
mm
eh
oh okay okay
oh okay
ah okay
mm
kan
chey
mm
right
ah
correct
okay okay but wait ah but from what I know covalent is ah they they are not they didn't pass the right
mm
ya ya level nine what happened to that ah
ya ya
ya
but their their proposal is it legit or not
ah covalent
can be done ah
oh confirm lye can ah
I tell you confirm can ah
should be able able to ah
they they they should be able to do what they should be able to do right
I know rin joo I think they are they are not keen to have us already ah ever since
but then rin joo already stated that they are not going to quote for the job right
in the email if I remember it correctly yes they say like that ah
back to covalent eh
ya I I'm a fan of blackpink
but some say ah that they are using plastic surgery
yes
yes
risky lah
I don't know you can try ah
can see
but back to covalent how are you going to ah
ah
is it the meter or what
victoria is aware about this lah
ah yes correct
but has everything been assigned or not
okay but within the flat the the facade what because they going to pour right
the ya the cement
wait so so
platform ah
ah okay okay
but why is she so technical ah what what what what why is she so concerned about all this
okay
correct
ya
dah confirm ah
highland out already ah
tell me about the cash flow issue ah
no no ah yesterday you told me
mm
the guy the guy
the malay guy who I call
but but but have they already got ah their Q Q Q to check the the the line or not
mm
oh the ladder the loose ladder ah
see again
ah I think I think I just wanna wish you all the best
that one that one consider fair ah
oh
so after that you go grade yourself and then ah
and then when you grade when you grade for higher higher grading eh
this is what I heard from ah from harries ah he told me that if you grade yourself high ah then management will think that you have no room for improvement so ah management will actually move down to lower lower
chey

mmhmm
what do you mean by not progressing
actually um
so like I want to make use of it
even though um the
the idea that no longer having money is kind of like scaring me a bit ah cause like
I don't know eh
mm
cause like honestly nowadays
started business
like microbusiness right solely because of
sometimes in your head you think you can do better
or like you can come up with something better cause nowadays
not saying that I have a lot of skills or what but then like ya it's just
something I sort of feel like ya
I saw
err
so like it's I feel like she shouldn't price it so high cause I have a feeling that's the same probably the same process
um
when I saw the TikTok I think it's
in a way it is err embroidery in a machine but then like I think maybe
she just has to like either type out the name or like design it a bit ya
actually I think there's a okay maybe there is a bit of difference
like
I think we both follow the same
I think we do lah we do follow the same account so whatever accounts we follow is
is is unique in their own way I like maybe like
ah necklaces or like earrings
oh ya ya ya
ya ya oh my god ya
mm
and by right I think actually if you cannot also you can actually
can glue right
but it's just it won't last long
is either they have to give up their style or they have to um
not give up but maybe like either alter themselves or like
ya
actually ya now that you mention it I I actually don't know how like how did
the like entire universe decide
that oh this would be this makes an S this makes an M this makes and L this makes and like
how because like I can
nots I mean I'm not really I would probably say that I am considered average
eh average lah ya and then like
don't have M L I don't know if they have M L but ya it's like that
mm mm so like I'm like
like what if like you on the
cause like it's not that it's not that thin like not really that hugging but then it's not exactly
I don't understand
orh
your bust
speaking of like
what's that call uh sustainable is it call sustainable fashion
ya sustainable fashion and thrifting and all that honestly
um I think people confuse that and thrift that and vintage a lot
and I really feel like people should educate themselves because
there's a difference and
I don't know how to I don't even know how to explain the difference cause like
but like you know how um
and not not to name any but Loop Garms and um
cause that time um actually
my boyfriend actually ask uh ask me uh send me this post by Loop Garms
ah chris chris jericho ya chris jericho the shirt
then ah he like he like it ah cause he really like ah
like he was saying like he likes it ah then like he's
he's too shy to ask so even though he he is like to be honest when I
but but I mean like I guess
some people might take that as
I don't know if they considered if people do consider Loop Garms or stuff like that
or whatever shop similar to that um as thrifting
is just like another man's
trash that you consider to be treasure you know what I mean right correct right ya
people see it as an investment
I mean there's still a lot of fans it's just that maybe like
I don't know like only certain people will still be able to see the value in it like
cause there will there will always be like this
ya but also like there'll always be this resurrection of
of people who suddenly fall in love with vintage and like
really want to like spot
so ya
ah
the whole oh okay
so cute
honestly I think
like you know you your comment about the fashion in in general the fashion industry I think
I think people I mean obviously we're trying
more lah like this I think
this generation is more aware and like willing to like
make certain changes but honestly it's been like years of
is
is been years of like um
it just it just happen we suddenly like care about it I guess or like we're less ignorant
like more aware of what we're using and what we're wearing and like whatever we're consuming also now we're more
um
I don't know we're just more conscious yes that's the word conscious
honestly it's ironic that
that the thing that was meant to um reduce um
I mean honestly I don't even understand how
that uh I mean I understand how it happened but also don't understand cause like obviously at the root
it's just that like other humans and like us like just
that and just I think we are just wasteful people
entitled I guess a part of it is entitled and also
ya era era ya so
um I think we just
too
everything is too convenient now
like we don't really see the value in that in that thing we don't really see like
uh how much was like
put into like making it
and stuff like that
honestly uh
what we talking about
okay I don't know how we got to this I think cause we started talking about sustainable fashion ya
but ya I think you know how you ask me like
I think maybe
for now you just try to
um I think that one once you done I guess you can
cause you sold it to her at a reasonable price uh honestly
I I also don't I mean is it she make her own tote bag or what like no no no I meant the tote bag itself you know the
she made herself
oh
okay but but I think mm
pricey lah in my opinion is not that pricey cause you set how much you want to pay
no as in I meant the promotion you know how you told me about that advertisement and all that ya all those ads
you set how long it was so like you can actually just have it for one day for like seven days
or like one month also can then you can also choose how much you want to
how much you want to pay
how much you want to pay per day so it can be like
five dollars six dollars seven dollars per day also can actually
ah cause
you can choose you you like I said you can choose how much do you want to pay per day also right then you can also like
choose who you aiming for cause you can choose like
uh
if I'm not wrong you can choose like based on interest so you can choose like crochet shopping and
bags fashion whatever lah like you can you can put that
under the interest so that you will so that the ads are targeted to the correct person
ah by right I think that it can
I think your posts can end up on there
overseas
ya
oh ya ya ya
you know the account gosh girl
ya I love
upcycle
orh
should we order together
lah
ya I know
but actually I kind of like those type of stores I kind of want to do something like that
honestly I think for honestly now that I think about it right if uh if I were
you or if like I have the
resources and I have the energy and the
motivation to do it myself I might actually
will you be interested then you see lah how many people would and all that like if it's a really popular design you should
probably consider bringing it back or something like that
ya cause like I think that's
that should be the goal of any
shop I guess cause like
cannot come up with anything new
a few back up or like a few
a few designs that you really
like know you can do it and then like it's not that complicated but it's still nice or stuff like that
so I don't know ah
honestly right ya
yes I can see that
actually I think
I mean honestly it's smart lah and also and also
you post about it like once on her story
you know what I mean and that's still a lot what
anyway the designs also so cute seh
will it last if there's no lining
actually I love uh that some some
so I think it's cute but ya
ya
I mean we're not encouraged to follow it even
honestly um
err
I really think I love the baggy look a lot then like I don't know ah I just want to do something creative not that I've the free time
but everytime I have free time
I don't understand why like I already have free time what I don't know why I'm not using it you know then like
I'm actually still thinking about it
but ya so like I actually kind of
to me it's not really that complicated
you know accounting actually I think
realise it's an important skill
because even though account accounting is kind of a
just a bit boring to me but then um
because um
okay uh
okay so I I took when I was in like secondary ya it was in secondary I didn't do well lah honestly but
but I still understand what it is lah
financial statement or whatever okay no ah
like
took my score because it was a bit low ya but but honestly
is not
it's not dreadful but then
it's honestly just very is desk job lah but you
ya
ya mm
um industries that will be fine in a
in this situation is banking accounting food
food obviously lah cause
maybe
ah yes education and then
ah ya delivery like
ya lah just logistics maybe and stuff like that like
but arts will always be affected
ya
is it wild rice or is it singapore repertory theatre
they have ah I think they holding a performance I don't know
really
I got the email for it mm
I was like do I why did I subscribe to
mm
hotel orh it's a production
is it popular or what
boring
boring jer
like I can't make you a man or whatever what's that line ah
something you are not ah okay yes
I think it is because like because
yes
it instead of it being like a
oh I'm really going to
put in like minorities in my show cause they deserve to be the main character
versus like oh I'm just going to cast this
like just to be there so that people don't say it's completely white or just completely
certain race or whatever I don't know
ah ya ya ya ya
jameela
ah yes yes yes
tahani
yes
ya
ya
I know you trying to think of for a show where
I don't know ah like
yes because
but I have a feeling that some people
mm
mia khalifa
but
everyone in the world knows her and has obviously seen parts of her that I'll I feel like she would rather not
and she was also forced to do it also you know what I mean that's why I honestly sympathise with her on that lah
ya
it's not a lot lah actually but
I don't know ah
but
I mean ya lah
not all I will just say right now I just going to say right now even if I said all I don't mean all lah okay
but like not all but some
how do you think like that like how do you let yourself think like that cause I can look at a guy
and like I won't think like that you know what I mean
I I mean
I mean like I guess I get okay I understand
not trying to be like
fight back you know what I mean
like we are have always been perceived as
ah yes like weaker we like not the stronger um

seven six five four three

no serious okay maybe I'm not as bad as some people
you know her kan ya you know her she tried cooking
no and then you know her mum was like hospitalised for a week
serious
because
kita sebagai orang islam kan kita semua terrorist tu semua you know
ya even though I hate doing laundry so heavy but ya and then like uh you know in malaysia the the women's army actually wears hijab
ya
which I don't want to do lah I mean I don't know about you but just walking ten minutes in hijab is enough to make me sweat and imagine having to exercise in hijab wah I did that in year one because okay in my school we have this um thing where all year ones have to do sports it's called sports for life
so err I was in what was it called squash oh my god I love squash it's like tennis but you just hit the ball against the wall and you can actually go blind for it ya but then the thing is kan um
I I was wearing I was already wearing a hijab lah in year one and then dude the warm up exercise consist of us running around doing push-ups squats and all that
I felt like dying it was so hot cause like not only was I wearing a hijab so not only was my head and my neck covered up but I also had to wear the sleeve and then so inside I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and then outside I was wearing the sports for life uniform and then I was wearing socks and all that wah dude it was like
it wah I felt like I was dying in the desert sia serious
that was how hot it was and there was only two fans in the court and then I wasn't even there was so many of us so I wasn't even anywhere near the fan I don't even know how I survived that I should have just joined yoga or something
no lah cause actually the reason why I joined sports kan was cause uh it was super cool to me like can you imagine playing tennis or whatever against the wall you don't have to worry about looking at other people in the eyes but then uh I found out that usually squash like in pairs kan
you have to be careful cause you can actually hit your partner with the racket and then like um you have to wear the face face gear or something cause sometimes um the ball will hit against you like when it bounce against the wall kan
then like uh then my my coach was like scaring us about how this player he didn't pay attention to where the ball was going then it hit him in the eye then he turned blind then I was like shit why did I even join this no that and
one of my crush was actually in squash
ya so so like when I found out that he was in squash I was like oh my god we can play squash together so I joined lah but then we ended up being in different groups
so
and now he's with an older lady
so
kan kan I mean I don't remember but I think his new girlfriend is quite hot I guess so I guess I can see why he wanted to be with her but still like dude ugh
oh my god you know speaking of men I have one month like by the end of this month to find a guy
because
you remember diana
he is I think he's four to five years older than us he is working at this um company so um usually he'll be at tuas checkpoint cause uh his company is collaborating with the checkpoint for this new facial scanner
thing
ya so but but her boyfriend is a bit her boyfriend is like you know ahmad remember ahmad
kan
on that very friday and it wasn't even that he started early tau he started at like eleven plus and then he was supposed to submit by err four o'clock or was it five o'clock and you know when he promised to meet her
no two o'clock
so she's she was waiting for him no wait he was supposed to meet her at twelve o'clock but then she was waiting for him from twelve until two
kan like okay
I respect everyone's beliefs
I have friends who are atheist I have friends who are non-believers I have friends who are buddhist my family has christians and taoist and all that like my family is a mash of like different religions
oh ya
okay so uh it was last week I think when I met her and then she she tried she and her boyfriend tried to set me up with her boyfriend's friend he's not handsome
I got I got
I'll show you later um I have way too many pictures in my phone
ya I'll I'll just send it to you tonight or something once I find it wah I need to delete a lot of pictures from my phone but but anyways
you know me uh but the the thing is kan so ya lah but I have a bit of a high standard when it comes to guys than their looks it's not just the personality you know and and the thing is do you know how he like so um I told diana and her boyfriend that uh I'm not interested in him like cause I once I saw the picture I was like
oh hell no bitch I'm sorry
so I said just give my tele cause I don't post my pictures or anything over there pe
so ya you know what was the first message he sent me
hey there golden child
kan so so I sent him this message lah like um my first and my first and last message to him I said hi um you can call me D uh ya err I don't even know why our friends like to set us up but I already told them that err we don't really we're I'm not really interested in you like as more than as friends lah so um you don't have to pay attention to them or anything and um
like
ya
I don't want to cause
so she's giving me until the end of the month to find a guy or else she's going to like do her best to set us up and I don't want that
ya when I find ya ya oh my god dude

like okay doing sports with my friends is okay but then doing sports with that guy and her boyfriend and and all his friends bruh I haven't even met your boyfriend and I'm not going to be match up with that guy
and ya I haven't replied to her oh my god what should I do what should I do what should I
err I'm gonna tell her that oh err I have some family matters to attend to
but I can't hold that off forever
oh my god what should I do do you have any suggestion I need to find a guy I need I need someone to help me
oh should I just pretend to be a lesbian but no that's not believable
I tried that once actually people actually believed it
ya
but that's cause they don't really know me that well
actually you know um in poly kan back in poly I was asked out a couple of times by girls
ya apparently I give off a lesbian vibe
and then there was this girl who was
so into me she actually stalked me home serious serious I was so scared so everytime I want to go home my friends have to send me home cause she she would like take picture then she was like[eh oh my god we are in the train and and and I don't even know where she live at but I know it's nowhere near me
and you know what's the worst part
kan
and you know what's the weirdest part
eh hi we are on the same train again this morning like
bruh where did you even come from
ya I told her like oh um um I mean indirectly lah cause she was my quite close friends
ya
chi hao
but she never really got the hint
so until that project ah that project was when she got angry with me cause um I told her cause during the entire period she didn't do anything
ya
and then I was like oh okay we weren't even friends like she was in my course but she was from a different class
ya so I was like oh
okay girl I have seen but never talk to before and then oh my god there was another girl actually um so there's this there's this module called gen ed general education do you have it
and then kan we were roommates so like um okay this is going to get a bit explicit
mm
dude you know first day kan she just started stripping in front of me then she said oh I'm going to shower you can you can you can watch if you want
then I was like
so she met this uni guy over there and he look like her boyfriend
so she spend most of the time with him in his room
ya so um
ya at first
and then she said
end game
was he cute though
okay never mind
okay ah
oh my god I really want to see how he looks like
oh my gosh you know kan speaking of guys do you remember ateeb
he's still texting me now
ya okay
so the story of ateeb is a long one started back in sec one so in sec one um he confessed to me cause we were in the same clique
ateeb me jonathan zi qing and justin
there was this K-pop song that uses one four three means ya ya
ya so I wasn't interested in ateeb at all so err I told him like oh sorry man like you are a great friend and all but I don't think I can see you as anything more than a friend and then he he started spamming me so I just muted him like I felt bad for blocking him and we were in the same class and same clique
he spam
zi qing cause at that time zi qing was my best friend
cause like
ya he was spamming everyone and then uh afterwards I okay don't tell anyone okay
but I actually
had a crush on justin
no no serious I and and I don't know lah was I so excited when whenever I text him lah
and then he even asked me out but then apparently he like zi qing
so um at that time I had a crush on a senior then the senior made fun of me then I um tala found out you know you remember tala
ya so tala uh tala heard about it then tala was like eh D how can you go and confess to someone else when you are dating ateeb
and then but but apparently a lot of people really believe that I was dating ateeb dude that was the reason why none of my crushes accepted me because they thought I was dating ateeb and I was like two-timing
he um he saw me with my one of my friend her name is phyllis then he said eh phyllis damn cute sia can you intro me to her then I was like um I don't mind lah but as long as she accepts you then then and only then will I intro you to her
so err I ask
him to give me a his best picture then
ya so he sent me a picture uh if I can find the picture I'll send it to you then I showed it to her I showed it to all my friends like asking like eh if anyone's interested in this guy he's super rich
he's he's super rich yeah that's the only good part about him
ya and then after that mm err phyllis was like everyone actually they said that oh he looks quite cute from afar until they zoomed into his picture and his face then they're like
oh actually on second thought maybe not it was harsh but it was true I mean like would you date ateeb
you know what happened he found her account on tinder like she wasn't using it at that time lah cause she was dating someone else but then um afterwards
she she saw him and was like eh I know this guy so she just cause like she remembered him as my friend so she just match with him ah
then he started spamming her asking her to date him begging her to date him then she was like no no no no and she keep on saying no then after that she she got annoyed lah so she blocked him on tinder you know what did he did
no he went to my friends list he found her account he added her he her and then she she thought that at that time um phyllis and I were in the same clique so she thought that I was the one who gave him her account
then because of that right she got angry with me wah he he ruined a lot of potential for me man then after that he he spam her her her ah begging her to date him and all that then she block him also then afterwards um we weren't friends anymore like phyllis and me cause of him lah
and then he and then we just stopped talking and then in year two he texted me again like um it was a snapchat then I was like you know snap streaks were like super popular right then so I was like okay ah never mind it's just for snap streaks only what so I was like streaking with him
then like what makes you think that any girl would want you you know he he confessed to huda also
ya but huda rejected him also
dude I know I'm desperate but I'm not that desperate as to like know accept your money and then like date you you are not even sugar daddy material man
he was the one who led himself on
so in
kan maritime is like one end
no I I saw because they have a uniform pe
so I saw the uniform from afar then I I I was so scared cause like for a few days kan I keep on seeing like students from his school all of a sudden keep on coming to my school so I thought it was him then then err everytime I want to go anyway my friends will accompany me
ya and then he was in america like the ship was going around pe then his last stop was at america so he had to get back to singapore himself
then at that time it was already like period like cause we end on february fourteen then it was already like
anyone ya anyone who came back
had to be quarantined pe so he was quarantined at a hotel
I already told you all my friends don't even like you you are not even their type no no matter how rich you are your personality and your looks aren't worth it bro
uh ya but I I didn't lah cause it was so funny to see what he was texting
he found my email
dude I don't even know how he found my email
that was years ago
ya
but that was what seven years ago
I thought I thought like seven years ago the emails would have been deleted already
so I just ignore then he emailed me like
he emailed me like on tuesday
I haven't open the email actually oh my gosh but ya
kan and then like um so I only told diana about this cause I never really get in touch with anyone else
I don't know man I mean oh my gosh I don't want to choose between ateeb or rudy that's so weird no no no no no oh my god I need a guy I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend but all my friends are busy
he's always been like that actually
ya but then during secondary school kan after I rejected him again he you remember crystal
ya so err what went on was that err ateeb ateeb confessed to her a lot of times then she always said yes yes yes but but everyone knew that she was only saying yes cause she was playing around with him
she didn't even like him
I had a crush on justin at that time also
then like couple kan
ya and then like with rayson I always talk anime with him oh my god I missed it and then at that at that time kan I really thought that I had a chance with justin tau then I found out he moved on from zi zi qing to zi ning
and then he was super into zi ning at that time then I was like oh so all this time you treated me like a girlfriend cause she wasn't there and ya so I'm just a rebound again

ya
okay ah chao
bye

eh how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so err intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic what two people ah and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also what right so I think you choose your job
which is good
mm yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
mm
yes
wah that's that's okay too kan
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course lah once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work lah for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though um
okay lah I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking wah I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating err calorie counting app lah I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it lah okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
oh
shoes I thought you like shoes
oh
eh but you will be more at the office part right
huh you have to also track just in case they need to run out
oh
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons lah but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily ah
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days oh okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job ah
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
err there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping one but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
oh okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay lah I mean I found some recipes online so err chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff lah so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
oh where's her workplace oh area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else ah yes can request ah
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with uh this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes lah all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
oh
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy lah to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
onigiri onigiri
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up oh just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
ah we wanted to eat sushi salmon mentaiko I think I'll just order that when we go to hei sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon mentaiko
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before lah the cuts I let you try before the say inadi with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and mentaiko torched
let's go eat that tomorrow oh that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one

okay so the topics that we will be talking today ah it's um firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
for me ah I like science lah so maybe ten years in the future kan I would want to have
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and ah whatever there is lah so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also uh ten years time probably um I would like to
uh I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
focus on my uh
my computing whatsoever lah
yes
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe uh so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so mm
uh you were in your future house
and then um maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
mm
mind is stimulated ah
uh more to like action thriller
uh okay for for me uh I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you uh in-hand situations about uh about issues that could surface in the future lah uh technology areas or
something to think about
ya and and make you like oh it helps me to
solve problems easily and uh see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode eh
the reason why she was trapped is because um
uh her her boss took a of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting lah how they plan to uh get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then ah sometimes he can ah turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself them them self were were were were shocked lah cause their was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end uh some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so uh he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and uh there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape lah so it was quite surprising interesting ah how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that eh hmm
if you can become an actor
uh what
hmm if you can become an actor eh and like any actor eh do you prefer uh do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
mm
I think I will
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is ah not getting cheaper these days
so I think uh focus on health and and intervening myself from any diseases ah correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
I think
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be um how can mental health be um what's that addressed
and how can be um
how can we uh better improve our mental health area general
uh projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
very rigorous very very broad and very
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
uh rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given ah should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity ah
uh off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system ah like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
um
um how many one point two grams of uh phosphorus is needed to make uh I don't know cyanide or something
you can think of how to uh not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
okay so uh moving on maybe let's talk about
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever ah where would you want to go
and why
ya
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
oh when you were a little child
work studies stress ah
we play
mm
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
uh memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
um shape you and how you are today
ah
probably mm
I I think I would want to go to
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby uh in the european universe or the western part of the world
ah there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but uh there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
um ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and ah people were killed and people were died from um
um unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
uh the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know sina ah al jazali
uh mariam
abu sayde or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam lah I think it's very interesting to see
inventing the clock invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
you ah
so apart from like
mm going back in time
um what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to uh have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to um to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal lah you particularly the elderly man take
the third one
ah
uh I think first lah I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
uh I wish
uh I wish that uh world hunger can be stopped lah cause
and they went in first world country
uh no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from uh camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad lah so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope ah nobody would go hungry lah in this world
and ah the second wish would be ah
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause uh we don't have the technology
because even from um the nearest got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
eh three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
metres kilometres kilometres
so um I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out um others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish uh actually uh I think I
I wish to have my own family one day inshallah
maybe next five ten years or so
really helps me to
uh have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me lah I really like to learn
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but um just hope to you know
um get married one day
okay so mm
so maybe uh cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
I eat right
I think uh I think
is not really essential lah but apparently
uh you want your friend or anything
how can I contribute better to the society
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
uh if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be uh be taught to the world
but um having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life lah
yup
respect
won't look down on you lah
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's um
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you lah that uh having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
flash
speed ah speed
inshallah
uh huh
I I like to teleport ah
ya
mmhmm
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
mmhmm
you know is is very easily easy lah I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like oh ah when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like um we have uh we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry um some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to um playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind lah that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
err is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation lah
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of do you think is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think uh uh this thing
trait between and humans probably uh they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have um
I think reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
uh some uh some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an to talk to would be like
uh for example labour like being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use to like weaponise or do something lah something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
um especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be um probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
uh like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it lah
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting ah to actually think about like imagine imagine will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from um human beings and like imagine they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many um so many notions so many ideas that can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
very interesting
uh huh

for lunch
so expensive
the delivery
newton eh
okay lah the feels to eat satay is there
what time is my breakfast
okay
mmhmm
eh eh
wah
no lah okay first few times he asked me
I mean I don't want to say his name lah
but ya
then like after that people keep asking me
like we exchanged stories lah and then turns out that he has been asking around
and then like he has never bought his own pack of cigarettes which is like weird
oh no
until a certain while we all stopped giving and then he like go to another group of people to ask like
like
and like the cheese is there
ya
um mostly like indian malay food lah know the the normal kind
woodlands eh
like
make you put on put on weight faster
okay
mm
satay eh
mm
oh
mm
google maps says that there is a bus
high eh
mm
wah
I don't think I can make it lah if I wanna go venture into that kind of industry
mm
straight ahead
okay so
turn left here and then we got to take the overhead bridge
ah okay I can see already I can see the lights from here
ah
mm mm
okay
mm
mm
the night is still young seh
you know that I have oversized shirts right
wah grabhitch eh
very lucky
ya grabhitch very rare you know people get grabhitch
I mean I feel like it depends on your luck what because like let's say the driver is going wherever you're going
and then the driver happens to be in the same area as you
then you will get it what
mm
ah okay lah
mm mm
wah
mm mm
mm
mm
az
people say
don't cry over spilled milk tau
for my birthday but then we cannot go bali right so I want to eat indonesian food
mm
okay lah that's like
soon in six days
but we need to
save some money for dinner lah if you want to plan for dinner
mm
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself lah in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
speak
mm
no okay do you even okay maybe you do lah but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
mm
mm
I think we grew up differently lah
ah
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
uh wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
eh wonder woman seh
that's the villain lah for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan seh to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
it's gonna be so
mm mm
money makes the world go round eh
ya lah
but
mm
uh maybe we do something different lah you know that they have this like
you know those uh escape rooms
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual reality
world ah through the eyes
ya anyways those uh virtual reality rooms ya we can consider doing that I think
I think it's about
forty five minutes ah
okay lah if you calculate it's like one minute one dollar
you have to accommodate to um all the group who you know that uh not all our friends like to LAN right
mm mm
but the future is bleak right now bro
that's why we are balanced
hais
eh
mm mm
and then my next pay probably is twenty twenty one
new year new me wah
um
ya
so
huh that's a I think this topic of like what to eat
it's like
a deep dark hole you know
because like
so much difficulties thinking about what to eat
what to eat nevermind you you need to think about whether you want to order in and then like there's the delivery fee and all that to consider
context of
having the difficulty to
choose what to eat
mmhmm
catching
mm
okay
so
ya
wah wah wah wah wah
ya lah because twenty dollars divide by six people
mm
too emotional sometimes
it's true
hmm
okay lah
I mean it's just like to some people
and
the booking for the staycation
wait so need to let them know lah tomorrow morning
no because we never talk about when to tell them
so we need to let them know tomorrow morning when we wake up on the way to work
eh just message the group lah we have a group
ah
wait is it
I was looking at the furnitures lah to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website lah bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
huh spend six hundred wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty lah
but okay that doesn't matter ah
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know lah maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the can be different lah
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
ah LUMOS aura projector
and then ah projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a or the projector
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
cause ya lah
ah adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
mmhmm
uh huh
kan I also had that concept
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky uh
ah the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
and then we still have spare
we can uh I mean
divide lah the money then I would probably wanna buy like a a new laptop
for school
mm mm
alhamduls
mm all the best for that
like that's the thing about humans lah
when you get extra
complain when you get shortage complain it's like our culture
hais
I would prefer to spend that money on food then on grab
ya lah
kan the first few music we won't be sleeping also
cause like we will get comfortable
what lah you don't want to watch like this
mm
so come come up with a new idea eh
munch nibble on something
it's cool
thick and juicy
a'ah
mm mm

hello hello
ideal vacation it would be
comfortable very casual very um spontaneous kind of ah trip I like that kind of ya I mean I I mean
for me it will be spring and when
I got a I got a
my cousin who went to korea before he said that ah it's super duper cold he went there during winter so so it's super duper cold so if you want to go there during winter better get prepared like
all the necessary staff for you to stay warm so I'm like ya it it's interesting ya for me but ya to your question it will be spring spring is my I think it'll be
tour guide in singapore I mean singapore got a lot of interesting and like places to go but if I were a tour guide I will bring them
it's very interesting question ah I'll bring them
to
uh oh my god
I say there's a lot of places but I can't think err err
oh ya okay maybe ya ya maybe if you want to
ah I remember you know the masjid sultan area what do you what what what area is that ah
ya okay I was I was thinking of what's
err kampung glam
five stones they have five stone ah they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade ah where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
from what I heard from my friends like I'm more to like the old side of of like I mean ya I'm that I I give that kind of vibe to them lah like I I really like oh like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very very fun and interesting for me ah
happy family you mean yes
oh I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of uh you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends um she suggested me this one at at that point of time of the year ah the title was boys over flowers
it brings me back so much lah like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like ah
they I mean they have a lot lah but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
oh I like
we watch the same thing ya ah kitchen nightmares
oh those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's ah go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like wah like wah you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
err how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say lah
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like ah
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
oh ya ya ya
movies
uh
oh movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one lah I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting what
eh it is so good I wish I wish uh I could you know get that that kind of uh if it was to exist in singapore lah or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you

how ah you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good what
oof cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag

ah
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
ya for me it will be err read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean ah you know
ah food it's always about food ah in the end it's always ah it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too lah what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
alright so how about ah
K got another question for you okay err
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya ah okay what is the one thing that you wish was free

that's true
mm I get what you mean
what was ah the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
err oh I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found uh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful uh peaceful what do you call ah called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
ah ya yes
hobbies actually wah hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me lah
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now lah I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like ah I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
I mean it depends on the person practising uh
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like ah
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff lah ya
of course yes
pop malay they call it ya how about you how about you
oh
I go with my sister I go with my sister uh to this to this to this concert um concert
eye-opening experience for me cause like you experience them singing live some more is like
they are the iconic band that people recognise all over the world like it's not only it's not only the singaporeans were there were a lot of ah other people from countries who came to singapore to just watch them westlife
so it's like it was really I remember it was really fun that day and some more it falls on my sister's birthday so ya how about you
I know it's always it always happen ya ya ya
oh it really happen in front of your eyes ah I know okay
I decided to not recently I think last year I decided to purchase a lot of accessories I'm in I'm I started to get interested in accessories so especially in earrings
you can say like err laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me I'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya I'm curious about yours how about you
brown ah brown red call it lah orange uh this kind of colours that I'm more to
love talking about love I suddenly so shy no lah kidding love at first sight
um
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us lah but love at first sight
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like eh oh my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically uh ya very interesting how how what what do you think
oh I understand K K
oh my god okay
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got ah another question for you
uh oh you talk err oh okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
yes correct
I would oh wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our alamak this also very hard lah I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting ah country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that ah from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard lah to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of err
different type aiya basically it's culture lah but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
oh no uh huh
ya ya correct correct ya ya
oh no okay
oh
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore lah like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only what what for we will go like eh let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya ah what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
oh of course of course
any sound eh
when you see sunflower for me lah for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya
yes
if me I know I I I I heard stories that ah rose rose is hard
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you ah much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
make us forget about the busy life in this ah singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from ah from that side that busy lah that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these lah I also really agree with you on all this cause it's

wah hazirah seh
ya it's been so long since I heard from you and ah ah I'm doing just fin
three years and graduate already no
mine is like no exam or whatever just project after project and my course currently taking is visual communication but look at you now working full tim
so since you the graduate righ
I'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
I think you can follow up like that too I gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and oh it sounds interesting though and I wish this COVID thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
I think you can cope lah knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like I said before and you know this pandemic I'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
s
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this COVID it's corrupting everythin
mm why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke I kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard lah cannot bring everyone with us well I'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
for example um maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if I'm not wrong with double decker bed lah but don't have pool so I don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
wah really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel which come with a pool can just chill watc
like around town are
hmm but righ
I think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes I like water activit
and if I'm not wrong I think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
go staycation just chill at the hotel jer and since I'm single and you've got a boyfriend I just nee
err my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a bali vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo
there's plenty of movies to watch for example mulan or something an
um new restaurant near marina bay and this taufik batisah
and many more that time I went um
um cafe hopping with one of our old friend with hidayu if you can remember her we wanted to try the taufik batisah cafe but end up it's like too many peopl
so we end up at this one random restaurant which call aline's cafe like a malay restaurant or somethin
but you know me I'm not a walking person s
I just end up at random place instead you remember about ayu righ
y
it's really shady honestly like it's only like the two of us in that caf
what to do you know me I'm like lazy walker everywhere I go I just grab or something I hate taking public for some reason cause I hate crowd
might as well bring the bring everyone is like so awkward only two of us are playing board board games
and ya maybe one day we can bring bring her along with us or just stay the two of us jer
and y
anywa
I want to say that um since you in a relationship you just have to listen to your partne
right don't really have the freedom to do whatever you wan
but I don't kno
how is it like to b
attached by someone and knowing you right I didn't expect you to be the first one to get attache
I don't know how you do it like so low key I'm so curious like how you know what I mean I'm everything I need to post like social media so it's hard for me to deal with tha
um but it's nice to know that you actually grown up and you know like wow the new hazirah take over the worl
but it's nice lah lik
I'm glad that we still talking until today and boys aside okay the important thing that is me and you need to have a staycation so you better tell me I still got like a few weeks left before I'm bac
same goes to yourself too and ya anyways you know my current job which is delifrance has been toxic so like two days ago I actually went to this interview wit
which I get to interview as a part o
feel so honoured to get to know and see these people like in reality with cause lik
right oh y
ya basically the liyana musfirah lady is is the creepy dude um
brother actually I don't know why he's so creepy I mean he is like wha
twenty five years old but talking to me like a child he's so freaky you kno
well beside him I don't wish to see his face like during meeting or whatever bu
most to most I won't be working with him lah
and ya mostly that basicall
the job is I only need to attend their meeting like what every monday five to seven
but when school reopen I don't know how to deal with that lah basically but I try to be ther
whatever it takes lah
the rest they just work from home so anything just whatsapp whatsapp whatsap
and y
one year and nine months going to two years already can you imagine
can you imagine someone actually got fired because of this toxic manager of mine and ya nobody even likes he
god what to do kan
uh uh
well as a baker they mostly just intend to be inside right not outsid
leh then what's your problem for her not helping out right some more she not good at cashier also an
I find that like what the hell like bro like she been patient for you do you like lik
manager itself lah confront her like why why do you do this to my mother and al
then she still don't want to admit says she still blaming her like don't you have sympathy for someone or or somethin
so what to do kan people can't stay in a toxic environment foreve
wah gonna be like unmemorabl
they just don't look like tha
these people just working like what F&B and such don't mind paying seven dollar to them like they don't know the behind the scene on whatever happening seh but what to do kan it's time for me to like leave also it's been a good long year experienc
environment also like wha
err cutting to payout also they expect people not making sal
like no common sense ah seh I still couldn't the fact about the pregnant lady though what
to tha
but ya
twenty six years old this year and you know me neve
I mean it's weird lah you never meet this person for like for the first time what so a bit awkward for me bu
oh I thought you taking your bike or something then he said oh it's raining that's why I never take the bike then he scold me and sai
we take public okay we take public but y
wel
then I finish the interview for like what fifteen minute
then he have no idea he tell me oh you want to go to museum I was like which museum lik
then we walk walk then we came across this museum I forget the name and it's free then we just go lah
to waste time and um after that we walk walk walk um

I don't mind lah but ya I feel bad he paying for everything that day but um and ya we ended u
going there and I had pasta he also had pasta and we just talk talk tal

then like ya he never go out with someone for six years and he got a lot a lot of ex lah like like sixteen ex girlfriend that was during I mean he is twenty six what do you expect righ
but stil
I mean correct lah I I also never text you everyda

I'm not putting any hopes or whatever lah I mean he is a good guy only you know me I'm very pick
so y
and he also got some work experience to go with s
y
kan it's hard to believe that he actually got sixteen ex girlfriend I mean he is twenty six so four years older than me hmm and ya you're right I got a lot to see first I mean I'm twenty two and I'm still schoolin
ya age is just a number actually I mea
no matter how old you are if you got the willingness strength to study why not give it a tr

um talking about cheesecake right that time I tried to make one and it doesn't turn out okay it's like it turned out flat like a pancake an

that's the whole point of training what
uh huh
wah
right
ya
just just toxic ah
the it's work from home
if you
why you don't prefer
okay lah technically I come from a background so
most of my job
prefer face to face lah so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that oh I want you to make this app for shopee

a few other people lah so
one part of the the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call eh hi how um
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
look at the computer and then there's
do uh oh ya
we cannot complain much ah because
COVID mah
forever sia
ya
err but I feel like
ah I just want to
don't you feel like
you lacking the human interaction
uh
only now what I get to see you so
but it's limited to five
ah
paitao
ya like
I feel you I feel you
like
you come out from your room and then you see their faces you mean
round the clock you have to see their faces I feel you
ya
how many siblings you have
what why oh oh because she's longer in a
a longer relationship is it
oh
oh make okay lah make kind of makes sense because
she got stable job she's she's um
she don't have to
oh she's not
she's a
oh so right now she's also finding for job lah
oh okay lah there's some source of income lah
ya considered a luxury ah because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims what so we do have to you know
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then uh
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really ah that one I don't know sia
oh really ah
what how long already
you and your
oh
how how long have you guys been together
uh I don't think so
almost three years
mm
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun lah because I don't have to work and then
oh my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because err my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and err ya cause I
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there ah I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
um like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
uh huh
mm
ya lah I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get first then
um you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get first then
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded lah
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl ah then they expect a lot of you
female
get out ah
mm
mmhmm
are you will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you uh get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
zao zao
mm
a'ah
mm
well okay lah actually
oh
no for me my
my boyfriend's place is just um
just enough for his family ah I cannot really move into his place
so
no uh um
then what you feel what
oh
I think that's most likely you know
ya my
they move out I don't I don't hope for them to come over
no lah it's not like I don't like it's just
and I got
cats also and she's scared of cats
my
yes
she's very scared of cats though I I not sure how it's gonna turn out
hais
six people is too crowded already bro
I cannot
ya
I
but I really
how about no I should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats lah
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
I saw that coming from a mile away
huh ya lah basically jurong
people are weird I understand I get that a lot
okay they always say jurong people are weird
I I have to admit ah because down here there's a lot of crime that
steal underwear kind
um okay cool I didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
I
I like nowadays I don't
ya
ya
jurong shady ah jurong
especially the west side
country
there's a lot of uh there's not much of commercialised building it's more of uh
industrial building
so a lot of um
foreigners there lah
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know or vehicles
but
you will be scared lah because
uh all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation um
those um touch and run away kind
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house kan
I take I walk from pioneer
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that uh people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know uh
they even take he even took the same lift as me
uh
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know lah
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the
the members and then the members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight ah come ah fight ah
ya
ya ang mo kio
ya got industrial places what there
uh huh
ya I get you
if you know what it's always like that though
I would rather
tanjong pagar still not bad what
tanjong pagar still not bad I feel like around cause my
at city hall
around there
I cannot ah I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so jurong staying at jurong west is quite fitting for me lah you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in jurong west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
okay lah I mean it depends lah
jurong east also considered area but then
what's that area called ah you know hua yi there I forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the
but it's also not close to any
no noises lah you know if you prefer that
ya
oh
ya
used as back up right now lah because of COVID
ya I feel you man I also got some savings that I thought like you know
err rent house somewhere near my office also
somewhere more accessible ah
no not at town at least like
maybe at most
east side ah cause east side I know
east and north side basically is
you got direct transport to town what
ya but my area my west like we have to
okay also direct transport but then
it's really long ah
and it gets crowded
at my area boon lay there you know so
I don't do I don't do again I don't do well with crowds ah eh
what to do
I just can't
what's that called your
currently your plan is what
to
ya like cause you were saying that
you prefer to get married right now right
oh
mmhmm
ah
eight years is a really long time
so
hopefully he will change his we it will because you got say before that he is madam
focus on school
just spendings what
ya that's like totally different
don't we all girl don't we all
your boyfriend what race
your boyfriend what race
what race

how you guys met
how you guys met
ah online dating
ah for for me I feel like thirty five still quite young though
I I actually I
uh
with my current partner now
oh okay
your prime age
ya
but you have to think about the cost and everything
cause my
ya my my boyfriend is also uh
chinese but he's a italian chinese
he's more of the european side
so
I feel that there is a communication barrier between us lah but
uh
that was it's still okay lah it's manageable
uh in terms of
uni ya cause we same we same course he's taking the same course and then we have similar interest which
which is uh gaming
you game also what game

I play
I play a fair share of
um
games from a lot of platforms okay mobile games

how did you know
oh oops
sorry
so um
what do you want to know
uh
okay
whoa oi
hmm right
okay so
we went to walk around bugis
but
ya then um
then cause I saw innisfree right then I had to buy my facial wash so I was like eh can we go innisfree then he was like okay can can then cause when we were talking um we were chatting on telegram
he we kept finding like that we kept finding out that we had a lot of
similar stuff and
not common interest it's like
we do some
similar stuff then we also buy similar stuff
all of that
stuff
so we were like creeped out
so he asked me
what
so what kind of facial wash do you buy then I say
the bija one then he was like
alamak we have to stop buying doing the same stuff then I was like
I already bought it first so
yes
ya cute cute don't even didn't even work out
ah
when was it it was like in
I think july okay wait we went out like second july I remember the date
ya then I mean I'm not gonna blame his friend's death lah but like it went downhill from there
so cannot really say much
then
I'm not
as cheerful as you were you know
like
I give him space to like mourn his friend's death and stuff but
at some point it's
just too much I guess
when I'm
but you know how I am right
eh are you okay like are we okay that kind of stuff but like at this
I understand and I don't want to push him too much but like
meh
there was no closure honestly
he ghosted me
no it's okay
then he ghost me I'm like bro
ya
kind of like told me some stuff that make me like feel better a little bit but he didn't he just like blue tick me and went away so I don't know what to do I mean I am getting over him ah but
I mean
but he's such a good guy though
no I'm not
full of crank
honestly I think so
but
no I don't want
if he is
I will just say that um
friends
thumbs up and a heart
friend zone
input
ya it's a difficult situation
that's why okay that's why when I you know me I always confront stuff pe I feel like
that should like at least show him that I care about him what but I actually do care about him is just that
at some point I feel like
trying too hard I guess
cause I okay I I I like check up on him like every two days then he will always reply like he will always give late replies but like at least he reply
hmm
no cause okay the thing is when we started first started talking right he always reply me very fast maybe cause it's period ah but eh
fast replies mm
so but
all this pain
not worth it I guess
you see we just been talking for what two three months
I don't think I don't
ego
you know
unless unless like what
then he will chase me and
no
mm
now also I'm not looking also
men are trash
why are we made to be straight when allah create men like this
okay philosophy
ya I do
how about you did you get some boy action
kind of
okay
oo
oh and oh no
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay got it
mmhmm
uh huh
mmhmm
wait
is it also in the instagram account I follow him
the third one
ah
how many instagram account you have sia
oh my god
oh okay okay
is he white
men
at all
I like how this time around you are okay
about all of these
um I got one
more news I mean
ya
but then like after I stop
talking to the guy I went out with a date with
on a date with
um
but it's not on whatsapp
it was on wechat when we first talk to each other then he's like I really want to talk to you then I was like bro
huh
so
I don't think they will get send back ah cause he supposed to be three years there this is his first year
so
no I didn't
wechat no blue tick
I deleted the chat
but
now I feel like I want to reply him cause okay it's not cause I have
I don't know probably happy that you got back together then why he why do you want to talk to me again like
why
I mean the thing is I can still talk to him as a friend but like overseas friend but I mean I won't I won't fall in love with him again bro
but
it's like I just want to know why you want to talk to me okay whatever the hell you done
but like at the same time I don't want to tell him to let him feel like I have been thinking about him
and like I have been what debating but I don't think men think until that kind of part you know cause men are like simple
when they overthink it's about it's not about this
overthink about something else
games

oh you think about sex
no one think about feelings
stupid
mm

what do
december will be like what one year since we met
he doesn't
I don't need long I don't need a long time to know him to know how he is
but the other guy yes cause I don't understand him
cause okay the thing is right if you if I confront you about something and then he straightaway was like oh I'm not perfect boyfriend material blah blah blah blah like he starts off
the
debate quotation mark debate
with that sentence in particular that means we are in a talking stage right
and then he

the the pain went away I was like wait oh okay
so I cried for nothing
how the heck
it's pain no cannot I don't want
ya
like I have this trick where you lie down flat on the ground with no pillow on your head then it's just like straight straight then it will hurt but it will flatten out your back cause of gravity
so
ya but I don't know didn't really work but
the yoga pose
oh
later can
but my back not pain anymore
inshaallah
retail
but I don't think that is that
um
as painful as that cause
knife
I got cut myself you know
the auntie literally was like eh be careful that one sharp ah you don't touch
I literally didn't even touch it I was just
it was just like
um
I didn't really put force you know it was just like a
a tap or something my palm tap the knife the blade
and then I get a damn cut
and there was so much blood and the auntie scold me
the auntie was like
no I didn't
I didn't
I didn't hold
but ya
it was painful
but I'm not scared of cuts lah but it's just like
subway subway
the place is really toxic the workplace is very toxic
I can don't tell you that it is toxic
wait what did you friend what did your friends didn't say
ya they do
okay it's not like reuse the bread lah it's like
they will just keep it in the bread um
what's that
the place where they store the bread
and then the next day breakfast if people order then we will use that
but but I mean cause we toast it right
we toast it before we serve so
it's
right
I mean
if it's mouldy we will not
sell the bread lah
but like for vegetable I can say that um cause I cut vegetables right
ah you know bell peppers
the top and the bottom actually have to cut it off but then um cause they say like sometimes cause uh not enough or something
we will cut that too
then we include it in the box in the container then we serve
customer that
the only thing I take is like lettuce and cucumber carrot but cucumber we cut ourselves lettuce no they come in bags vacuum packed
so I guess lettuce is fresh but
and the rest is also fresh lah cause
we always get
every time every time is production day
always we always have to order directly
the vegetables
so I guess it's quite fresh lah not bad
uh it's a small restaurant thai to go but
eh that one right the pay masyaallah
I mean the thing is right we only take orders serve customer uh maybe sometimes wash dishes and then we have to make sure that delivery orders are
like they order through online right so we we have we will get emails about the orders so you have to print the order give to the kitchen and the delivery rider
that's all it's not that it's not that um
complicated
why
orh
I mean I mess up a lot of times
so
like
but the way they key in the order is cool it's like
all on the computer
you know like how
restaurant key in orders is like there's a kiosk at the front right no it's inside the office
it's not even a kiosk it's a computer
it's not like that
ours is a computer
then the money all okay maybe it's just not a established restaurant ah but
it's cool
bro eight dollars per hour and like
the work is not even that stressful I can just sit there and do my shit know
cause so far away
it's at okay it's like now it's uh you know kembangan station
but I mean I can text her oh I can text her back and be like can I work
mm
I think you have to go interview
but I'm
I can go and work
but
um there's a straight bus from your house eight five four
I will I will also take eight five four but you have to walk a bit ah
ya
we get free lunch and dinner if you work that's why I like working there and the pay is way more than like
Subway
is
ya
I should have bargained bro
can like at least seven dollars lah sia
my back hurts from nothing for six fifty only but then
I guess six fifty is easy money
cause subway
I don't know how it was easy money ah cause every month I can get four hundred but they minus for also gang ten percent only
so
but that one is if I work like almost
almost everyday I work sia
four hundred
mm
if not it's like what one hundred two hundred
mm
that one the the um
four hours
and that one can get really
thirty six dollars
already
no cause we have quite a lot of admin also
I think ah I'm not sure how good they they grow or like did they even grow cause right
kind of hard
but
this everyone else is guy except for you
that's why it's a little bit scary for me
but they won't do anything
I hope
I mean
a mouse
you're a mouse
I mean
oh
no
then I'm not scared
ya I know
I was scared too
they were adults and when I was working that time I was like seventeen
and then like
bro sometimes they
wait the
okay so got
a few times I work closing so I have to make sure that
then the kitchen obviously the cooks will handle it right but then
I already put
the dishes like the customers ate from
at the back
so they have to wash it what but then never then I'm like
got rats
will come cockroaches will come
so I went to on the kitchen lights
it was like damn dark
outside
cause it was at night like nine and it but my father was outside ah cause he was waiting for me he pick me up always
if I work at night
so ya
then when I mop I on songs
so ya
that time I always did closing ah then my father always pick me up

cause it's a small restaurant
then got everywhere
you take money people can see
then we have to ensure the float is like fifty hundred but um different cash or whatever then if the kitchen want to buy more eggs or whatever they need to tell me then I give the money then they have to give me the receipt then I have to keep in the float

I don't know they never say anything
honestly okay the thing is right started way before school started
but they are still unprepared
and I hated that
no brain
you already know this is happening but you still didn't prepare and then
always got last minute changes then the students also panic ah sia
the one that's doing the work is the student not you you just don't want the
telling us oh you need to do this that that but the one that is doing the work is us
mmhmm
mm
one of my lecturers also like that
like okay cause
ya science
um
so it's more theory based
but the thing is she reads off the slides
in her lecture videos
and it's so annoying cause when she gives us test
or uh quizzes
even though it's open book you cannot find it in the notes
so how am I supposed to answer the questions
then later we fail you'll be like
then if she go through
isn't this in the notes
why don't you try reading your notes and referring back to your question and find the answer to your question even if you know the answer already there is no answer in the notes
ya but
do you know the feeling where like after you have done you are done with everything then you read again then you understand
that that always happen to me
but I'm not smart actually
I'm not
I just know my shit
you take you need the time to know

oh
I only watch drama at suria

in suria
um I don't know if you watched but is a classic drama is a local
uh show
made by suria
no lah uh I'm glad that
Netflix
watch any movie anytime anywhere
uh and you also
so you need to wait for a few months or
probably go to another website to find
your favourite uh show or anime
so now
Netflix
ya basically
that's been our life for
long
just
sleep
this is what we do everyday
ya I don't really wake up early
so I'm more of a afternoon person
so once I wake up
but it's already late so I've nothing much to do
um
eh um
sorry
ya I don't know what I was saying just now
then uh maybe
grades
and um
uh
so when do you graduate
two years
um
I only left with
four months
um then after four months
then
um just
work
then uh if there's
uh school school uh if I want to continue studies maybe I will continue with
diploma
then are you planning to continue your studies after diploma
I think for me
this day and age I think it's time to work full time
because with this COVID
so it's best for me to work
and at least have a stable job
so I don't need to worry about uh
uh money anymore
I
okay with
because uh
but ya
good that uh I have a friend like you
err that helps me a lot
so
ya during your secondary school days
sec one sec two I join
I didn't know
join rugby
so I've
played rugby
ya so
rugby err
is with me since uh secondary school
and now I'm in a uh club
uh tamoko lions
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
I can see on my uh
meets
ya
uh I recently got injured because of my bad leg
but the doctor say it was nothing it was just normal sprain
so I'm glad that uh nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
orh
um when I was young I like extreme sport
um
err then uh
secondary school I go to
err
skatepark and I like skateboarding
uh hopefully that
um
speaking of commitments uh I think
err
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
um I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably err go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news ah fake news
so uh I really want to go karaoke with my friends ah
and for my girlfriend uh probably go out on a date
somewhere uh and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
oh
uh anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
oh ya um actually
err go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
oh uh
um
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go sentosa
uh go beach with my family and
and uh you know swim
um I'm not afraid of heights
are you
um
but like it's different experience from
like roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
um I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube err like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
uh I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
err when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
um my favourite car is
uh
uh
uh is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
um
my favourite car is mostly uh japanese
for example uh Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
um
tokyo drift is one of them
ah actually
but I only watch till
and I watch uh
way before ah
uh nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because uh he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
err like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
um
and uh the manager himself that uh brought man untied to win uh
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
uh they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win uh all the uh season
and err what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
uh probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya uh um
mm
ya I also
err
go back into the normal state lah
and everybody starts to work normally and uh uh
ya
stick to the uh rules
we will not go to phase three
yes I agree with you so
we just need to
move on
and pray for the best

it's a small group lah not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then um the place also okay lah not so busy last time used to be very busy but now um because of the COVID thing so companies send their
ah their staff
a participant they only allocate uh fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like err two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
oh I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the err
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is um they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges lah
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
um the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge ah one que
and one and then myself doing um
but surprisingly all the participant came for
ah
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
mmhmm
ah she ah panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause uh every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and um
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different lah this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid lah I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister lah but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really lah
timid is different from people who is fierce shah timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that uh these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but err she turned to me and tell me of like um
mm mm
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you um
cute lah but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no um
uh huh
uh huh
you didn't
mm
mm ya
mm
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
mm
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much ah maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
um
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
oo
uh sooner or later she she will forgot how to err right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the uh leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad lah mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
um
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
um
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put err into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got um cousin lah she could say ah eight boys ah the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be err medical attention given to her ah anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then err third she got um caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver mm they have
err nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know um half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday err maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so lah because she's already bedridden
um don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this um
that's that's what my opinion is lah
ya I know
mm
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this err dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya lah I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
oh eh you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation lah
err
mmhmm
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our money ah nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem lah people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right err your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card err see see and then err this this lady said hey you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is err err giving some uh help fund because I really apply then is it oh you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true mm how to accommodate right
um
um
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious lah I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite um err
complex lah I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
um I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
um I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at err until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't uh take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that uh you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
ah sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
ah contribute no that's what I think lah
I I mean right now this is
uh right now right now right now at this situation that I um
at present ah most of my err friends
mm
oh you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
um ya
um how you want to err how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that oh it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
um
um ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really ah really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand lah
um that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
ah
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say lah don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability lah
the
um mm um
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have err your energy level is our only that point of time eh is that much

approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet

ya lah ya lah
ah
alcohol
things that
are not allowed lah in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead lah with it
segregate your assets lah so I think one good err platform to that we can use is
I as far as I know this is the
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
uh
um and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
uh forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
oh okay so like
err ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge lah then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside lah of of using
wahed invest
um
how to say eh
what err things you have to face lah if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up lah with this all these service charge lah when these banks
new way
true
do it the halal way then it's the best lah
ah correct
a'ah deep
ya correct lah I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also

err you just come
mayor lah then like also same same thing like
there the town will like discuss on who is the
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game ah
but if we're in town of salem this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game lah but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore

like it's a bit not like bend fully but it's a bit like bendable so what happened was he actually took it and I think I didn't see I honestly don't know what happened but I think I assume that he actually bend it until it broke after it broke he just looked at me guess what face he made
ya I never even scold him and then
yup he cry and then I immediately sent him to the room terrible sia this boy

so he actually vomitted at work and then they sent him home because it's like you know COVID measures and stuff like that

ya but until you are old and grey
really

really
march oh ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
really
ya but still that's a month apart what it's not the same date what
I don't know ah let me think about it ah I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that ah which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home ah cause the home is a bundled family thing what
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
oh
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
but with no sub charges ah
oh chey how sure are you
oh but you cannot change to singtel
same like ayim right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay lah
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya sia it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what oh you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course lah someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like uh
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish what
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
ira jer ah

for the first time in your life
so guys this is a stand up comedy and we are having our podcast and zaini is undergoing through torture that's so funny no please this is not a podcast
nobody would listen to this stupid lame podcast of these two this couple
also husband but you're doing a good job
eighteen ya that's true eighteen minutes I think we did a good job let's see how it goes I mean I think if you now what at forty two minutes obviously we have to complete the
it's okay
ya
of myself which is not reliable because I'm biased myself
ya that's true
of course not why would I do that that's just digging my own grave
we are doing this for money could you have some pity on us because this has been a lot of effort on our part
ya
no the crotchet to my phone
then it came off then what's the point
ya that's true ah and then are you gonna finish up the star wars
okay why don't we try one question
ah please the questions are quite fun okay um
I remember the question was mm if you had a superpower what would the superpower
what would you want as a superpower
I think I want to read people's mind do I really hmm
what would you want the superpower to be
ya
fly
that's not a superpower dude
because he's rich
ah
really such a
oh ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function oh is it oh that's his flaws
ah
I don't know actually if I have a superpower I think if I have a superpower I will travel back in time
dude mine is the most superpower among your rich rich is not a superpower
no
what
no who say you can buy people uh oh my god the person who's gonna vet this conversation is totally gonna judge you for saying that
your superpower you want to be rich and that you want to buy your wife what the hell is wrong with you
your wife
I'm not gonna let you buy me
with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually mm I don't know what a superpower be
then another one more was
last
huh one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
ya then rizal got stabbed then what else happen
oh ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
err
ya exactly so which means ushu have to still like be in good terms with them what
rahman sia
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house what
that's very um vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya lah that's true ah
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it ah meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say eh I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
huh
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting ah as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know lah he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand lah could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know lah I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
mm ya
ya lah true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the de la salle
five years of course ah he's like that what which is good ah I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around choa chu kang area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works sia
alhamdulillah
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
inshaallah no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block what
ya probably lah
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay lah also not bad
can he go
ya lah that's true
inshaallah inshaallah
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school what de la salle is a catholic school
so
oh ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else oh I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya lah that's true see how lah I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
eh dude
eh
what's wrong with that it's good what to be prepared
grubby like very I don't know he has a malay vibes

ah alright okay so
you know how we started on sixteen
then after that
ah it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so uh
set of tactics to use and gegenpress tiki-taka all all pre-default
okay but then
mm so there's more tactical freedom lah in that sense
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever lah so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then ah
four two three one
so there is no restrictions on that however
kan
uh
mm
mm
yes
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything kan this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
ah
so
mm
I have yet to check spanish league
belgian I think belgian league don't have then err
all those minor minor small small leagues lah
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game lah yesterday lah I mean
I tried a few clubs ah yesterday like err dortmund
then I switch over to uh chelsea then I switch over again to zagreb then switch over now I'm back at dortmund
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to lah
was four years orh
that's four years difference you know
siol
sixteen will be come out fifteen pe ah
uh
by right they should be launching in september october lah but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so err
twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
ah so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first ah
at the end of day it's free pe if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one pe
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
still can be able to run sixteen so I feel like it should be fine ah
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot lah cause graphic is very very minimal
should be no issue ah
it's quite big ah
okay
I think should be no issue already lah cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
very very detailed
outliers
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
ah
so they add a psychological concept to the game tau
so then your core players kan the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything kan
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
ah
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game ah
no cause
okay you see eh it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest tau
ah
ah then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my dortmund case is
hummels was from bayern pe
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
ah you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
mm
mmhmm
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club lah
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new pe even though he's old
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat barcelona five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during barcelona eight two defeat to bayern munich
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team lah
mm
mmhmm
mm
no no no no no no
cause you already technically purchase for it already
mm
but then let's say you have uh twenty on your steam account okay
your twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam uh epic games account
you can you can try ah I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow lah cause
it's quite a big game lah but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me lah
ah seriously
oh K K K K
okay ah then those things do not need high internet speed everything
ah then I don't think that one can run lah
ah
internal cleaning tau
there's a few things that affect your your computer speed lah so dust is one thing
and then after that uh the make and model if it's outdated then
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst lah I mean
so it's very
it's quite intensive lah ah ha
eh eh
ya in a sense ah
oh okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again lah to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on kan so
in this version was the medical centre
ah so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot lah I haven't really jump into medical centre yet lah you can explore it later ah
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker eh whoa that would be damn good
oh you just press play play play play for ages siol
oh ya there is a singapore league inside ah ya
ah you
I mean this is a precedented situation pe
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle lah I mean ah like like there's one club
in twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
half your squad missing ah
ah
all the north ah
even the north south are not semi-pro tau
they are pro you know
fall from grace ah I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off ah their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with ah cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end lah cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
ah crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so you end up still going down pe
mm
it depends lah cause
unless you
liquidate the club ah
unless you dissolve the club ah
no
I buy over your club
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated kan cause of the financial fair play rules uh you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K pe just nice your club will stay afloat
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue ah
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down ah until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial ah
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
so they face financial difficulties they were in serie ah
okay serie A
ah
ha
third corruption
okay so what did club did was ah they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
ah to stay afloat lah so uh what juventus did was juventus pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
ah then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again ah
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing ah
but it is possible ah like clubs like
wimbledon wimbledon ah that is a new club by itself
cause they split from dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this ah where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues lah I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this lah
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this ah err one particular example I know is dons ah
dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then ah
english
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
I mean
look look at our situation
you used to lah still am lah so it's a difference
definitely ah I mean look at your size
ya lah it's cause
no lah maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile pe
ya lah so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change lah
I
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal kan before the pandemic situation ah then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
okay so imagine the players charging towards you eh running with the ball and everything
idea kan
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least tau
no lah I mean
at the end of the day
solid sia
I forgot which year that was lah err
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten ah around there lah
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so ah every other party kan
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight suria and the vasantham channel so uh every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the
all across all four channels lee hsien loong face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him ah
it was a thirty minutes speech
ya I mean
no lah I mean okay you see eh for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation eh for our generation ah at the most ah
our first language is usually english
quite solid
okay it's
so these are the kids where
their the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
so obviously you only remember your first language pe cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
english ah cause
that's the language that we are used to
from but you said in ah
probably ah babe
I don't think it's depending on ah your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in lah
language that you use most often cause let's say kan
ah so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english ah okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language pe english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english pe
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a this is the language they use everyday
I mean at the end of day also
he will do one
okay but
I mean
eleven or eight eleven or eight ah screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down pe it's better than coming up kan the stairs kan okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
ah thank god
I can tell lah I mean
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a ah
a cycle to work to look forward to lah everyday lah but now is just
I mean
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside lah
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
haiya
it's a shame ah
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
whoa
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere kan
mm so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different pe everyday you have to use your vessel
mm
no ah
it's still quite low lah but it's not
that low also lah I mean
car oil and uh jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference ah
from how many litres to how many of litres ah so
no lah that one
it really depends on current situation ah I mean
as of now damn slow ah
to pick up ah
honestly this situation is worst when corona ah worst than SARS pe
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently government
ban the postal service from sending masks to every household in america
ah so then the
this this lady was saying wah this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello ah seh they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing lah so I
think logically lah I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with

yes happy new year
ya true
uh huh
uh huh
yes
uh huh uh huh
ya the real world comes

why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food oh my god

in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money err ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt lah
a'ah

I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years lah

pbb err ya lah I mean now
ya ya nothing nothing much to look forward to
nowadays lah like I I really want to travel lah I really want to save money and
and travel lah so ya lah a lot a lot you cannot do a lot of things right now lah
mm you know during COVID so
ya so all I can do is is find job right now ah the the last
they're talking about talking about my uh barbering job and all that I
I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that lah so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought um monday since since uh like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay lah the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night lah night shift like I can work from eleven to
err eleven to I think
seven ah seven seven eleven near
near my house lah near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny leh I I didn't
I didn't get a reply ah they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get seh I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job kan
ah yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're err ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so ah it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier lah so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which uh which location you prefer
then
huh
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call lah then they so far never call they're taking quite some time ah I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true lah true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that err right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that um
some people are not really serious about the job lah they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point lah so
that's what my mother said lah then I I think I think quite
true lah like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
err I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they ah um
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
err diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary lah a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs lah so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya lah of course lah I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like um if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time lah I will I will do mm
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently lah I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up lah definitely like um
ya getting easily more tired or you know like um
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different lah when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like um oh I'm the best I can do
oh I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
um you realize
you're not really the best ah other people better than you or then you
you start to ya lah it's a different thing lah
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also lah different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya lah different different privileges
yes
correct lah actually actually true lah I I
ah I know I mean the the the thing is that because err right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk lah I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
ah nicely have respect for elders but
huh I don't know about the the the the current um I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all lah some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have um respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job lah teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people lah so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them lah like um
like old old people old values lah old values like like um
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya lah it's it's all a small thing lah at the moment mm ya
mm
maybe ah because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay lah that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
mm
pass very fast lah for me so
so a'ah lah
was more relaxed lah more
laid back chill ya
so um
COVID I mean
mm
apocalypse no lah
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing ah nothing much lah
I I was just trying to get along earn money lah you know ya
ya
oh okay okay okay ya the first the very first um
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one lah phase one circuit breaker was
was ya lah it's a bit a bit um
a bit stressful lah stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
oh circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like ah I I don't care lah I will still go out lah I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that lah I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing lah then I I
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing lah so it's not like
just go out you know like
um
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also lah
ya
weird lah you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly um
hmm
mm
ya mm definitely different
different time lah you know err nobody
nobody expected this to happen lah so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed lah that time they a lot of people stressed err a lot of uh
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry lah then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct mm
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs eh actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like tampines interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from tampines interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like um
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
err cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot uh like harder
times lah a lot of people going through like more hardship lah you know that
if you think you are like
quite sometimes I feel quite um
I just feel quite sad lah sometimes when I see all this lah ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced lah forced to
forced to stop working and
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
ya but anyway like um
mm
mmhmm
wherever lah
five thousand a month like that right they suddenly they got no money then
there's a lot of them do catering business ah catering business they do sell
ya then it's not only that lah uh basically the music business
right now is definitely
everything have stopped lah then no cannot get money lah music business
so the next thing that
err like coming up and surviving is actually video video companies lah video
I mean um
right now video is doing
more important lah video is doing well lah like ya um
I mean although like audio and video goes together together to make a err uh to make a content right so
are out there lah there are more video jobs than than audio jobs so
oh I if had taken a video err course or what then
mm
is like lessons from home all zoom zoom lessons from home right so

or at least my encounter with them the first time was that the giraffes were very cheeky

doing he choice for them ya they can be anything and a lot of things but
they never ever get to choose

I started at nineteen what
um after I was bored then I decided to sign up for all
then I said okay then nineteen years old I went to audition
I was doing backstage work
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything ah is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
lie there then after that I say okay so um it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay lah my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
and um
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try lah two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
watching the show and then um second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like astaghfirullahalazim she was like

uh take over whoever's not here lah so I was just doing my job very well lah whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it

mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
alah that one
um
okay lah but
that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
ah
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing lah I want to grow up I want to become
um
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course lah that
um
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why eh oh I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no lah no lah no lah it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got err theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful lah
and I wasn't doing very well in eh no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry eh no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
uh attended this lah you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that ah so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay lah give you more job ah then now I started learn
um
uh
like other skills lah like I've got to learn more about it
teaching then after now now I realised what is my purpose lah
mm
oh you went to watch that one ah ya it wasn't my first show lah but it was the first show that probably you watch
mmhmm
okay
mm mm
mm
ah ah
ya I mean I I love the show ah really I really help her but then
wah this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more uh but ya got big issue lah that one until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice lah it's really about you say lah your marketing
to win your audience um
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
mm then how you guys do it
mm
mm
let's try one of these prompts lah ha
mm
okay
okay
they always sell the masala chai in um
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in dollars
the chai but in that cup the big cup huh can I I say ya ya ya
I I don't know I'm just addicted to tea lah so but I like ah masala chai ah you like tea right
um
chai basically is tea what
delivery alamak
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not uh okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
err
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival lah but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
huh what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one eh washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no lah but it's it's it's buy one get one free what
ah okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
uh okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
mm if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
oh
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
oh
on purpose
why ah
oh eh okay okay
oh
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
mm
mm
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill uh I want uh
um
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will lah ah
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move ah
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie ah a fighting film ah
cool lah but mm
and I don't like to fight ah
ya but then no lah I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
eh you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no lah just uh uh uh generic
um a lot of the but uh just basic ones lah very introduction to all the different therapies lah
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can lah you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay lah two weeks right
but some people they might say that
eh
dare to ask me we're not even that close um you know
you know
um
we take that example is not a very good example lah like one uh like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
um
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that lah but then
in the end um
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that ah so it's very uh and I err so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around ah you know it made me feel uh like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel um
that
uh you feel lah
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that lah I
if you could pick up your own stuff
um
would you be doing it lah am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well lah okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay lah you ask me then I can say yes I can say no lah
ya it's like a demand kan to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how ah how to
balance that out I try to figure it out lah
ya but won't
mm
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
mm
mm
ya I see hard ah
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
um
but you are following your dreams kan
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
so formal
who do you speak with usually
mm mm
that
that's not real lah it's not the code is not the what to say
mm mm
language
mm
mm mm
mm
oh no
recording interrupted
oh let's pause first oh shoot
okay lah it's fifty five minutes fifty six seconds
err nevermind let me ask her uh
oh no okay uh
let me ask
hi my recording got interrupted
at the fifty five
minute
fifty six seconds mark
okay let me settle
should be okay lah alright nevermind we just submit this one lah
oh stop stop stop

hmm three wishes right
I want to help the poor maybe uh I feel that err it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then next uh the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes furqan
uh
my views on what your wishes are it's actually uh is very good from what I see you are a people person like err like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at tampines I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like err taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say uh for example I I share an example ah
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food uh food court I teleport to the place
then after that uh I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay err you said it can increase because the person uh didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so err let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about err going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and uh maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's uh maybe uh the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
we only expose to the office
ah which is easier to contact tourists
it is uh something
err
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know err be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
err I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one err mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of uh being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe uh act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but err
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it uh
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that err you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to uh ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that err you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means err if a person is a father
okay so err what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of uh two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man uh should isolate himself
for months
I feel uh I I agree to a certain extent err where
let's say this person have uh no responsibility maybe uh no parents no siblings no children no wives then uh I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say err okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example uh a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
actually err pretty similar ah on on the investment part because err actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves err a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
err
if you were to tell me that investment is uh is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe err last time I was maybe too good ah I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society err when they see oh a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much err about monetary err maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old err ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more uh gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this uh money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go uh anywhere that I want because err there's a certain level of err financial freedom I would say
second topic
oh my my memory memory is err degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
oh I admit uh do you have you heard of uh about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep uh items
or uh photos ah to then err to keep in a secret place or maybe err some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video err it's like a conversation with uh my old my my oldest self so let's say err my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually err when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so uh I just hope I don't lose the video lah actually I don't even remember where is it now
hmm I like to be famous yes
but
but uh I think is uh if I were to take myself a picture of myself err every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
one of the nicer waters in uh asia that uh that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic err trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so err I think there is err what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of uh funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that err short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then uh another err much more serious err
uh experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me err makes me err
then err maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was uh I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that err jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to uh go into uh into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then err
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that err it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually err and even err just now I was riding a bike
err due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so uh I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
uh
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
err someone is err or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of err delivery riders who is uh riding very recklessly around uh uh on the road ah because they are
err chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe uh road uh sorry uh lorry drivers lorry drivers
err less trip
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because err err when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example err if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can err plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering uh maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that err we are not so err I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe uh three hobbies one is err maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start err ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
err I would know I'm I'm not really a good uh soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because err I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that uh soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me err easily when whenever err people especially uh in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said oh let's play soccer outside
uh this way you gain uh relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and err in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems err I think is is is quite interesting
err
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some err activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure uh how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because err in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals err so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less err how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think uh as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
err
so far I think eh all the err hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from err we are kind of uh similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

okay
eh I need
ya anyway this one danish coming over sia he want meet me for a while

then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also ah
oh genshin is just my browser not loading ah I think if maybe got to do with my internet connection at that point in time
but I yet to try again ah
the main part of the whole thing ah
mm
but like
ah
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
uh huh
okay
uh huh
ah
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
oh I see I see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
mm
ya right right right
the best so far
one of ah
ah better than runescape
ah
ya confirm laze ah after a while
ya ya
maybe lah perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but I think they earning a lot sia this game it's like available on all platform except like console lah
you can whale on genshin also
uh huh
huh wah this crazy ah
wah
so you think this one more
you know money intensive or maple
ah
do you even spent money on games
orh okay ya okay makes sense
orh
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
oh
ya ya ya
oh why eh
how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
bayern very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth ah
hmm ya each to its own ah
ha when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
fuh
when's the last time when's the last time you went
ah
oh so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
can ah try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent ah and like
they really build up their name eh you know like
those DOTA players players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by uh Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there ah pretty nice lah you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same ah throughout all these brands I would say
ah
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
mm
ya
eh but this one is like high quality leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do lah but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these uh
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding eh I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
uh let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than eh APOL is three nine eight
ya
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
mmhmm
ya ya
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
uh that one obvious sia the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like um forceful kind of you know
what they call it ah damage on your behalf then it would be voided ah
I
over time maybe yes ah
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
uh huh
ya kinda it is it is
ya
that's true ah Coke like damn sweet eh I I'm not a fan of Coke ah it's too sweet for me
ah
ya standard correct
ah
oh carton
ah
ya ya syrup kind of base drink ah
that's non-fizzy
mm Seasons the blue colour one right
that's the green tea ice lemon tea eh is it
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
eh wait seasons
oh I think I got I think I never try Seasons uh peach tea before eh
oh no I don't think so eh the I can't recall
maybe ah
mm
uh
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
because you got the mindset lah like you know there's a
relax corner in school
ya
ya true true
uh
I also finding ah I want find like uh you know like stable kind of part-time
and nine dollars ah if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of um eatery
never banquet I never do before that time was uh kitchen job ah
ya Grand Hyatt ah
so you know when banquet uh how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already ah that's why
orh
Shangri-La
uh huh
gary gary kan you know gary then the alex those people
events
ah ya ya ya they are events uh lighting all this kind of stuff
oh
orh
uh huh
a'ah
oh
ya ya
so it's a win win
it's a win win situation lah
ya
true
because
eh since when you care sia bro
okay lah okay lah uh you changed man right
no the swedish bistro uh they call it
ya
uh huh
I'm not sure ah if that's Fika or something some other cafe near arab street last time
mm
err but how much was the food
so Fika or the what's that called ah
Malayan Council eh
huh serious
I never tried that food before ah but the desserts not bad ah quite delicious
uh ya my sis told me also because the boss kan like it's uh this chinese guy
he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right ah
ah
ya that's why that's why is the owner is smart he
mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
uh the next time they just go then use the voucher to get like
you know cakes and uh tea or something like that
good good the
actually I don't know also I never see the store in person before
ya around there ah arab street haji lane
damn long ah I never go this kind of place
eh next time
eh of course ah I broke man need to find work
go there then step give the akshay face ah
no beef lah then like just laze ah
hey beef is on bro
wah I need to watch the thing
ya that's why at first I thought it was like a
just a group of friends they just wanna try something then until I see the pro skater came into their video
to their series then I'm like huh
can't be like just a random fellow can managed to get a skater
a proper renowned skater you know to come in
uh huh
ya exactly
uh
ya it can never get old ah
which one
uh I don't know I haven't been like keeping up to date ah with their videos
shit I never watch I never see that
you and him met first then I was still on the way there
ya
eh I injured man right
or how who else sundair but achap cannot what
I thought you say he's out for the month
talk on Discord eh don't say like that
have a day outing
that
hashtag
mm later he got hashtag dare to stab
eh
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish uh cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
huh
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like uh it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
ah ya something like that
but it's quite dope ah
ya
five I don't know ah I never see since the pre-order part
I think no ah like they still publish ah it's just that it's out of stock on the main uh website if I'm not mistaken
ah but you don't actually own you didn't own one right

it
it's good good actually I quite surprised the thing err like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that ah Vita
ah Vita Vita
Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
I think
mm I think the main appeal is just because can support the
uh what's Pokemon games people literally buy just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new what this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame lah to me

ya ya why

ya that's my job lor then I like
err work err from monday to friday lah ya
then how about you
oo
ya tell me figures ah so that I know that my job this err
okay lah per hour babe
mmhmm
walao I eight dollar fifty only eh then got some more
he came to me ah then he he ask me err err wait
what do I do what do I do if I miss my number then I say
I already put your basket already why you sit down later you will be served then he say
no no no is my english very bad that you don't understand why is the
counter fourteen is empty why is nobody there is it
alamak then you know my my senior was like
keep silent then I keep quiet I keep quiet because she's my senior mah so I keep quiet lah okay I keep quiet
then after that he say hello why nobody answering my question then me and my
me and my friend was like err then we just went back to the our back uh
ya ya we straight up ignored him because like we don't want to
how to say like make it more I don't know how to say the tension like you know
like build up the tension or what kan so we just
so we just waited until like someone call him the another counter to call him and serve him lah
ah actually confront him because I was almost on my like
like you know then I'm like ah ya lah that's what happened ah that's one of it ah
mm
ya they think they think they old they
they we they think we need to serve them and everything but actually there's more uh actually oh my god
will think that oh I wait for mm
hello ah um sorry I wait for one hour um
it is one hour the waiting time because it's a lot of patients not just you
correct right ya so ya some of them don't understand you know
ya lah which is which is expected lah but that's like one of the few incidents lah it's it's normal you know but like as someone who is a youngster
like to see a lot of err older people everyday
less younger people of the same age it's a bit like and they see you as a
kid ah then I can get my ways sometimes they're like that so sometimes we have to stand our ground lah ya so you know
singaporeans like very kiasu and very like you know
ha they wah new iphone new iphone ah they can what
so like I'm quite interested in like how you handle the like
your workplace ya like are they okay they're they're okay right
quite chill lah all okay lah okay lah
ya lah ya lah ya
smooth ah smooth ah gucci ah gucci
I don't know I I've been thinking about it cause like
me my course my course is mm media production and design kan
if I'm wrong lah so
mm like designer
like magazine magazine you know lah whatever lah ya so anything advertising really so
like publicity or whatever it's just that I need to find which also
like which company that I want to go to because I think I
I you know a lot of people now want experience you know so
I don't know I've been thinking about it lah like
like just stop like just stop and then like
basically our progress
of like uh err gaining skills like I don't know how to say like
to intern like ya
got got intern but my intern is
was in the healthcare side at so it is related to my course
for their events so like it's relevant but the
setting of work or the target audience is not really like
not not that it's not cup of tea it's a good experience
I want to be more fun more young but
at there I'm just stuck with the older audience again and it's more about
what works what works ya I but I
okay lah I do give them quite good things but I'm limited by the fact that it's
the target audience is older so some colour I can't use they'll be more sensitive some font size ya because
if and I feel like a lot of info is inside err like a hospital kan nothing there already
there's bound to be a lot of info lah words so having a lot of bigger fonts
extravagant you know seh I think so so I feel like if I were to be
at somewhere that is more
for for employers also to even hire people now because they lack of you know money to even you know have manpower so right now I don't think it's a very good time to find jobs that
damn sad ah ha we never graduate
exactly
exactly
ya
yes correct correct
can we do you know like because it's not even a good time to think about career at the moment because like your career right now
err they they're all lah whatever uh whatever um like you say food business you you study
cause cause you know a lot of people don't dine can't dine that much all takeaway so it's harder lah basically ya so right now
ya lah like moving forward like right now I don't know what to do lah I feel like I don't now how to say I feel like we shouldn't
err to be so fixated with
do not think so far because I feel like if you think so far you don't think that these kind of things will happen I feel like you should just plan at the things that is
ya lah kan so so I I
oh my god yes oh my god yes yes I feel like I've lost my youth
fun things to do but we can't actually do it because our like I don't know going concert or uh like
oh
you can say relationships are affected in the sense like that I feel lonely I feel lonely
want to see but the like last time the how to say the level of interaction that we have last time and now is so different it affects us
mentally lah ya and I've been seeing all those tweets and everything people are really sad and everything I think largely
is a factor because people don't get to meet people I think that's the most important thing lah like you know like entertainment wise
oh ya correct correct correct
ya
ya
ya
correct correct correct are you an extrovert
mm
mm
how how how
oh
can who say cannot ya I changed also I changed also from extroverted now I'm okay I'm actually no I'm always actually when I took the test
but now is more now since last time I'm ambivert kan but now is more introverted
mm
the thing is ya ya
yes correct correct correct
correct
ya but it has become draining ah but ya sometimes ya it gets draining
correct correct ya correct correct
can relate lah like you have a lot of friends but you just want to hang out with just five of them lah like that like you just don't want to hang out with them you know
I think it affects us ah like if we ever like once the COVID nineteen is done or whatever I think it will be hard to adapt back to how we were you know
ya ya
ya lah
mm I'm just I don't know I feel like okay
so since uh we talk about this COVID nineteen thing eh I feel like I don't know I'm recently very like
upset about the worldly issue that has been going going like black man and everything right
ya ya me too
correct correct what might happen ya I ya but like err
there's a lot of like bombings also um in gaza and everything so it just makes makes how to say ah it's more we get
ya we we don't see it you know
like I feel like now singaporeans start to realise how privileged they are because like we don't have such problems we do have problems
but I'm also quite glad that
I don't know because we have the general election thing and everything so I feel like I think
to talk about sensitive issue minorities and everything so I feel like I hope that
once once the COVID is over or what there will be more err faster I don't know
basically be more open to such issues instead of oh being
close minded that kind of thing just because the government doesn't talk about it but now I realise oh actually
wow we are like ya sia we think we think singaporeans we're like smart and everything but no seh I think
I think I realise that a lot of us like as a nation we lack empathy to
ya to such matters ah
yes correct
older generation ya
mindset ya
ya
yes correct correct correct
especially like you said the older generation they don't agree a lot to our
younger people people's view or or take on on how it should be or what because they think they're like
older and everything but I think it's because they're too ingrained like their traditional values is too
ya
I I I I'm quite
I'm quite glad ah like you know cause like
err I like I have faith lah
for like this
will be a better country for the people lah not just for economic
like it has a certain
image that it wants to capture like how it's very
green eco green very luxurious expensive but
we have a lot of
what is it called
flaws ah
that we ya but ya lah I just hope that things change lah
ya so right now what's important right now is I'm hungry
like just now I eat what did I eat just now let me think
err what did I eat ah oh I eat fatty bom bom
but is a new the new outlet at uh east
at my bedok that bedok heartbeat it open a
it was meh but
maybe because I didn't choose the nice one
thing lah some like wah quite heng lah then I'm like
chill ah I'll just eat ah I'm
but their mashed potato nice sia I like seh
it's western everything is western lah with pasta and rice and everything
oh my god
no but then like it's true like after this I'm going to eat I hope
ya we have to eat you know so I don't know
speaking of it eh what you eat just now ah
what what oh porridge nice meh
you like you like porridge ah
oh okay
not bad ah
wow
now I feel like cause I've been wanting to eat breakfast Mac McBreakfast sia
ya we don't I don't
ya but I wake up
there's there's a ten minutes break
it's not a shift ah it's err like
ya it's uh eight to five it's not a shift
there's one hour break lah
but like but like I have a ten minutes before if I
if we bring bread or what you can eat at that point of time or buy something
but the thing is I want to buy but I've to wake up early and you know me
mcgriddle
ya but I've been wanting to buy it just now but then I was
like shit it's too early and then I was like shit but I I miss I
like other timing kan like it's not always like a constant err
fixed menu right why ah why they do that ah what
oh oh ah I like heavy because if I eat light I will shit
and then okay basically ah I don't know maybe got something wrong with me ah
but the thing is if I eat something heavy or what it will be okay I don't know what's wrong with me but like
I think they have the plain one the plain one is my
okay so
uh huh now I hungry sia shit
okay so
what time did we came here ah
eight
no like in this
contraption
okay okay so I'm eighteen
ya we met in poly
cause mm
interest group ah
ya
okay ah okay ah okay
okay it's okay don't worry don't worry okay
where do we where do I start
okay so okay I
springfield secondary
ya so I
oh you didn't know oh okay
ya so I started with sports okay but I bored of it anyway ya floorball then ah ya
four years ah
yes correct from sec one
C division I think we got second then B division we got second
I I I became the captain I think
ya it was like shocking because
okay
I'm like quite a perfectionist
so last time uh I'm not good at floorball but there were like
so I thought that maybe this is the chance to learn a new sport
so you know what I did
okay basically I didn't have the stick and everything I didn't have the funds
then ya I I I
it's the not the wooden one it's the screw-able
that one ya I took it out then I use hanger the steel hanger
to form the shape of the blade
ya then after that I wrap it in wrap the blade
in in tape
as thick as possible then I attach it to the ya to the
I I practise at home I did once bring it at school but uh
ah but if I don't remember but I showed them okay maybe not maybe not
at all because it's circle it's very thick and everything
like it was swollen
ya
ya because it's the training stick ah the not so good one but training stick
ah I bought lah using but that's when they they told me you can buy using ah what is it called ah last time
medisave eh medisave no medisave edusave medisave edusave edusave aiyo ah
education whatever thing lah then like
ya lah then I once I bought the stick I practise almost everyday
I flunk my grades literally
because I practise every day I stay back at school ya I prioritise that uh because I
everytime I try to shoot kan the ball will always roll on the floor
it's there's a there's a boy and a girl but we don't mix the trainings ah unless the stupid teacher wants ah
but that's err that's another story lah but like
ya so I train train train train train
and then I I think my teacher noticed or something like that
then I think that's why I became the floorball captain or some shit like that
ya because I trained on my own timing that kind of thing
and I actually got better I actually got better
ya but I failed my grades lor but
it's okay lah I got to be the captain lah so once I did
I
I don't know felt nice but I felt unrecognised
so okay for me I find I'm ugly ah
I'm ugly back then ah honestly ah among the girls and most of the pretty girls already
know how to play floorball
so people expected that they would be one of the ones that will get the position lah
so when I got it because I was really an outcast
not they don't dislike me but I felt
a certain of like acceptance
no acceptance because because me and my friend one side only
to do all thing but once I got to be the captain or announced as the captain
they started like asking me like to join them and everything but I also ask my friend
who were outcasted to join me ah that's how the the team bond ah
ya but then my secondary school like quite dramatic also ah I'm sure your one also dramatic right
oh
oh okay
you you involved
oh
I'm okay with you
oh
okay I'm quite
quite surprising seh to find out that your most drama life was in poly
class drama okay I think
mm
that's good lah because for me I'm involved in it because of the people I know
the floorball drama is I'm not involved in it but it's just that you know
there's a lot of rumours about very petty lah just about girls being pretty then
they date date they date date date date and everything
yes so
so I'm not involved in in it anyway it's just like that kind of thing but I also do
stay away lah from them but then if you want to get the team together you kind of have to
kind of get on their good side so that they can listen to you that kind of thing so
but it went well lah because we're the most bonded
team ah because we didn't like the seniors the seniors very stuck up
they think they're good and everything but we got the most achievements
so we're like leh we're a better batch
ya we were the junior team
and we brought a lot of medals ah
ya so
secondary school was fun and everything then I like failed math then I'm like
okay so what's next so
so I go and do then after that oh I oh design don't need math
uh my science also but it was a D seven I think it's a pass but my math was the one ah
but then I was I chose a design school so it didn't matter that much I guess
my language was okay
so now ah that's how I got into ford lor
ya
that's what I was thinking cause
uh I heard a lot about like drama
uh huh floorball specifically
so actually I was quite burnt out being the captain and
err I don't know just very tiring so for me to go there
and continue it and imagine like it's far it's far then training
that's man I was like
time for a switch up let's go volunteering
in smart asia lah
cause ah my friend also lah cause her friend is in
is the vice president but eh president so she asked me to join the team
and I also wanted to do something
volunteering because I wanted to add on also to my to my
life skill and resume or something like that lah so
I damn burnt out by sports it's I'm bored of it lah basically
how to say ah I actually I love sport
but it took a toll on me because
I had to buy the equipment and and and I'm not so well off too at that point of time to buy
ya it's like a burden ah for my parents to keep buying me shoes and all so I
think
I could come back to it if I want to because
after my secondary school right I actually join external club
ya I actually joined eh few seasons and all but the trainings were right after school and like
so that made me like wah another commitment
but it was already after um
oh haven't it was O-level I forgot then I quit then I quit then I quit then I quit then after that
they asked to come back again that's why I was like no I no to the club
it's um I just feel like I have the passion for it but
it's not what I want to do in the end so
maybe not my passion ah but you get what I mean I don't know me as a person I like to try everything and I want to do
good in everything and that's me lah but that's the thing lah I can't focus on one thing lah
right now it's not I think it's becoming popular
so
it's becoming popular because we're good at it I think now ya we're good at it we came in
the asia games we came in third or second that's not bad ah honestly
but national wise um don't know yet lah but I think not bad lah
not bad I think not bad ah honestly not bad ah
ya but if you if you were in it I think you will know the there's competition to watch
same like other lah
so ya lah I decided to do the volunteering thing then of course I met you lah that's how I met you lah
like
I don't know I was so nervous actually because like
it was such a weird
like
it's not weird lah it's like
it didn't feel like everybody was there for the same thing
it's like do you get what I mean I don't know how to say like some just join because this is the most chillest
kind of kind of thing but some join okay of course I want to help and everything
then
and then like
ya I didn't know you that much ah I think the only time I actually got to know you was during the camp
the smart asia camps right

I thought I thought you I don't know eh I was kind of scared of you lah
I feel like you like a
legit legit legit legit but actually you're very friendly
not like not like you look lah but then you
have the vibes but you're quite smiley lah so
ya but then I also
not I also don't mind also

smart asia was the most randomest
thing ever
quite a lot right
kan in fact
flower actually everything actually almost all
err you did the flowers for the mother's day

I feel like end up right
we'll always be the last ones to stay back and last ones to do the thing cause we're the organisers of the thing
correct correct
yes correct correct
but we're trying to
the worst I feel like the worst is the camp
because we didn't make our camp remember we made the dance night last minute
because nobody actually wanted to go it's only like five people seven people
then like wah damn sad eh
because I feel like
I don't know like I said I think
people were there for different reasons not particularly to commit to it ah
they just want to have a so like
oh there's actually point incentives to do let's join this one instead and get
point system or something like that
so ya lah I think it was fun lah
but it was like really the really feels like a like a amongst us kind of
like we're the cause we're a part of the EXCO mah then we're just like
let's okay let guys um we plan plan plan plan guys what do you think great great
it's just us deciding among each other you know that kind of thing ya
ya then I don't know
if you would rate your okay nevermind let me think properly
which is the best
experience of
tertiary education
no no no not okay education which stage
is the most ah ya ya ya which stage is the most exciting to you
mm meh
okay lah
happiest unproblematic yes
okay okay okay yes yes yes
okay
oh okay
yes oh my god
mmhmm
okay
okay
oh there's such thing ah okay I didn't know leh
oo
I was quite popular in various gorgeous for being like the top housekeeper like I don't know why but like our sports the there is like even and rope skipping sector where it
wow got vision this is a sport
mm
oh my god you so pro seh
while skipping
wow pro seh
mm
wow
uh huh uh huh uh huh
ya that's why mm
okay
wow
but
it's with music ah usually the competition
oh my gosh
ya
oo
oh
wait so so
oh okay
ya ya ya ya ya
uh huh
seh lah oh
oo okay
is it not your passion also
for fun lah mm
I I also only started dancing
ya but not good
I like free styling but I don't know they keep
every I know can do K-pop ah you know
I free style a lot but but at first I look stupid lah
ya I don't know why I found myself good at it later I show you lah the video
but don't judge don't judge me ah I I no training but like
ya so now so meaning
ya ya
okay
oh
it's like but fast and sync
ah you like the kind lah
ah
okay
mm
mm
it's so
oh
oh not bad ah
okay okay
if win win lah you lose ya
forte kind of thing
okay
oh okay
mm
oh so there's
oh shit
aiyo
mm okay
not supportive ah
oh
oh okay
oh okay
but you got you work a lot of you work ah ya lah
oh
mm mm
aiya
okay
but you made it though
ya ya
mm
that's quite interesting flow of experiences
primary
not really
mm
you did ah
my eh my also same
eh I kind of want to but I don't know what course
but the thing is I also don't know there is there is but the design is very specific
your what going to design very emotional design graphic graphic design
video video so I don't know what I exactly want
ya it can be also content design
or data I don't know lah a lot of stuff lah they want specialist specialist
I actually want to be a creative director
ya meaning
if there's a project visually I'm I I'm in charge
so let's say it's a photoshoot let's say it's a photoshoot
if I'm the creative director
the props is me the concept is me
that kind of thing ah so you can if you're a graphic designer
you can the it's more production
but if you start from designer also can because you already have the visually your own
own kind of taste and everything then you can put the element inside
production okay for example I'm trying to think of
a concept yes okay let's say creative creative creative director um
I'm the creative director of
so the show the art direction of the show the concept of the show
is up to me
can can be
can be small can be big ya can be small can be big um
it can be magazine creative director so can apply for a lot of stuff
so
but creative director is you need a lot of you need to know your shit lah basically
you need to like you worked with so many people you know so you need to be out a lot of
ya that kind of thing also can but just anything that makes it I don't know I feel like right now
I'm not stuck to one just just try everything see what I like the most
but I'm quite I like media it's just that media is
but I like I want to make my own films
cause in films you can make your own design also what technically
I have but it's only for personal videos ah
not not like a thing thing kan but I can do a lot it's just
you need nowadays you need to be different
like stand out I think so it's hard to have a brand basically to make a brand
but it's okay lah should can lah basically but anyway I'm just saying like
wow I didn't know that you had that err roller coaster of jumping on
a lot of interests and it's very different from each other
ya cause I'm just like
oh that's how you get got into culinary I I'm quite like surprised
I can't believe that like what really everyone
ya what what would you do if it's not
actually you can seh I don't know I think you can eh no but you can eh
but still your design not bad
I think it's not bad it's just that you needed to develop it
but mm
develop which one ya cannot decide which is actually same problem problem with me I also don't know what to focus on
but then they say it's good to be good at everything
that kind of thing
master of none
okay I want to work as a
the end of the day but then not just grades you know but nowadays it's not really about grades so
you know what I mean
that's why
ya but I think nowadays
I don't know how to say adaptability
maybe I'm just being biased but adaptability I think ah poly student will adapt better than a student
which is unfair actually
like they say they say get experience get experience we have experience
oh sorry ah you don't have you don't have a university cert you don't have a cert so sorry ah sorry
then the other person will be like oh uh you're accepted then I'll be like huh why I wasn't accepted
oh the it's not the standard and everything and I'm like oh and they have a higher pay
just because you know unfair quite unfair quite unfair ah
quite unfair ah
the world is unfair but it's fine you know what they you know you know a great person once said
like is unfair so that it is fair to everyone
you know who who said that me
no lah no lah I I made it made it up myself
I think it has to be unfair for everyone so it will be unfair for all so it's like
correct correct
which is why I feel like
it's not fair to judge someone
uh like by how much they work
cause like they always say this
uh if you work hard enough you will get it actually not true eh it's all about chances and opportunities and connections
and that's I feel like the reality of it is true is
it will never be it I don't know ah but it will never be measured by how much you work
is it will always be measured by
it will be controlled by someone who has
the upper hand
that controls how much we work and all cause we will
like how to say you'll never escape
you will always be working under somebody
ya that's why like robot robot robotic
ya but like ya I feel like I don't think
I feel like being rich here I I could be a
that's like the same as me being a evil person
you know what I mean if I'm not fair lah if I'm not fair
labour it's like there's so many chains under
I think humans are the reason why
we don't do well we just
ya
correct
so it be forever like a cycle so humans humans eat other humans lah to survive
where it should be like
I got your back cause I'm a human also I wish people like
a bit more
section
no like more like basically understanding each other instead of
just
uh just see it as it is
like it's a bad thing oh it's a bad thing but there's more to a bad thing the bad thing could be like
oh the person didn't mean it it's by the own circumstances that made it like that you know I mean so
yes correct correct yes
ya
like I've always thought about it like
being good and being bad like
if you have the
capacity to be bad then you have the capacity to be good
if you have the capacity to be good you have the capacity to be bad
so not everyone is good not everyone is bad everyone is just human
kan you can't compare to anyone else because we don't know
we don't know everything ah basically
ya correct ya so we cannot like judge
but then judge is in our nature what

okay
ya I'll open the prompts
okay
then to start with the first question
granted
okay I also wait you think for like one second

the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things lah you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course ah but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that

sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya mm
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor wow
that's first hand right I think my friend bought second hand one
wow like that's a lot of money sia

ya so ya it's so nice like can you imagine like the size of it
no the the land

ya exactly so like
you cannot have what you want to have inside your imagination
so
like if you think about like
golf club
wow
who say I want to buy in singapore

maybe you wanna go like
because like like singapore is like so home and dearly
and then like if you were to like have a house maybe it can just be like a staycation house is staycation is it called staycation
vacation house
but then
ya
uh huh
uh huh
then
oh ya ya ya
very modern
because it's like made out of wood like it's very rare like you know like only like places in indonesia have
I think pulau ubin is a concrete
ya maybe
right what the wood
eh best pe
that'll be so fun
ya you come in to the house you wear slipper
ya so eh you eh what kind of house you wanna actually have
okay okay you realistic
mmhmm landed

ya
ya I understand
true
I don't know leh because now the houses in singapore that's more like like anti overalls like very small so like
mm
ya true
whoa nice nice
jumbo you should try jumbo

mm
ya which area you planning like okay if you were to stay in singapore which part of singapore do you think is the best part to best place to stay at
jurong is west
east ya
you never see the map

so with that gave me a letter
so okay so where where will
more towards the east
mm
north east nearer

super expensive
but then like if you are buying the three room but then like it's small like I mean like last time four and last time
like four room is now's five room

and then after that if you want to talk like realistically
like I wouldn't even spend
more than four hundred thousand
on a house
my whole life paying for the house

the house this house that I'm staying at used to cost like only like one hundred and eighty K
and now it's like
super high eh

serious
and you will be comforted
I'm telling you that I wanted to buy
no it's not lit it's just a book that I read for fun two years ago
you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
he didn't fell in love at first
and then like they help through each other ah but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
oi it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front oh okay I'm sorry I can't remember
remember me

really
what
hais
late night talk late night talk
plagiarism lah
um
if you ever do have a like your own house what type of interior do you want or like what type of vibes do want to get from your house
you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop
well that's the irony there then
ugh I don't want friend you anymore
like I want her I mean him to have his own house like
he's like I don't know he like to sleep like dozen places you know he like to hide under the sofa
you want to come with me
no girl that's just psycho I want like blackout windows
I want blackout curtains so when you close the curtains you cannot see any light at all
you bet I'm going to sleep the whole day girl
why you
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
like last time before was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
oh wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby jungkook now he's so aww
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
oi
why
why not
or condo
why you don't
one why
why then we might as well live with your parents
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
I don't know what I ask her ah and after that she suddenly said like her mum ah did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like oh then why why is she not working because I legit ask ah out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said ah
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very atas lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the that type of lifestyle kan it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
ya
ya
I mean
why
so you don't know insha and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team lah I would have like shouted at her but then oh my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on insha story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then ah
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars
I mean if you do if your diploma is in like in terms of food and recreation or veterinary I think they
that's river safari
but pandas you I think you need like specialised
no the panda bear the polar bear we had died
inuka
did you just sigh oppa gangnam style
but I don't think you like animal
because they they won't talk back to me
but crocodile eat meat
ya ugh human beings
ah
ah
ah
what do you mean us it's just evil humans
they cannot even talk
dog kick
drop kick
ah
um

okay so we are here again
what do you think
he's working at foodpanda so far it's
ya
ya
daniel ah
yes
like if you work for like maybe five hours something like that right
then you can clock in maybe maybe like twenty orders something like that then like per day you can earn ninety
depends ah like

okay

you're twenty nine years old this year would you date her
what the heck
I can tell that you have uh very very no filter
my goodness
and that's something a fact that I wish I could change
err when she want to move ah because the house is bought
but she needs to move out by end of the year I think
eh no no she needs to move out by next she needs to
move out by next year june or march
showed me and mum the other day when I was at her house
because nobody loves you

ya anyway um
we brought madrina in the conversation

or maybe that is a
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to
she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
err a few days
after my birthday ya
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like
couldn't freaking leave me alone then like I was trying to shake him off
can I come the next day
and that stuff
nazri
I can tell I can tell that you you
wow so deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from shura and all my other female friends as possible
mm no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
mm mm maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
is the liberal one is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
oh my god reminds me of the remember when um
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that um
we noticed there was a lot of err people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
jia hui jia xing eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember um
so mister jamal he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
trumpist I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter ah I have no idea lah that trumpet players ah like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world lah like he told us that
err he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because err back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown lah
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that ah
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in err chicago lah
so he would play the trumpet and then his
um his
friend would play the piano
so err I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior lah who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister jamal right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this ah
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts lah
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
err the
like the ah because he was wearing those
err
football jerseys ah like those what cowboys ah patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of kasanaz I'm sure you remember kasanaz
so kasanaz's husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer ah to the point that
they live in singapore but by right kasanaz doesn't need to work
kasanaz is like apparently like got money kind of like girl lah but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something ah like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time ah
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
kasanaz knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that wei xiang is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like wei xiang first of all right
you and me ah
ah both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university lah
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense lah since you like you
somehow educated lah most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties ah who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs ah
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the err the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in lah
so ya lor
I believe he's just a cashier
mm
you know err he used to intern for supply chain for
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
err so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company eh you intern for like a really
big
err
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay lah no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip ah
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also ah
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example temasek right temasek holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance err teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with temasek then we were like bonds ah
you know shares right you can buy like hundred ah
yes so it's really like you need to have money ah
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away lah but
it's a bit sad lah like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan lah the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years ah I have one lah
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money mah and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents ah cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad lah quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what lah those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever lah so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane lah like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue lah
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome ah
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
err
wei xiang was quite a
like not say an advocate lah he was quite a
this at this
restaurant at this then wei xiang didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists uh near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat meh with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no lah so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was uh didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the uh boyfriend was studying ah architecture or something ah
and then the boyfriend he's err
he's got money lah he's rich I forgot what the father does ah
err the father quite strict with the money ah
like I remember the father once said that
err got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten lah then the father got so pissed the father said
err
since you on the aircon after ten right err ah your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
um divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings ah
I don't know
I don't know lah
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so wah talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go jakarta one
second thing right they always go jakarta on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
jakarta right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
dubai or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
mm go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money wei xiang give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them ah but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can lah one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no lah you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be dee kosh
don't prey on kids
seriously dee kosh is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
err okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew lah his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me eh raf want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called lah then he was like oh my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking dee kosh then I'm like huh what you dee kosh wants you to model for him ah he's like no dee kosh wants to suck my then I'm like
eh wait wait wait wait wait eh you don't anyhow hor
then he show me the like the text lah so I was like
you're this guy is insane eh you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am dee kosh your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like oh you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that um
like then later on he'll be like oh like err
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars lah
no obviously I don't know dee kosh I'm telling my friend that
no so um I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal lah hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid lah there are apps and all these mah
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these lah cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people mah like
no one agreed to this ah and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this ah so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as uh you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
a'ah the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said ah is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal lah you can't like solicit sex for cash lah I believe
that is
wrong lah like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong lah I don't know how how wrong it is lah in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due err not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not lah
I don't know right is not a good enough um
answer to to evict you from like err
like
a a sentence ah it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone err he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
err with drugs ah that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge lah he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious meh for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's err it's not a good enough err like what you call it
defence ah the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right ah
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
err lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine lah like the person cannot say because the person lied mah
and the person tricked you into it but dee kosh I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that oh I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only mah
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly lah but like people like
influence ah
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific lah social media influences ah
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle lah
that's between the followers and them ah some people will like ah it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and ah you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense ah like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this lah but we don't empower him to do the things he do mah
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram ah Instagram empowers him lah Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things ah
nicole choo
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is ah the world evolves in this way lah so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition lah everything like happens because something happens mah
so like it's just evolution lah like something ee the previous generation must have done right has created this lah
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it lah I feel like I created monsters
which is true lah I remember she was the first
real socialite lah because before kardashian there was her what
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich eh like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite ah she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families ah like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
um
uh can't really think of any other people like right now lah but
and all of course all your shakes ah
how do I put it lah like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it lah it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes ah to tell people like what they're doing is wrong lah if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it lah like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste lah I personally don't like any of these people lah like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like oh there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no lah I mean if I'm
err I'll go down to town and buy it lah if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges lah what I put inside my bag lah my house
tour lah how much money is in my bank lah my mother underwear what colour lah
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives lah they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in err
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life eh when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
err
an person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is ah it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling ah
no lah the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen

okay hi azli yes and we both of us are um married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say oh automatically I said yes one so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like ah because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
uh condo credit card car and whatever the C lah but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like um like what you want to do when we get married
will be like oh no this one lah
he cannot I already mah so you say that you end up
so when that time when um it was my turn right um I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like um does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually um proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up ah that time we were already like twenty seven I think
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like uh knows um a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
ha decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah
because of the and the right that one all um we we prepare ourselves yes uh I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
uh we all all our by ourself lah
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like um they say it in um
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them ah then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think uh we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars eh I was about to fork out everything eh to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't eh I was actually thanks to
ya because I trust them so much
but then uh at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because uh it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give lah but that time
ah ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways uh it actually works I print exactly lah that's why ah you got extra correct so that time
so uh eventually after that we that's not the only problem ah during our wedding ah actually my greatest fear for uh
quite popular in suria also and uh he's one of the funniest guy ah I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out alah
ya wasted sia it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like walao not on my wedding lah sia
but before our wedding there was this uh issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free lah contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the eventually become better eh best eh until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also uh still wish us and he is like one of the best I feel lah so shout out to azuri and then um
ya our our wedding take place azuri azur but uh the his name is azuri
okay
so ya okay so
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the doesn't show up the
ya
is very much um
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy err better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya
okay so ya make it a drive all right so um is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage ah the wedding ah
oh ya the weather it was nice ah
mm
ya
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
eh
ya
mm
ah
mm
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing ah for you ah for me the luckiest will be the photo ah no no not the photography the photography was good ah the no ya
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing ah that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of um crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
kan ya so just to ask you again but um
we go through like a lot of stuff lah eventually until now even though it's
ya
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
uh marvels uh
um some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
is travelling kan
mm
ya
chey that was a punishment though
eh
I don't know eh oh I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me ah I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry ah because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also lah
no lah but then but
ya
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then um like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that um we wanted to do lah
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
they do their own way marriage lah
ah so that's why lah
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so um
can I just ask you another question ah before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me lah
mm
eventually he is like one okay guy lah so okay lor okay last question
last question lah I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me ah
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding ah marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity uh I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault ah it's your fault but then um there's no such thing as tercheat ah
ter ter there's no such thing as that one for for what I know lah
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me lah
ya correct ah then about uh then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people ah that one
uh never give me stress also because like the thing is that um in-laws right
okay lah still got we we there was a bond there ha and now uh we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
uh we want to create our own family here lah ha
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future um request
as a husband towards me for
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years lah we are already in our
oh my god do I know this
okay I think uh because um for the last past five months eh five years I have been like driving you crazy kan okay the thing is that um
okay ah I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family lah like another um junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that uh another person ah in our family lah kan
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so um I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually uh know
about you more lah
because of the time lah if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that uh to me
I like cooking lah not really into cleaning up ah he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya kan
okay so um that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about

okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber oh my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally sometimes they have like the mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a binaural mic the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
oh my goodness then he was like uh then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself wah is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping oh my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling uh gacha for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn gacha so I can just earn back everything and pull more gacha
then another one they
he what ah he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market lah that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on gacha the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars lah at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
um what ah
uh I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the cup so basically it's like uh an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
no uh fifty thousand yen in is
okay lah six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money lah but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like huh that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot sia is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like anderson and yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay lah my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd lah I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the was so ahead of its time I love playing with the I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what ah
uh shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that one wah that one is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like I like playing him on Smash because eh he quite handsome and his power quite cool
ah I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey kong and he has never failed to turn up with every single eh this company lah this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver ah I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey kong in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on gacha he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey kong's the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title oh I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
ah uh did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that lah
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
oh ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before changsub enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it it was like threatening his the ability to sing ah so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
huh serious
alhamdulillah I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing lah but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
oh
oh serious
mmhmm
I can I I remember but I cannot remember ashraf
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is ah boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically lah but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
huh
heartbreak
oh
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
intense war like thing I probably watched was the
uh what's the one that the Ghibli one
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious ah
bestnya
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying oh my god
when was that before the after war
suay
wah that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
ah okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
hiroshima
karma
wah I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how oh all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
huh
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow ah
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude all the stares what you will literally like stare like nobody's business
oh speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian aceh is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one lah
that's true
huh serious ah
then they said like
uh when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
ugh
ugh
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then uh for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot eh my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know lah it's just okay lah granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever lah it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please lah if they
okay I cannot sorry reform party but did not specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that it's not shahira is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really lah she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
oh
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism

makes sense though
bestnya
I also want to go overseas study
ugh my heart pain yesterday

ah supposedly there is lah but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad lah ya
what
huh
hais can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then
so that's where I learn photoshop lah but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school

ah I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me lah
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me

so mama bear not in all the bears go out today
went already what just now ya he was in office
ya which you quite elated right because of how he looks
ya the company closed down what company is it ah huh
oh jamco
jamco I think
because that time one of like because one of my classmates he's like working for those kind of companies kan the engineering stuff and then he didn't see that they are going through retrenchment soon or something like that at that point of time during our exam so like very busy
why really what you watch big bang theory big bang theory not really
uh
the only the only constant is change
I know ya the only constant thing is change
it is do you do you restart
let's say you were not actually doesn't matter lah
no no no what I meant doesn't matter is just okay did you apply through the app
any customers yet
no no one has reached out to yellow door yoga
Y D Y
yellow door yellow door Y D Y Y Y yellow door
come to yellow yoga
balance
can there's a lot of people doing it so you got to be ya you find a niche what
got no cases what
oh are you hungry
no I have not
well my wife say she'll wake up in the morning for breakfast but apparently she didn't wake up
ah no it's like that
so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
but that one starhub what I don't know
oh
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to lah have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy lah you have to but this one because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
very actually laggy lah the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this one but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software err no it's in english
of course of course it is still on I mean cable cable in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch per say when is the last time you watch
or cinemax or
okay lah
you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course lah
so you have to go down to go to the thing
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language uh
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
it's in
latin form ah so
which one
oh ya
ah no because in october
so because the people the colleagues so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
siala no I just I just told her you try december lah no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay lah november december
I don't know lah but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply lah said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't lah cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on lah even with our colleagues also some of them also huh what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on

mm
mmhmm

mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
oh
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
err you want me to countdown
eight nine eight seven six five four three two one
happy new year

mmhmm
mm
uh it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's uh the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer lah
then uh I have there's a whole checklist of things lah that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
err groceries she have to go to a few uh supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing uh all within her area
so it can be like anything lah depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually err
err do a survey on the product pricing
mm
mm
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result lah responses ah
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say uh one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more lah three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred lah is only but it's the pay is good lah for that time
outlet kan then um
ya
uh price about it it's the same lah because it's the same retailer pe
and then err I had uh my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper lah like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience eh
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything what at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so err it was interesting then after that err
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them lah then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya lah but then no choice what and then is this this is like uh you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also uh
they they know that mean their their company already inform them lah like
maybe informed the manager lah not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing lah they don't say like mystery shopper lah maybe surveyor lah
ah they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one uh uh a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
mm
then too bad lah then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know lah that this week uh got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
uh customer service you know that they can give but then uh other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that lor
mm
mm
mm
mm mm
mm
one year eh
mm
oh my gosh
mm
it's like part time ah
oh
wow
okay
mm
mm
just nice
mm
ya lah
that's why
mm
mm ah ah
mm
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
mm
ya but
wah that's nothing new lah because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game ah
mm
mm
mm
and then like uh my friend was saying ah like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good lah
ya lah no it's more than ten I think
mm
true lah
ya lah
mm
ah
mm
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
mm
oh
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance ah like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only ah
ah
mm
orh
ya lah
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
mm
mm
oh but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
mmhmm
huh
ah
wow lucky sia
hmm mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
ya lah
oh ya
ya ah
mm
ya lah like they have to save cost lah if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like uh reduce the
the
the rental right ya lor
mm mm
why
mmhmm mmhmm
orh okay
mmhmm
uh huh
mm
mm
oh my god
mm
mm
oh so interesting
mm
oh
ah okay
mm
oh
ya lah
mm
ah that's smart
ya lah
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders eh
mm
ya lah ya lah true
mm
oh he's staying alone now is it
mm
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
mm
ya lah true
ya lah ya lah
mm
but it's good lah I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also ah
and then uh we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in eh
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see lah like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then uh don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking lah but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin ah so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and uh and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel uh travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know lah but my whole company is like they freeze travel lah
like for to do travel booking lah visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
mm
mm
ya lah crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing lah basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter eh
from like ah ah headhunter agency eh no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
mm
mm
ya lah
kan I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight ah I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got uh really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya lor makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is uh four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can lah wei cause uh like more senior level lah like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky lah they get a very easy boss
with
eh you never know you know my previous company there's this one err uh E old she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do lah
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
ah yes yes yes they say golden handshake lah but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department eh
because obviously you are being paid too high lah and people have eyes to see what so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall lah like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every uh I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
uh
oh my gosh ya lah she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive lah because she's such she's so rich eh
mm
ya lah
mm
ya lah that's why I was like uh oh my gosh like so some people are so lucky
oh she's been there for a long very long lah usually those uh who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
mm
mm
really ah
mm
mm
ya that time my friend got told me the uh one of her experience kan
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority lah the the boss will give her the supplementary card eh but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever lah whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her uh eh later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like wah so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool lah like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
uh ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's uh he already ask me to pass you I was like
mm
ah ah
uh huh ya
oh
mm
mm
mm
wow
mm
mm
huh
oh my gosh
mm
mm
mm
ya lah at least can just must tell him right
ya lah irritating because usually when they travel it's uh company what so but they can accumulate their own points
haiya
ya lah
oh
mm
mm
ya lah that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing one then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one ah
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right ah okay then we can get the cheapest ah like more less less risk
ya lor
mm mm mm
cannot lah cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because uh it's I think oh that one is because the name
the name is uh typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating seh because we went back and forth then I was telling them like uh when oh no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button ah
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one ah the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name what I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly what
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like oh shit
auto fill so uh I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill lah
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay ah I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited ah no show ah
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
mm luckily like promotion and cheapest eh
oh I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling eh and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then uh after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others lah uh there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight oh
from the company uh book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together ah
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic sia but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore ah
ya lah
kan
ya lah true lah
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane eh
I was like no I just inform the finance uh girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya lah
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
ho chi minh ho chi minh
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats eh no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular eh
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday eh
ah
mm
oh ya ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
so he take ya lah ah that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team kan
no huh
after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious ah but okay lah
after that my friend was like eh I cannot book then I was like eh I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still uh showing available
mm
mm
oh no wonder
mm
mm
eh like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like wah
every time I do travel like so messy seh

huh but
hmm
ya
ya for real
I mean I don't know
it's like bro isn't that the second wave already
ya but I mean the thing is like
you living under a rock
this this few weeks
oh really oh
ya so boring
eh but you know
because of COVID also I'm watching a lot of malay dramas
for real
so perfect I don't know I was so bored ya
the one that I watch
no I don't know why
I know I've never seen that happen before
like when the drama the drama gets halted cause of like
influence
ya one hour one hour for an episode but
I mean ya it was so cute
I know I mean I I understand the show where it's so damn long I swear
yo but my mum watched the drama like six times
ya ya ya exactly
like even if I like a show pun I would like I probably like watch the person inside the show instead you know like I would search up other shows of that person
than watching the show again I cannot even no matter how much I like cannot
for real I slept at I I started at like nine and I slept at nine reading like the fan fiction I'm not kidding
I'm not it was it saudi eh it was in saudi for real
wrong twelve
twelve
it was a series it was a really long series
but it was so cool ah
like the whole as as much as like marvel movies I could watch I really watch all that in order to understand or whatever lah the end game thingy
like fan fiction
but the
hmm
yes
hmm the main main main one the main main ones ah
endgame
like the solo characters the specific characters
hmm
that's why
K drama
what is that
ya

that specific drama or like korean drama in general
hmm
hmm

got romance also
but I only watch but I only watch grey's anatomy I watch chicago med I don't know why I didn't watch
it's similar lah like the same
ya but to be honest I think it'll like K drama ones are better I don't know why
everything about K drama is so cool right
like it's okay to not be okay wah I was so impress
even the settings like
ya like from like basically everytime like the settings like the clothes you wear bro it wow
but is like probably like two a two hundred dollar hoodie you know like there uh so premium quality one just to make it really pretty and really nice
so ya and then I'm like imagine that in malay dramas
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can
hmm true
I don't know
true
I just
I didn't watch it but I saw and I saw kim soo hyun at the end oh my god

okay so I never told you liana or jasmine anything about this but that time I was on a date with this guy we were going
how to say we were going so well we were talking online why are you looking at me like that
okay to be honest I didn't consider it as a date but it was more of an outing okay it was just a outing to get to know each other better ya whatever lah okay so
ugh okay so we were going so well we were talking online and then we decided to go to I believe it was jurong east popeye's you know kan
oh shut down you sengkang ah okay so we were at popeye's and then we were just talking about life we went around oh wait maybe it wasn't in jurong east it was at orchard
orchard kan okay
ya orchard but it was kind of a staple place ah for a date or something like that then
we went uh we just walk around and we talk and I thought it was going so good but the thing is
I thought it was going so good but then after we went our separate ways I saw that he block me on every single social media platform and even my number
I have no idea leh it it was going so well or at least I thought it was going so well I made jokes he laugh he made jokes I laugh
and then after that I couldn't contact him at all you know that's the thing because after that date right usually after every outing I would say thank you ah
thank you for being there maybe maybe you was the jokes he told me
what do you mean okay tell me one joke that I made that isn't settling
the the wing wing joke was so good eh
it it was stupid it's a stupid with you right then a lot of people laugh

eh uh huh
ya ya okay that's true
mmhmm
ah okay
but I'm also specific about whether they are eh yes man or no man you know sometimes guys can be like
ah ya ya ya do whatever you want or like eh no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that I don't want like that ah I want
okay to make it simple I just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time I want a person who can correct me
like if I do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because I'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
ya I want that type of person it will be so sweet
mmhmm
ya
ya
ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me ah
that that sounds so wrong eh
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy I know a lot of man who would say
oh this girl is too picky for saying like that if I see these online and then I'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl leh
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky I always feel like that not lucky pe seh but like that time in
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like wahseh so cute
huh really
ah
oh my god are you serious
ya huh
ya
uh huh
maybe maybe he was acting cool you know like those big macho guys like oh my god girl loves me they say the inside themselves
but then you know but then on the inside there also like what the heck this girl likes me she's crazy

they ya they already separate then suddenly when the guy wants to be with another girl suddenly the ex girlfriend came running back
why you are you with girl why you with this girl blah blah blah blah then I was like what seh this huh
when he told me the story I was so confused wasn't she not with him anymore and the thing is right she broke up with him ya ya ya ya
wah
okay like ya after that um once I got to know the story of course I cannot confront her right because I not I not in their relationship what
and but the thing is I don't know how
I got roped into this drama and somehow the girl thought the guy was cheating on her with me
ya ya that's true
because we did we did clarify it with them
the girlfriend lah I'm not I'm not so sure what's happening with her but

alright
ya
mmhmm
what
I feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest ah of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing eh we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say eh don't do it don't do that leh like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then I don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace err
mmhmm
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
uh huh
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed pe
mmhmm what is on your plate
uh huh
nine thirty as it wait what time do you start work again
what life this girl my my office hour starts at eight leh
okay ah wait how long does it take for you to get home let's say you from the office ah
okay fine wait but that's the same timing I have ah to get home
uh huh
you know what topic I'm interested in talking about our good friend J J J J J
no
our good friend jannah
you know we're we're talking about the relationship topic just now right I suddenly remembered her it remember when we went to her house
huh no no no
does she know know not that I know but I feel like I want to find someone for her someone special
I have no idea but you know lah like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
I would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and I feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time I want to find someone for her but I feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her leh it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
I know you don't have a lot of friends
what do you have
but do you have anyone in mind maybe your cousin your your your boyfriend's friend
how about allan friends allan's cousins allan family is huge eh
oh my god ya that's you know what this is is a this is a hard thing to do we want to find someone good for her but at the same time we feel like our friends aren't good enough for her
so how she's already up there shaza
oh
ya she deserves better than me to be honest okay K K we all deserve the best woo feminism power hashtag girl power
mm mm
elections I
oh I don't really care too much about it but I do stay up to date sometimes what about it
hmm
ya correct correct and the thing is I feel like um to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya uh huh
ya oh ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course lah their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then I guess lah it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and I I also think that most of them are like or I don't want to get involved in politics so I don't want to vote for anyone you get what I mean
ya correct correct but
nowadays kan everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
I I saw I saw these two video ah it's like satire and then it's basically ah
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain
ya
wait wait work culture or walk oh woke culture no I never heard of that leh
mmhmm
a'ah
suit so
like in ah if so basically we just have to be careful with whatever we say is it like right now I'm talking to you oh I feel like blah blah blah but blah blah but blah blah so I have to keep adding in defending points lah
but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay I feel like I understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman
then talk about rapists and stuff like that then suddenly got some guy in the comments
what about man man also will get ah okay I understand now what lah these people
mmhmm
yes
eh sorry
equity
as in as in financial management equity
equity
a'ah
ah okay okay okay ya
mmhmm
A two
oh unbelievable oh uh uh ya
alhamdulillah
that's true ya okay what is the most fun aspect or memory about that you have
ya ya
that's true
ya ya ya ya
they do ya they do care about us until now they do care about us
ya it is not an obligation to them right for them it's just a natural thing to do
oh my god I knew that mah ya
okay
okay like you already recall right these fun times you or like those non-judgmental times you had in and we will remember this is the most non-judgmental thing you remember or not we were in and then um
basically the girls can put colours in their hair they can
ah I don't know dress ah wear like outstanding jackets and then the guys would taper their pants I don't know in in those little ways it just shows their
their how to say ah their creativity their expressions and oh my god that's so good
ya
yes
miss judy and mister farhan to be honest
yes we really didn't like them
ya but I get you we we didn't really like them because I I have no idea I guess we weren't used to people being harsh to us we were still babies you know we were from secondary school and stuff like that
and ya and ya basically we didn't get to be scolded most of the time so once we got scolded by them
we we felt attacked in a way
um yes
is this relatable woman she you remember when she said that she would drink with most as we some of the seniors like after they graduate of course at the right age remember that drinking isn't responsible before the right age
ya mmhmm
was ya one of the best times of my life though
yes ya
uh huh
err
it's okay it's fine
mmhmm
ah oh oh my god
it's the sisterly affection oh like oh my god that made me recall something
ya
miss really I am not lesbian I have nothing against lesbian I like girls but as at a certain there's a limit to it I like boys I really liked boys thank you for your concern
I think I think mister alan was the one who told her because um our first lesson for that day we was with mister alan ya ya I guess okay I I guess I put myself up to it ah cause my sleeves was wore right and the blood was like dripping but I cannot do anything over it if
no the thing is if I wanted to fix my scarf right I would be late for school and you know instead of being late for
school I'd rather go ah go to school on time and let myself bleed to death that's a natural thing to do
oh my god you believe that story how lah correct correct okay
I
everyone knows that story was fake lady
oh
okay let me tell you ah the the real story was that I was fighting with my cats
I was fighting with my cats because they were fighting each other I naturally put my hand there right ya it's why cat
I'm not lying to you now I only lied to you two to three years ago but everyone knows that was a fake story okay everyone knows
okay ya so I was I was there ah and you you know you always talk to your cats right ya I always talk to my cats like the humans so I'm like
stop it lah what the hell stop stop stop stop stop then I put my hand in between them then one of them
oh got caught caught or
what is it what is it called they they hook my hand basically they wrap themselves around my hand then they kick then they bite also then my hand started bleeding ah
because they follow the owner I'm their owner so if I'm aggressive I'm an aggressive person ya aggressive also but they are sweet too so which means I'm sweet ah
then ya so basically I put my hand to between them and then they scratched me and I cannot do anything about it I'll just
decided or I'll just wash a bit then I go to school lah I go to school then mister alan thought I was suicidal weak weak
mister alan did have you seen this snapchat picture I I merge his face with mine
no no no no as in you know snapchat we could merge our face I put my face with his face right
it was the perfect match I look like mister alan in a young girl's body and I felt
weird later I will send you ya okay to sum sum it all up I guess woo poly aww
I feel like ya I feel like going back right I had I don't know
I want to kit from there the kits that are so pretty and so cheap
I I guess so I don't know I guess ya and then but the thing is I feel like we should also move on lah

mm

hey nurul
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right mm
what is your ideal vacation like
oh for me kan I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
ya lah for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
this small staff lah these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya oh mm so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because uh
it's to me it's one of a kind ah and then like uh so many different
see experience all the different species in one area lah in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the kampung glam area
ya about the old school stuff like uh sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya oh ya and I want to know mm which genre of drama or show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like err
drama like between people I mean I prefer uh movies lah because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
and then like after that uh
um oh there are some reality shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun oh then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
uh it's called kahani ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that um
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so err ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
yes
ya so like eh I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
oh what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
mm
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch um
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important lah so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
ya so very cool cartoons lah and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first uh
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
um
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
orh ya lah soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like oh he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the ah every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
oh I like this question because I like wishes
uh
oh not a lot of people will say food why why why food
mm
unusual superpowers wah I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya lah that's that's what I want to
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think uh the reading about minds one sometimes uh I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is um
actually why one thing ah why cannot be many things I say education ya
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
oh if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that uh people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
eh then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like oh it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
wah so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun lah
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like wah how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
say if I were to play like music or like uh art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true oh then I wanna ask um
mm
think for me mm
four episodes ya and then err the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
to this place
for me I really love concerts leh like it's too bad lah this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
uh then like mm
for me kan my uh
a higher price
ya lah so like for me uh
as a frequent concert goer kan you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that oh my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
think for me my fashion style I always like to uh dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then uh if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and err I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me kan uh
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
so like err personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
ya what is it
I think this one eh your hardest question eh how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like um say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me uh just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
oh I was thinking
mm korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
chey cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane lah so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as uh language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
like eh quite cool leh like oh and then like uh ya I like
to actually I like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
oh that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower lah but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right wah they were so cool
ya
very cool and like um
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see um err what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then err
so ya lah I really like flowers I also like plant I like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool

friends lah I I know it's important but then uh friends that can can I think I mean can really together sit with you uh uh I mean like you can share things together
oh yes uh I'm more like want to have a peace of mind lah just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think uh because uh we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this uh the ten years time is to whereby I would like uh you know um
um
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
ah ah ah like for you how
there will be new one I let go
um
mm
mm mm
mm
so meaning that ah
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty lah so at that age you
you still want to like uh you know pursue your interest
uh in science
okay
mm mm
okay
uh if there was a drama kan um I mean I like to watch action movie lah actually
ya cause action movie
working but then you you
you really like um awake that means you're really awake and you are like uh
you are you are really amazed you know amazed
ya stimulated and you are really amazed by their their skills lah
ah
yes correct uh correct
scenario settings uh you know once in a while okay lah once in a while ya
how about you
what kind of uh genre did you like to watch
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay okay
mmhmm mm
mmhmm
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no lah that one is different question
mmhmm
uh I think fit body lah better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina uh you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors lah okay I mean like everyday life also lah we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important lah
yes correct correct
ya correct of course um of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks uh you know ah people say you have it's naturally
it is naturally lah like that
so what will you think
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
ya
ya so you see eh like nowadays generation you can see the different generation eh how they are very um they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
but then they they they always ah you know
that is only external but not internal you see ah this is what they they forgot lah so I think um
mm
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm okay because I think about mental health ah it has to be
uh
ah that any friends that you think that uh that support you and any friends that you that uh you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself lah whatever so that it doesn't when you have a problem you don't bottle up
ah at least at least you have uh somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming
mmhmm mmhmm
ah
mm
mmhmm
correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm mm
mmhmm mm
mmhmm mm mm
I think ya it's true it's true I think that um okay when you talking about the schools eh um
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being ah they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
can take the stress so you cannot push them further lah
ah because ah
correct
correct
correct
ya
correct correct
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
ya lah ya lah
ya lah ya lah ya lah
where would I want to go
mm
children days are really a a days that memorable days lah I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like uh like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of uh like childhood memories lah childhood fond memories but like as for me
uh as a kid ah ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep ah that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody lah have their own good childhood memories
so how about you
oh okay
mm
mm
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
mmhmm
um
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
mm
mm
uh three wishes eh
um okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is uh
a healthy life lah
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then um
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children eh when they are in need children in hunger ah you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think um a bit sensitive to their situation
okay then the third one the third one the third one uh the third one
what is it ah third one ah
mm
like for me right I think the other wish is that mm
but um
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy lah healthy body and healthy mind
uh and then the the best part is uh good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good uh behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
um respect others
uh yes then um the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important lah
uh to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
I I just hope lah that my children are not like that and then uh I just hope that whatever that my children do they must uh always think that life is really temporary
uh in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there um
ah that is my my wishes lah I I think for my for my children
for my children
mm
yes correct no I mean uh of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
ah you see
ya no
mm
mm
okay
mm
ya
ya
there is uh good and bad lah we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first eh
see ah there there is a good and bad lah when talking about phones okay uh cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
ah you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy lah and everything information at the fingertips but
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
the I mean it's difficult lah to control it is more I think challenging
ah now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control ah you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy lah it's not really easy
mm it's not really easy
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
mm
ya correct
mm
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the
ah so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
um you see
ya I mean mean of of course
mm
mm ah ah then after that
ya
ya
wah I think ah I think with this right people will have develop more mental health problem

ah

oh world of married
what is it about
oh
oh
mm
oh
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like Syamsul Yusof right
I feel very sad for him seh cause like he's like my favourite
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life seh
hmm
but I don't know eh cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then um
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
uh children I think one of it
uh is a guy one is a girl
then um I know Puteri uh which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
uh divorce right
it really shows that
maybe Syamsul did something ah but I don't know seh
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like um
marriage and everything
and then actually uh on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick eh but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
wah if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
seh like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than um
like Syamsul Yusof all right
I also remember got this
I think
you know Alif Aziz
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like Alif is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
of loving someone who is
toxic
why but then bella was saying like oh
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
I feel I don't feel um
um scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
mm
but I think it's also because um he
I mean the other girls were like not even
um saying sorry or anything
oh your hair
um I don't know seh I think you should just
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya so you should just go for it ah
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
ah
from ten to to eh
ya
but I have a lot to do so
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
uh okay lah but like I feel like food is nicer
ah which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
foodpanda or what ah
ya
oh my dance classes eh
um
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
mmhmm
then isn't it better
oh ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay lah
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
maybe but like I feel that everyone
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they chiong last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I chiong last minute but they all very studious like
three
or week four
I don't know seh
but ya and then
oh did I tell you I met
uh our soccer friends
ah our captain remember
ya
ya the same place as me ah
ah my our campus is
ah Dover
ya
ya oh my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
is like a
a website ah where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review ah
ya and I thought of buying it ah cause like
I feel like
mmhmm
why fifty dollar quite a lot what
oh
but I think in your
because you only receive like nine hundred ah spending money how to save
ya
eh I feel that the money that you have
spend for the month
but like maybe okay lah not that
direct nine hundred ah but like
those kind of thing
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
mm I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
orh for Anas eh
ya I mean I feel for Anas right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple eh
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
because
ya you can buy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even Dakshah had to ask him out
mm
ya that's true
depends ah
uh a bit of physics but other than that no
oh did mama tell you that
oh
mm
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also lah I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
um
doesn't work that way you know
oh he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
oh he did huh what did he do
oh
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
orh but how much were you paid per month
huh fifty jer
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
oh my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya lah you can say like oh you want to help the child everything but wow
that progress and also the time spent right
but really marks where you can go
the place where you
make it or break it seh
ya I mean
minahish and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
it's really scary
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
um the
scary ah that how young and how brave are you to do that
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it seh like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever seh
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then they just um try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
secondary school
oh but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
oh
oh my gosh okay
ah why he like that seh
you reminded me of our netball coach
how old was she ah when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
wah early twenties then she act until like that
oh
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
oh when was I there
oh
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with seh
mm
oh my god ya it was during like the
um
exam kan
I mean how we've been overworked
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
oh I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her oh my god
err
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma lah to be honest
mm
so supportive and stuff
ya
I
I don't know if you know this Instagram ah it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
ya
ya
wilt wilted eh
wilting eh
ya
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal lah but then
they brew their coffee eh no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
a'ah Singapore
huh why you ask me that
oh um
haiya for me
hmm let me think
actually
I know that
like if especially if my husband wants a child
ya
I mean like you can always say oh I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
that's why
ah
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head ah
ah
ya
I I don't know ah
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
you love cats
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
mm
that's why
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment ah it's like why would you keep them there seh
oh actually ah
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
oh
mmhmm
I mean those are just news lah I feel that Singapore zoo is like still having some efforts also what
orh
uh huh
I'm pretty sure the animals are being fed and everything
don't worry lah
spa seh I feel like my whole body
is aching
ya
ya
I really want to go
but then like you know what I think my birthday right I want to go for a spa
ah flower bath
ya I want to go for flower bath
I scared is um what do you call it
hmm
ya actually

okay
alright
ah
tenet
okay ah basically he borrowed money without my knowledge
this is less still shady ah
I don't know who
thing is
what
whether
damn
ya
ya
ya
basically like he was caught in the crossfire lah
once in the
ah
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
you tell
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
last month last month not a lot lah close to one thousand
yup that's it ah
at least that's the only thing I know of ah
uh his credit rating is bad
I think he needed money ah
ya
oh that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
don't do this ah
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
you know right not the end of this month next month lah cause our initial agreement was six months what
uh next year
friend ah
no one listens to me kan
the voice of reason
ya
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care ah that kind of thing ah
ya
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
actually by end of this month
but
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
but
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed ah
rightfully so ah to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
you have a place to go but you rather not ah
that kind of situation ah
ya basically lah same thing ah
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it ah
but
now seeing this
you know
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend ah rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
I have
I have
eh
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know oh but
you know people are driven by greed what some people do not know how to control their greed
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you what
um
ya he left
uh some cash cause I don't know ah he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
mm
mm
ya
ya
alright
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap ah
okay
so
mm
sort of
fahim no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know lah whether
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl lah
I mean technically there is a plague going on ah
okay
okay
mm
mm
okay
hmm
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably lah eh
mm
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does tau maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
ah
ya ya like it it's inside lah and so it's called what you said is right correct pe
ya
why you were there lah at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
be a part of it lah cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend ah
um
in a moral dilemma every time
that
you know I don't feel good that she's there
it doesn't feel right what
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that oh I'm approving this ah it feels wrong ah
so it puts us in a tough spot ah
back then ah
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical farid lah
like shadow boy shadow boy
I think eight years
oh
okay
mm
what the
okay
hmm
loco ah
I wouldn't
know what
she's gonna be there
it came to a point where if riz there she's there
so we knew what to expect ah
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
um from what I see eh
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs ah maybe she fulfils both not sure
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here ah ah the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him ah
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks ah
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all lah definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
not saying that it's super common lah no lah just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
ah recklessness um
probably lack of ambition
ah ya privilege ah ya lah
usually
usually lah generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things ah
generally speaking ah
so based and on that
um
scenario like you always quite common ah for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible lah I'm not saying that
bad point would be
or fittest lah even
not not even the fittest man alive ah
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
oh did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already lah
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist ah
it's nonsense
ya
sial lah brunei
ya
mm
oh is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
mm
oh
mm
ya ya ya
okay let's just call them government eh
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism ah
for investment
attack tourism ah
yup that that's the thing
country
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia lah but still quite bad lah
if you look at the ah if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free lah it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
ah then uni isn't free
ya it should be lah or very heavily subsidise ah
but it's not okay ah let's talk about
oh so just now you wanted
to ask about
oh khai right
ya
anything lah
ya
oh
more
when it comes to that and
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her lah
too trivial lah to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
you know how we talk kan
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
something like that lah
oh mistress
well he consented to it lah so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know ah
then she slimmer
ya
if you want to do this
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out wai was the one who needed help
so ya
I mean that's why he deal lah him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant lah rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married lah if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her lah personally
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
ya probably yup
oh six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
fifty percent is fine what it's both of your kid anyway
ya
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it lah
the rest I have to iron
yes exactly
oh okay ah
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
safwan told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
his name is saifuddin
then zafran I think zafran has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her lah
so I don't know
oh when life is good
eh
I'm on a
the frequency of how how I eat
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult ah
huh
I ate at four
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
when we started going to the gym
ah still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on ah
healthy ah range
but ah same lah
a
ya louder that ah
true
didn't factor that in ah
sial lah
err should be more
actually should use the malaysia malaysia one
eh should be more accurate for malay
sial ah
ah yes
one six seven
you're going to do it now
of what obesity
ya average or healthy ah
ya
wah slightly above average ah okay pe
okay lah
chonky
ya I remember
I remember
absolute unit ah
I think the heaviest I was I think lah cause I didn't check my weight for very long time think seventy I think so then it was it was good lah that that I went for the christmas dinner
I should do something about it lah
then it was difficult lah initially very difficult
then
no no no no
yup

mm which eh
as long as you are happy ah
of course ah
when I was in school that's what I learn myself sia B
nobody's gonna teach you this kind of nonsense sia
err I don't know lah they they they I think they don't believe in it ah but for me is I believe in it because build rapport you know why you know why I say this thing is good or not

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
ah
ah okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
mm
okay
but you can cook what
okay
mm
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
mm
mm
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
uh good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
mm
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
mmhmm
ya
okay
mm okay
okay
can so
mm
mm
mm
mm
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
mm
okay
mm
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
um
err
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
mm
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
mm
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
mm
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
uh huh paddy field
swan
no not flamingo
flamingo
crane eh
crane
and
and did you like it
mmhmm
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say one ah
don't take back on your promise ah
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
oh
okay
uh huh
okay do you have any
mm
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
okay
disney pixar lah
then you did did you watch incredibles two
mm
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
mmhmm
oh okay okay
then the storyline
mm okay
mm
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
mmhmm okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
mm okay
mm
then
so if you were to
mm
uh huh
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for err err single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal lah his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master err their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no lah professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research what like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it lah and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing lah because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different what
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different err
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
mm
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education what
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early lah because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also mah
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
eh teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
huh go
after I graduate go
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing lah and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
mmhmm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
mm
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
anything lah ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
uh huh
mmhmm
okay
okay
okay
mm actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
mmhmm
ya
mm
okay
mm
okay then
so
if
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
okay right
yio chu kang all the way
okay
how much are you paying
mmhmm
hundred and seventy seven
okay
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay
mmhmm
okay
oh
ya
mm
okay
there's active what
ya
ya
no not pilates lah aerobics
no not aerobics cardio
because
twelve classes
ya group class so uh ya lah so had three class and then because of COVID
ya
okay
ya
ya
mm
okay
ya lah just go for the active one is cheaper lah
ya
mm
mm
ya
I think
ya
I think there is should
but jalan besar maybe
ya have you gone for any active you never gone for you have never gone for an active classes
mmhmm
oh the one at jalan besar swimming pool
uh huh
okay
also very far
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay

you were uh
mm
okay
mmhmm
okay
so you are improving lah
then are you still going for classes now
mmhmm
okay
okay okay
mmhmm
okay then
err
hmm
what
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
so you will eat bread toast for breakfast dinner lunch everyday for the rest of your life
ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
uh huh
mm ya
okay so what would it be
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
mm
me
why
it's not filling what
if I were to eat one dish for the rest of my life
maybe fried rice
ya
or your mee hoon
the the the dry mee hoon
ya that's the
one dish I will eat for the rest of my life
but it must be dry cannot be the wet mee hoon
okay
hmm
so
mandi rice mm
yesterday
come you you try to smoke it but
I don't know I couldn't taste the smoky flavour or anything
ya and that's what I said what the smokiness
ya the smokiness was only on the skin
uh
ya
uh ya lah
mm
okay lah I mean
it's a normal
I can't remember if you made better mandi rice or not
ya
ya do you stuffed it right
ya
mm
when you try to make like with briyani or mandi I like I prefer
when you make simple ghee rice
with like chicken curry and papadum
is either a hit or miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work
ya ya
okay lah it's not that bad also it was still good
decent
nex
ya
half half
we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know lah mm mm is to cater to people
so things to let people
have a bit more variety lah
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza uh
the biggest one
it's very filling
ya
mm
okay
then tomorrow what are you making
reheat the mandi rice
with ghee rice
okay you should teach you should teach me uh how to make ghee rice

so that's what you are making tomorrow
mmhmm
ya
no it's okay
mm
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring um rice we can bring prep rice cooker
uh huh
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can uh I think you just bring to the room and
ya
or stew
ya no lah it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more what
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back what
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say what monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months what it's just one semester six months
oh eh not six months lah three months of school
so
no school uh just come back uh three months later
ya
she's working in what
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
mm so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies lah
so ya she already graduated what she she no no and then
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working lah and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that lah to make money
ya
ya kan just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland ah
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature what
it's more it's less
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries what
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
uh but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
uh huh
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you eh school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
no I don't want go ah
we don't have relatives there
I don't know I think it's something related to

close one eye lah eh
I can close one eye lah it is up to you lah you want you want that okay lah fine lah
but please do not disturb my
pasting on the wall please
then you think I like it when you want to paste all your frames

the one that you can slot in right
so that that drawer
you can actually see
a'ah
it's like glass
mm mm
something like that
ya
mmhmm
why would I want to walk again
it's not
ya it's not
mm it's not the as squeezy as that it's not as squeezy as this

this
ah
mm
can don't worry
it's not that squeezy
about this size about this wall
mm

no beside that
ah
correct
beside that mm
so
okay
like if you want to sit down
okay
it's up to you
okay can
this is because this is our stuff
then you can when you open you can see from inside you can see
mmhmm
definitely
mmhmm mmhmm
mm
then ah okay so beside that you have this one
and then my side
side of the bed lah
mm
side pillar
okay
table
just a wall lah
because that is when where you want to
your projector you want to
mmhmm mmhmm
understood
can show
okay
what is it with you and frames
why
no it doesn't
no it doesn't
no it doesn't cheer up the room
it looks like
mmhmm mmhmm
I understand I understand
all the sentimental values and all that I understand it's just that
why frame it
why
why would you look at it
if you put it in album why would you look at it once in a few years
even if you put
you won't look at it everyday what
it's there but you won't look at it everyday
then then like that
no need to have frame lah
feature wall
we are teenagers
so you want to look like old people
mm
I'm not that old
what is that face
and
and
ya I do
and
mm
okay
whatever
okay
take lah take lah take lah take lah
eh then you have your
whole wall then I have
wow
mm
mmhmm
okay
of course
ah I need to check again because the last one I check is ah about
two hundred one hundred to two hundred plus ah something like that
one hundred plus why not
okay then maybe two hundred plus
fine then three hundred it is
okay fine then it will
then I find the
why cannot
if I'm not wrong there's a
uh
price for it
so based on that based on that ya based on that I think is about two hundred plus
true
mm
mmhmm
then say lah you put your price like that what
you advertise five room mah
you advertise five room this this price this price and then now you you come then you want to charge more cannot what
one one five
mm
aiya cincai lah cincai lah
nothing
no I was thinking
I was thinking about
the the things that I saw on their
advertise advertisement
yes definitely
ya
mmhmm
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
correct
built-in
okay
then we need to find housekeeping
because down there they put cleaning and sanitisation you know
no no inside the inside the in Carousell the one that I see it's cleaning and sanitisation
mm
wow you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself lah
they will have a special
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
that chemical

so ya
wow
oh interesting
um
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there lah almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
mm
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
mm
mm
mm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mm
um
ah mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
mm
mm
vegan
is is there a certain
mm
mm
I
don't have anything
because of all the free time
um
but actually um
in southeast asia
mm
mm

born born to be slaughtered lah basically
mm
mm
and then
oh okay
start drawing again
err two thousand twenty one resolution
err come back to
I
but
by by time
mm
um

work from home
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
mm
um
greek
I I
one or two language first lah before ventured out
mmhmm
oh my god ya
mm
mm
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
mm mm
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
a total shit show lah
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
mm
mm
mm what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya lah cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
mm
oh but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait lah
um
what else ah
if you go
the the
ah two thousand twenty one
a burst of
creative contents
this this cannot
um go on for too long I have I have to do something to
mm
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
mm
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
mm mm
natural selections
mm mm
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
mm
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
mm
duolingo
mm
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
mmhmm
mm
mm
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
a'ah
mm
mm
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
mm
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
ah
mm
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
mm
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature lah
mm
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
mm
mm
mm
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
mm mm
I don't have any other interest
and the new age plato
mm
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called ah the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
mm
the difference
I want to go to greece again
mm
oh in addition to that scandinavian countries
oh ya ya
sweden
oh yes denmark
K lah hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
mm
mm
in ruins
mm
ah you you cannot see with your own eyes
mm
running eh
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours wow
wah long silence very long silence
uh huh death to two thousand twenty
but I think it's a good mockumentary lah to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one eh two thousand twenty
mm
and
mm
okay lah if if you could
be your younger self
mm
you know what do you have against schools ah
uh huh
mm
mm
but for you most of that internet lah kan
I think that will help a lot
ah
mmhmm
this one is the beginning okay
mm very anti climactic
okay lah I like new beginnings um
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
oh
mm
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
um
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
mmhmm
ah
mm
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
mm
mm
that's my vaccine wah
mm
mm
ah ah I wish I wish we can talk about something new lah mm
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K lah thank you
okay

the exams are like cut off about
exam are replaced with err graded assignments
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday ah ah
you design tau like
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
ah
hmm
um
but you know what uh I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
zoom or ah microsoft teams
oh she is uh in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
ah work from school even internship eh ah ya from home I mean
ah so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
and like even but then right
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work what
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that what
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then um
actually diff races okay lah
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma ah outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
oh my god
oh you mean secondary school or what
oh primary five then I still in the kindergarten lah
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay ah
but at that point of time I was
I
messenger
true lah
eighteen oh ya
hmm
why is this class not like taking it seriously
not something to be like
like absent for like out of five days leh
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
uh ya so even the teachers know that ah anytime like they had to
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious lah
like to be honest for me right
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like err for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then um
for that grade I got a
then um
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in uh
poly diploma in uh arabic private school so
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
oh oh ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard ah vanguard
oh
oh
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
ah because for my primary school like
like they like
ah separate into our six six
I don't label myself as antisocial
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group ah
oh she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
oh oh okay okay
oh no
oh
then issac was six
oh primary six oh oh but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
oh that clip okay
so you had to like
oh
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys ah
I mean like canteen
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
they got
it was a punishment
oh ya
like quite
oh ya
I think because right oh my god
oh the exam is in school
oh my god
at someone else right
no I had the same experience because ah during secondary three or secondary four I help with the book sale
so we had the books arranged at the lah so it was only like the four of us
that that lah
suddenly we were like folding something
oh no we were rearranging books to like
make sure that this section is for secondary one secondary two secondary three secondary four
then suddenly we like
no one is at school except for the admin staff and even the admin staff only no it was the other side
ignore this then we just ah started to talk again lah then we heard it again
eh
oh that is actually something ah
um
oh at that time you just ignore certain things ah ya ya
serious
um
retreat ah retreat
oh okay
oh I remember
it was like the wallpaper like for photos photo booth lah
oh google google
no one no one
err
is at the end of the pasir ris park
I avoid
oh I remember there was this one time okay ah so ah during one of the secondary three secondary four
we had like stay back ah so this was during lunchtime it was on a saturday so lunchtime
toa payoh interchange to buy food so it was left with only like a few people so like around six of us
so we played the was it werewolf or
what colour does this place have the most something like that so we played we played we played so by the end of the ten minutes or something we had to guess lah who is the spy lah
suddenly like all of us like no it's not us it's not us it's not me not me so we played that was like the fifth game so after the fifth game like eh who is it who is it because then we all showed our phone ah none of us is the spy then suddenly
ya it was a mixture of guys and girls lah so so it was like five six of us so we like
how about we go out from this classroom because like even before that right
we heard something lah at in the class it was a second level
so you were like
this one turkish horror movie
ah ah
eh I thought you internship first
oh okay
march lah
february march february lah
february I think february
shaun the sheep
oo ah
the contrast
hide and seek
oh
wait wait
which terminal
what
right now serious
so uh I was sitting beside her actually my my table is like the other end lah
standing
and I asked her lah
okay lah then I ask my friend lah are you sure like is he still there then she say ya from just now like from the thirty minutes from the starting of the class then I was like no can you see him clearly then she say ah
the shadow
eh nat
I cannot see him
then she was like
ah
okay then for that next thirty minutes right I just
but then
that kind of thing happens so I was like okay okay okay I don't want to see anymore then I was like just praying that

okay you can talk in english you know
ya it's just a mix
mmhmm and then
what module was it
do you like it
companies sustainability what is that
mm
oh that's interesting well at least you're learning something that you can apply I guess
I mean what can I do with engineering
yay where did you go
no but the fact that you guys celebrate like monthsaries
when was when was the last time I celebrated my monthsary mm
last time we didn't even celebrate I mean okay ever since
after our anniversary like me and mirza
how was my day mm today
it it's just consultation I didn't know that it's
an optional class so basically I just went all the way to ngee ann for nothing
oh my goodness I'm so sorry but I hate how ngee ann is being placed
like
that is so tragic like that school is so tragic
it's so far oh my god the walking distance I mean singapore poly wasn't even that far
it's just right in front
I ate ramen
with my uni friend cheryl her name she very nice err
we ate ramen at the beauty world food centre it's so good
it was only seven dollars and it was a

you just celebrated your fifth monthsary
one hour we need to talk
ya
okay I have some interesting questions about you so is like um like some question prompts ah that they came up with
so like this question
um
what is the one thing that you wish was free
what do you wish like
what could be something that that you wish was like something that you you cannot like pay with money
why
oh my god period
uh huh
do you feel like your expenses mostly
you will take that
okay I have to agree with you on that one I feel like
um clothes is unnecessary honestly
ya but food anything that you need to survive basically food
water shelter
yes
I agree okay then another one they ask
what is the pettiest reason that you dislike
that you would dislike someone pettiest reason mine is I cannot
like action know it all
like I think that is a pet peeve for me
an instant turn off ah basically or a different mindset than me ya
but I'm open to to educate them you know what I mean
if they're open also lah it goes both ways
okay you
boundaries
people
err lays
oh yes
oh ya ya ya mm
ya ya
action lah
ya okay
no he had to sleep early today
um
ya both our two boyfriends are in army right now enlisting
okay what
okay um
I feel like okay personally there won't be any of this
like buildings technology gadgets all of this nothing
it's true right we won't have anything if you think about it we're all that people are just working to just build all of this
so what will we do
what humans will do
I think we'll just rot eh
okay
ya there's no system lah for them to
ya
they just don't understand the value
it actually ya disciplines us lah in a way
mm
ah I think that's yes
hey
hey
the other flavour
you lying I thought there is akmal
oh girl
so there's a lot of malay guys
ya that's the thing about guys you know like they
because I'm in engineering course for the past few years then I noticed like guys
they rather be hanging out with like you know their own species like guys ya ya
like
I mean honestly okay if you are
if
like if okay if it's if it's female dominated would you like um include the guy in your group yes right
we have a lot of
but it's okay I have other friends too

okay I would get like
a good body for certain reasons
if you
were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
oh period
why you copy me
I won't get it I will just stick to mala
so everyday you're eating like different
ingredients but still the same base
I like I like I want to try mexican food though
like authentic ones
my friends in school like now school
like I've been talking to
like some of them like
having daily conversations with them on Whatsapp
he's twenty four this year so basically like he went to the he like he went he went to the route lah
so his life is basically like just moving around you know like
he lived in um abu dhabi then he came back in singapore he lived like multiple
houses in like through singapore like from the west to the east to the north
ya
then now
you know his his life is just so interesting because he
he does a lot of things and he was from then he keep he keeps telling us about like his stories
ya I told you before like he's the he's pretty short for a guy then after that like
tease him
ya and no the thing is that he was telling us the whole story then like you know guys being guys
like
but for him I feel like
he's more of a emotional kind of like softy ah I would say
ya he's a nice guy
then um I
mm
that one zul then I have like this study group
um there's
there's a total of six of us four four guys then two girls
like me and the cheryl girl lah then the the guys
one is one is a mix of japanese indian
but he knows how you talk in malay like
damn good damn fluent
then I ask him at first like eh you sure you not malay ah cause he looks like malay also
like from from my first impression then he say no
I I chinese indian japanese I
like
he's so ya but
sad lah because the the parents divorce so like he didn't really get to
mingle
what
green
what happened to it
thank you I want Nalgene please
ya because that that bottle
that bottle is basically a Nalgene
no I don't care it's only ten dollars
aww
so who's water bottle are you going to borrow now
exactly that was your water bottle
what happened to the pink Nalgene ah it's missing also
ya the hot pink was mine
mm
oh then one of my guy friends like
he very funny ah but like suddenly he
he said guys I'm tired of this
err life he he was talking to us like face to face ah like guys like
every single time we meet him he would always say wah I cannot I really want to drop out but then in the end he really dropped out
like one day before our maths test
and he's so funny
that's not even pulling through it's not even one semester
oh my god like
ya ya ya ya
he said like wah I really cannot take it
like it's always at the back of my mind he said like dropping out
and like some more he but okay lah he's job hunting
but the fact that he wants to work as a swabber
at his own like part time place it's just funny but
no like it's something for him to start up with lah
but
let it go just like that
so wasted lah
ya I mean that's my motivation that's my only motivation
as of now
I should have studied culinary arts
according to my friend he said that his friend
is studying culinary arts right now
in so what they do is that every single day
they have to cook and they have like
like their modules um module grades are based on how they perform lah
in the kitchen like their conduct
all of that
whose that
waalaikumusalam
sasun you want
he was out with his friends
cycling
from where
but you get tired from socialising from your boyfriend
being socially present and active
does it mean that it's hard for you to
to build a conversation with them or you rather like you just rather not
there's nothing wrong with that what
oh it's not a stereotype ah it's actually a real thing
I think engineering school is pretty mute
discussions for every tutorial oh my god you know
oh my god
my tutorials are just paper
on paper it's just assignments ah basically
I'm so fed up with my programming group
that guy was really
like putting up a fit man
like his attitude was just oh my god
like because err one of my group member
like he action do
but in reality he doesn't know lah but he's the type of
person who believes that
whatever effort you put in is you all going to be worried I don't care about the grades
then I'm like here thinking no I need the grades because that's the only point I mean that's the only
reason
like why I want to hire someone else lah to do the code then he say no he doesn't want
then in the end we cannot like proceed with the hiring ah like outsourcing because it needs the
like mutual agreement what
in the group
so it's just
me and cheryl against him and another guy
oh my god
ya so he said it's okay if we get C
man like at this point
ya
and now he's doing uh the code all by himself
I don't even know what's going on you know programming computer programming ya
that's part of engineering
to what colour
no at this point my hair is dying
no I just don't want to
like you know now is already dry
don't you feel like when you're when you're
when your hair is coloured like it's very fragile
dye your hair no you liar
so there was something lah
do you regret
if I were to dye my hair
I'd dye
I want green man
there's just something about green
depends on what shades though
oh that bright one ah I prefer the
very is dark
but it's on a lighter shade
hmm
poor man
ya very often
I mean we don't really like celebrate it celebrate it
it's not that special of an occasion
what's that
mother dough
what do they sell croissants
is it like is it better than that tiong bahru bakery
how much
for one
pastry

coffee and how much was it
oh my god
that you sent me
mm ya
but not the recent ones
I saw it I sent to you I sent to you and it's I sent it to you I sent that video to you
no but the fact that they they keep those
tigers
well at least they're feeding them you know what I mean
but do you like to go to the zoo
my my boyfriend hates it hates it he he doesn't like it
ya
he's a man of his words
which is nice lah
oh my god
what he say
oh you're talking about
mmhmm
mmhmm
from their homes
old folks home
oh that's cute
but so err um
that's what I feel
but like all of them chinese is it
or is it a mix
you could have asked your chinese friends
okay what what what do you want the outcome to be just them doing TikTok and enjoy
but are foods provided
oh I get it I
think christmas eh
think it's pretty hard eh considering there's like no physical interaction
I mean it'll be it'll be more meaningful if there's physical interaction
aww
second
as his pet
that's so cute
why why why why why the sudden interest
so
what happened to the fish
so is that the only pet um pet he has
he miss his mummy lah
then what did he say
then now
hmm but he's so cute
no but he needs he needs to have a proper home so tomorrow he's going to buy
what
aww
how
and that's still small
like fun meh he doesn't get to interact you know with the pet
so he's going to bring the snail to the camp
oh
is that the only pet err he has
as compared to the fish
hamsters
ham ham
of what oh my god
you want to hear a ghost story of my um friend is
um he's doing his enlistment lah eh doing his guard duty
in tekong
so basically right
um
he's the type to not believe in all of these are like ghosts
spirits pontianaks all of that ah
until one night
like he experienced this this
he thinks ah
so basically right
he and this other um guy his friend chinese guy
they were on guard duty
so they patrol patrol they have to patrol around it
like but they behind that ammunition dump there is this
it's a forested area and it's damn dark there wasn't any light or lamp post
so dark but they still had to go there and make like some rounds lah whether there's like anyone there
err I don't believe all of this lah nonsense eh want to follow me or not like
see what's what's inside
then my friend he's an indian guy he's like what the heck don't want lah for what then after that

mmhmm

ya okay
so
um not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
portrait malay portrait of you
oi if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
um cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at uh one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really um
check and um keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
wah ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
mm
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
and if if this is like a uh continuous pattern
where if you all fight you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games lah bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please lah muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that eh she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
ah see lah all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted mah so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts ah denial
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy lah so it's fine K stop oh shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
um
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit lah bro like
ya ya you have to
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
huh okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive what
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya lah if never take care lor
ya ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon lah
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
ah sorry lah it's fucking sus lah it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no lah for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like oh that's why we ah got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting what right
like a a are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck oh my god
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one ah
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
hmm I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app lah correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's amin which guy
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
is there drama now with you and amin
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive ah listen ah okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me oh I'm talking to this fella um
and then after I say okay um
how did you meet her
and then after that oh through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
uh fate eh that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
platonically as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already what then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect meh to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and ah if you want to talk about F uh ah friends friends I got a lot of friends lan jiao lah must be one of them must be your date meh
like you don't have any workmates meh you don't you're not motivated in life
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no lah it's bullshit lah if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it meh
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit eh if let's say you went out with this fella and with
syafiq the one that you never date what amin syafiq okay so amin is the one you date before
so if you went out with amin and syafiq okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you ah eh just break up ah
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit eh like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
eh I got talk to her before I got date her before oh now she talking to that guy ah
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
mm ah you mm ah mm mm
because you are you trying to say that oh he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya lah me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this syafiq eh no akim guy akim akim you need to just
play your game well just say lor like
flirt to text not to sext
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so ah shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be eh he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten what right
so you need to understand I know I have three I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K chao
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go what
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating mah officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using ah but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say ah people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart lah for me for me is like
at least have the sense of um intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that uh you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
eh eh uh no if I were you
for me to find out more red flags
so
wah
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one ah like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine eh if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird what it's fucking weird bro
I'm not trying to uh anyhow to do ah but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
oh so his relationship was like three years ah
with the first girl
kiwek okay lah
then he got single then he dated that girl
uh huh
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no lah with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
oh so she state it when
okay okay then
correct um so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
um
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up ah bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this uh this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch mah
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
then um
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
um uh asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch what you should know the criteria what as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain what because if you don't get the girl then shut up lah so
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded tau you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than uh if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
um uh how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like oh fuck I'm a malay I cannot eh shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then like you big fuck
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird lah unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame what like
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
did you know what I'm saying
ah so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording ah
they need to type ah their to
ah transcript huh portrait copy paste copy paste
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
chao if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
in jail eh say once I get past my O levels I will marry uh and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is what I used to what that's a fucking pattern what you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards ah but you deserve so much more
to be in this position with a guy that send you a portrait
oh whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot lah because not twenty twenty vision mah put braces mah my eyes
they lie people lie
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
oh maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking um pursue a better goal
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn uh like maybe because
how to say ah when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say ah for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
uh dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like oh you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
um like I have a lot to work on but
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
cause he's fucking fat wah fuck you chibai want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up ah want to look at my boyfriend for what
buto I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
oh anytime if I want to cut you off which is good lah I think you have low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping ah
mm mm
correct so
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck ah
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work meh
ya isn't that good
huh
but then
ah that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick lah huh looks and also um
not status looks and um body language
when that is okay then after that your your
uh no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
mm test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this uh and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner uh uh toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
don't don't need to date men
when you're in the grey area don't need to
motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
but you reciprocate
uh
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt what right so when
he see that girl as an opportunity to get to know other hot chicks so
when she him and saying that oh you're so cute
he's like a before me he was a fucking flirt cause he's single but he try to play off like I'm just a friend what but I know you're fucking flirt you know
before that I was I never use people before because of him I used people because of what happened then after that um
when you get close to the girl the girl obviously like like him but then he with
and he was friendzoning her because she got other hot chicks hot friends
and then that is to me is like then okay lor then I'm not that mad at the fact that you still keep in contact but at the end of the day
once he was a bit more serious with me he cut contact with that girl because he knows that I'm not happy but I told him I'm fucking liberal
going to allow you to meet her face to face and and it just gives
what like you reciprocate like it's more nicer to hear that oh
my boyfriend is the first guy that I asked out but then you should not
put so much weight into your your decisions people make mistakes if he's not the one you shouldn't be like eh he's the first guy I asked
okay
okay okay okay okay contradicting ah okay
good lah then then
you sure okay if you feel like you in denial right really make believe
make believe that like
no make believe when when when the right time so when you want to flirt with him right think of it
okay I'm your friend what so it's not wrong for me to say this but then when when after that he say some fucked up shit right
turn back and be like eh but this is the fella that I want to might want to date okay I must like attack him back
but you know you get what I'm saying like you have to play smart
spy
speaker speaker
see ah
wait ah you go ask all of this shit because like you waste more time ah then after that when you get to know after the like what one year ah wasted sia
wasted you going to be like
what the fuck you are this lame actually I could have met other fucking guys I could have hang out with my other friends
who knows he's fucking insecure for all we know
motherfucker he dated two girls that are whack the fuck
he doesn't know shit about life
stills tell me I love you on the the second time we met tell him already I won't be with you because I'm I just came out of a relationship

there was this other person also andrew garfield you know

ya then that will be his fault
ya
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year eh
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like you assume that the other person will know
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a err a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
err
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
boyish lah so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants ah so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically lah
I think we both know that lah
ya so just tell me what you want lah so in a way communication works
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
mm mmhmm
okay mm
mmhmm mmhmm
ya ya as long ah you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
ya
Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
oh damn
oh
muffin mitten oven mitten
is it the rainy day
its the rainy season
wow
oh my god I'm so annoyed with this trump and biden thing
cause like err back then like like few
ya and then like I have to like nudge him and say like you know like
communicate ah if you please wear the stupid earpiece please
I am the president
when he's he's not president
jer
okay
ah
uh on trump um surprisingly ah quite good looking guy
ya when he was like younger
ya
ya supposed to go to the office today cause every monday is a calling day so err but its raining so he I don't know whether he's gonna call at home I mean technically he can call at home its just that when you are at the office and everyone is calling you will be motivated to call right
so I don't know why they do calls on monday I mean mondays got monday blue as a customer as a client would you want to be called on monday for insurance like don't disturb me on monday monday is really lousy
ya but monday
wait he suppose to call you
orh
mm mm
ya
mmhmm
mm
ya
ya ya ya
oh okay
is it because it covers slightly more I don't know
oh
mm
mm
mm mm
orh okay
okay
but if you terminate
orh okay okay
oh
this is under adam or your own
I know that is doing very well right now so that's why he's trying to get like um all his clients to invest in sector because Apple is coming up lots of stuff um a lot of people will invest in that and
ah mmhmm
mmhmm
side
oh oh
oh
UNICEF ah
ah ah that's the one
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
think you should work on your timings
short form
funny though
sorry but um yes err in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus oh not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically err I'm not sure which year
so
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them eh so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop project work
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
that's it ah
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work lah
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
mm mm
mmhmm
mm mm
ah
its its definitely different lah cause um
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but um for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you lah
but
for me is is still okay cause
ya
uh huh
a'ah
ah
ya then they will be screwed up ah which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year
um I'm coming later
okay the thing is like when we wake up as a form teachers you have to take attendance so they will have to be in this like zoom call or whatever and then like
err there will always be this one or two people who never wakes up
it's like
ya and its like
ugh its still retained there in my mind so annoying
ya and
um in a way yes because like I don't have to like teach and I can chill a bit but the fact that I still have to go to work and I cannot travel cause it's the only time that you can travel right end of year to travel to like europe country um
that's it ah december holidays
I don't think you got book no book
to to to do you have the link
um mac birthday is next month she's been wanting to go singapore flyer mac
no no no I mean you can use some of it so I check already so senior citizen is like thirty something
adult is fifty
there goes my fifty
can ah
right you should be able to stack though
ten ten dollar vouchers that accumulate to hundred ya
but fifty dollars for a ferris wheel
ya she's been wanting to
oh well
um

my day um
then the queue outside to enter is so long cause right now is COVID right like you know
so the maximum number of people to be inside the store is like only twenty five
and it's black friday so
people like trying to get in so even if I tell them uh I'm sorry lah you cannot
then they just keep doing the annoyed face
but the I'm just saying ah not not not really good not a good day how about you
like I see everybody is like shopping black friday's sale so good
hmm good question
then you where where was where was your intern again
oh that's your interview I mean like when your intern start
oh cause I got part time school and
holidays is not holidays already
revise and get all the projects done
but this time is infographic but
it's better it's a group project so at least
me
mm I think I'm just like cause right now I
then but for you you I thought you studied like
mm cause right now it's not
easy to get accounting job with uh like
maybe I try to apply if I get if not what I'm just going to go maybe just administrative work
but
overseas
oh my god if COVID is over
just like
of course like I miss most is like the different
like currency you know like anything it's just anything and everything is cheaper there
like it's in singapore you know the everything is much more expensive so you can't spent that much
you have to be like save save a bit
um I don't really
have a favourite like
but I know you're more into fashion kan
so actually how about you just tell me like actually what kind of like
fashion you're into right now
like koreans are known for their skin
you know like their clear skin
and it's like actually cheaper to buy there is cause they they sell it like in bundles and like there's always promotion on their items
but I but like they are also known for their fashion but I didn't like I'm not into it so I didn't buy a lot of like their shoes or like clothing
so it was like wasted lah I I didn't also visit all their
attractions much
I'm sure you also have a dream
country to go right like what is it
wah
you like anime
wah what anime you watch already
favourite anime
mm like currently I like I find haikyu really cute like I've I've like keep up with like from season one to season four like
but thanks lah actually this kind soul actually introduced me to anime I just started I don't I don't like really
know about anime but after watching it like I've grown interest into it
mm I think it's more on like
like you know school
that kind of anime ya
I don't like the one like you know
there's one I don't know there's one kind of anime I don't I'm not really into it but
okay lah but I like anime like it's like in cartoon
cartoon but more on
in things that actually happening in real life like that's the thing like make me fall in love with anime
mm like I said I like haikyu so I'm actually into like kenma
like he's like really chill guy
ya like he was like a simple guy but he just like inside he's always like bursting so at certain time when he
instead of being quiet he he just like get angry that's when like he but he looks cute like I find it cute
ya
it's okay lah anime is like a way to like it's a getaway from like real life
hmm before anime actually I used to watch K drama like you know K drama
oh eh you heard already you never watch it before
like
mm I think I watch mm like
most of running man episode
like you know running man like be when kang gary was inside
like I don't like they are different already lah like is not the
the running man that it used to be but okay lah I still watch I still keep up with them
but you eh
hello
what year is that kang ho dong inside two days one night like now
uh K pop oh ya K pop is what makes me when into K drama and all K pop
the first thing was actually feel in love with jeong eun ji
just made me fell in love with her
favourite song from who
orh if A pink like no I listen to most of their songs like I just keep up with all their songs
there's no like favourites lah actually because all their song is nice very catchy
oh no no lah I just found it inside my wardrobe
like what is even the difference between soccer and football
huh food mm I'm not so sure lah a thing about me is I don't have like favourite favourite thing like
I like I like I don't like I don't like
like I don't know I don't believe in favourite
why you have is it
me
mm
I like I say lah like I
eat what add stuff is it
oh it's not like I don't eat
the go-to is sure McDonald's lah
oh ya talking about samurai burger right now they they they bring back samurai burger wah I was so excited during COVID cause usually they
bring out in like mid
of the year
like because of COVID they have like McDonald was close
so now that they open it they bring back samurai I was so happy like I think I ate it twice already this week
but if like their menu
I usually go for the angus burger
it's like a upgraded version of cheeseburger like you how about you what what is your go-to menu at McDonald's
at the end of the day I'll still go for like home-cooked meals
Jollibee oh my god Jollibee is a Jollibee is a filipino
fast food right
Adam's Corner
Adam's Corner
oh you suggest me to eat at Adam's Corner there
wah
then what what do you suggest me eating there
water chestnut
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there lah cause more of nature so many insects
I um my sister she used to lah she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong lah
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
if you not a if you just like um afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school haiyo
huh
wow I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try lah try to be on time lah it's school it's important
me graduate
I started school err this year april
so it's only been how many months
uh few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
hmm looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so lah
then eh you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
oh
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
mm I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your during secondary school
wow then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
uh that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
uh no I take care of myself very well
um like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay lah since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
oh really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
oh good lah
hmm nevermind lah
like
right now oh you heard about like
uh I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
oh
it's okay lah we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
uh I really
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good lah you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
wah I really I like oh yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know uh
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
ah every month but now
like I heard like like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
oh wah everything you want to do with your friend ah then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
oh uh you heard talking about like and all you heard about like
uh government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure lah but like what it can be use for
only like certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
relax what you so stress about
wah talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like uh allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
swim oh uh have you like you know uh sentosa also there's a lot of like
uh activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually
uh oh I used to work at luge actually I've I find luge
it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
uh trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because uh apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same lah
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
uh I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you lah
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try lah I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
wow that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands huh
wah then what's your favourite car
but I'm just not into it like you know like
like there's interest in car no I like car I mean it
I can sit down it gets me to places with shelter
oh then you watch tokyo drift ah you like japanese car
oh the fast and furious movies is it ya actually tokyo drift all uh
is it is it too fast too furious or the fast and furious one oh I think just anything before that is nice but after
I don't like not really into the show lah
way before what don't so text me just saying you watch the show when there's paul walker
so when there's no paul walker you don't watch it anymore
nissan skyline
oh I think I heard of that car before
wah but I don't know lah I I'm I look so weird by myself like I don't have like interest
but it's weird you don't know like people always have like will be interest in cars interest in bikes
or interest in like footballs and all
ya I'm amazed that like
wah so you have been supporting that club since you were three years old
wow
I feel like that's against your will
but it's okay I guess you learn
you grow to learn the eh eh you learn to grow
hais
english is hard but it's okay I think you love your club already but is your club really good actually or you just love them
but is man U still as good as they were

I don't really hear much about them anymore so like
I don't know anything but it's
cool to know lah from you
true lah you also cannot expect all good players to go into man U right of course you have to give chance to other teams to bring up their name also
are you being an haters right now like maybe right now it's liverpool time to shine
hmm interesting wow
wah I feel like wah I'm not looking forward for work tomorrow like
uh ah I also just want to relax and really just watch something I like
true
hais
nevermind I think we just have to endure a bit
get through this hard time then maybe when we're
things are easier
then we can just
enjoy life already
ya I agree
is it
rain before sunshine
but just a bit more let's let this COVID pass and then we can get back our good jobs
mm mm
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
uh like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay lah let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education

eh true true
stop me from
pursuing it cause I think they also like know
I feel like
actually
you should not

you think you cannot fly
yes in order to succeed we have to fail first because we won't know
our mistake
in
mm
so my father say if he have to pay right then he gonna be bankrupt like he's just gonna be bankrupt
I think must pay a sum of ten K if I'm not wrong or like more than ten K

it's like
we don't
we don't
push each other than the one person who was pushing the other person just left behind or whatever shit I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to say but ya
K it's like for example
I cannot be there at the same level I cannot be at the same pace as you
I have I'll be lagging behind cause I'm pushing you
I cannot be
I cannot be standing beside you and push you
you reach the finishing you reach the finish line first I'll be at behind then who will be helping me you cannot pull my hand cause you at the finishing line already

um
err what depression level are you right at right now I think you are at stage three
um
stage three
you are still at the denial stage you don't want to accept it yet
unlike me I'm at stage five
eh
at stage three
um you
you K one the signs of you um being at stage three is because you still can't accept
the fact that he's far way behind eh far way in front of you already
ya
and then
ah then
wah you funny you again sis alamak sis
correct
he stage three depression but now he already you think he stage five now or he's still at stage three
or maybe at stage four
still at stage three ah

but actually I actually you don't need to pause I only need to pause
why so dark sis your
room
ah no electricity
oh
oh yes sis my house at night really oh sis we left thirty second
a'ah sis
then we can continue the second part

eh hazim so what have you been doing in school today
orh
oh I see I see
then then like how's the progress for that one going
oh I see I see
huh serious ah what the is like
oh for three questions
orh ya sia
so that part we have to like
just write a
write uh regarding
what's this
err exercise benefits on
err for people who have err chronic diseases demo
uh no uh that's the infographic ah but then for the assignment part is
we just have to write about
like err
what issues they face
um when adhering to this err
this err err exercise programme ya
so it's like from err is like a assignment lah
ya
so ya lor that's been like
err what's been taking up the most the most of my time for the past two weeks
no ah I no time lah
like really like really just been about school mah the past the past like
don't know how many weeks
err considered moonlighting lah so they they don't want me to
work lah ya
just focus on school ah
then you eh you still at
orh
oh ya ya
then what he angry ah
a'ah
oh
oh ya ya
oh that's week three ah
orh
oh ya we have
the drive
clinical decision making
so that's like an assessment but that one quite fast like I also don't get why is it so fast ah they have so many groups to assess
oh but that one damn shag ah that one that one cause the previous assessment
me and darren never really do that well
so this one really have to buck up lah
then for
following the following week is
what ah week
week thirteen so that one is all the
is all the is all the one prac and one
and one paper
so that one also quite shag
uh ireland
no dude it's freaking
seven hours before us so now is three O three thirty so now there is
bro damn early sia
then like she say
a lot of us like tell her uh prof have a good rest
then she was like uh no uh I have class after this
then like bruh
ah ya no she
I mean
that also and like
and like wah she damn shag sia
like really ah but mad respect lah I think she's one of the better profs like
that this ya that ireland has to offer
like at least she like
explained her stuff compared to like all the other profs who like just give
and like you don't even know what they expect then this one she will specifically state like oh this thing that thing
ya
so which is good lah so we know what to expect
but sometimes she can be long-winded lah and repeat her stuff then that one like a bit sidetrack
err like midnight ah ya uh our midnight so it's like their five
around there ya
I mean it's not like their students staying up lah is
us
who are in a totally different time zone have to end up so they have to accommodate to us
wah shit then this weekend also like
then last weekend there was not football sia then
damn sian
ya
damn sian lah like okay but some of the scores were quite mad leh like the portugal one
ya sia
ah ya
wah sia you all
ya sia then just put jota up front what the heck
but man U also I don't know ah a bit on and off
like I watch also like doesn't feel like I want to be a man U supporter anymore
legit sia like that day I was I was watching the everton manchester game right
then like I thinking wah this one everton confirm win
and then everton lose then I what the heck
oh ya ya ya he tackle
oh he tackle maguire
but that one they he never they never give anything that one they let off I think
but wah that one hais I don't know lah
ya sia lucky this weekend got football if not
boring sia
your what who who
liverpool game I think
oh liver eh
really I I rather watch in the in the evening sia
ya lah I rather watch in the evening I I actually
I actually wake up to watch champions league games eh nowadays
that's how bored I am
oh dude it's tottenham and man city
this weekend still got err internationals
oh tottenham man city will be sick oh liverpool leicester also
wah shit
how to set up my team like that sia
eh got play or not
why you never play sia
will be fun I mean just need to set up the team then sua just leave it already
serious
but shah they all don't play meh terry they all
oh oh oh
you you stopped playing takraw also
hmm
dude there's a lot of kids at my neighbourhood just
gather ya not not just that like they play like there's group of seven or eight people then they just play badminton
play
takraw lah then like nobody care leh
I read like many it's it's like they don't give a shit lah
but then now now I feel like
singapore also quite stable lah so
you think will move into phase three or not
they say most likely before end of the year
so like
huh eighty per cent
of of what
oh then they will go into phase three
oh that's the incentive ah
sian
I mean just for that bit of freedom lah but then still need wear mask ah
ya they say is like
it's like won't be as what you experience
before like it won't be back to pre-COVID life lah definitely
but I just hope like there comes a point in time whereby don't need wear mask
damn hard to breathe sia sometimes
especially on hot days
hmm
but then
what to do is like that lor
oh you want to go
ah ya lah then I think need wear mask also right
I think so definitely lah that is also true
oh but then got a lot of the
actually I also kinda miss ah
but they selling all the they selling all the equipment online
like ya
but that is quite expensive sia
but then again is all used lah so I think the price is even cheaper but then other people use already sia you want to use meh
ya sia that's why
but I also
huh
but I also want to go back sia
wah that will be that will be the dream sia
huh
wait why are you in police uniform
oh the ah
oh ya ah
deepavali eh isn't deepavali on the fourteenth
ah oh that is true
oh ya ya
so you deployed to
to little india ah orh
eh you get you are that division
I always thought you at the woodlands one
ah
oh okay I mean that's more convenient lah in my opinion ya easier mah
wah then that yesterday I also talked with adrian
about like you know adrian is in
oh err TransCom adrian lah
he also went for shooting the other day
ya then he says he's damn busy now
ya supposed to be this week
but then they I told them
so they say okay never mind can come another time then like oh okay ah then they I think they reschedule me for
january ah january eight ya
next try will be next try will be when ah early of eh
eleventh of jan I think
ah oh damn
okay lah hopefully lah cause
the the one that they actually ask me to go now right is like
ya but I don't know why they ask me okay err thursday you come for then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
oh
maybe ah
orh
I mean that would make sense lah is earlier
ah
been awhile since I go there also sia
eh no lah last time I went was for
wah that one shaggy
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it err you so um one week
push-up all that right the person is
err standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count lor
but then err cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
err
there's no gauge for you when to
uh push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier lah but then
ya sia true
you got try at maju ah
ah maju the
maju is very the the machine
the the what ah the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run eh the
the
uh statics because is all automatic
err when I use then I wah
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like wah I never run this fast before sia
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been sia
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like wow
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it lah but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider maju lah
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
ah
ah ya ya same same like maju lah
I mean
okay lor
sick wait with incentives is hundred right
then silver is three hundred then the max is
the max is five hundred lah the gold
wah but I never hit gold before
only that time sia when we were in
everyday right
ya
ah
uh huzaini eh that day I saw ben though
ya the the one who
screw us up
ya
he
block eleven
ah ya ya ya
I think so
I think
I think he's when he he got like C or something wah cui sia cause of that incident
but then
now he I think doing quite well ah
okay lah I think he took his job too seriously
but as a person outside I think he okay cause
uh he like
somewhat remembered me lah
then I just talk to him then
like I think he's studying at University of Buffalo
forget for what already
but I don't know why he was at though
it was like during the sports appreciation night

oops my bad oh marine parade east coast plan
ya he knows more about the squad than than figadi

huh he got ah
then again I always see his story every time got different girl lah
but I feel I feel like ya like
safi was more for us
was there more
compared to gary ah gary was like
ah ya ya
no lah
qawi
we got we kena him once or twice ya ya ya
when gary was missing then like needed like a replacement so
it was him
it was him then sometimes got qawi also cause I think
uh who's this safi was close to qawi
ya
no what I thought like we got him like
middle of the way
and then
is it okay really sia I thought he was there for quite substantial period
oh ya the ending
oh ya ya
then the ending was like very little stuff to do already I remember we just ya if really nothing do we just sit at the door
and then
eh you all want play football or not
in the end did we even play
I don't recall playing sia at the shack
I just remember the
the sports day you you got play you played frisbee right
oh you were right
oh halfway through you meet angus

ya sia I always felt isa should have gotten it sia
I I don't think he wanted it though
ya
hmm
in the end where he go ah
no no no uh isa
oh right ya ya ya
I always thinking I always thought it was command like not commanders like
but then that's nas karim
aqil umar ya
ya I think the four of them only but the four of them also I think were instructors
oh
oo
instructor ah
I always thought like what what would you be like if like
my experience was front line
cause I mean
I'm behind behind the scene a bit boring lah as in
okay lah lesser stress but then
no action also sian
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff
you
no lah siao why talk about
there was one lah but it's damn lame it's not like it's not like your kind of standard like go go deployed for anything is like
is this is the police day parade is it
uh I think then it was at
marina stadium there ah then what they did was what I had to do was err
I just accompany them on the boat
and then just
do towards lor
wait I don't know what's this I forget already but then
I think home team show then they then all the people they just come onto
the boat
then they the my all the regulars
show them around make them
ya that was okay lah but then
I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do
okay lah
fudge
plaster
that was like legit like ninety percent of the time sia plaster
ya
eh then later what movie you all watching
orh that's the free ticket one you all got ah
eh I thought you had one extra ticket
or is that xavier
so you you xavier maria
who's joel
oh volleyball joel ah
oh at dhoby
oh ya that's true ah okay
what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about sia
is it like is it like like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like wow this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any manga before sia
got recommends
oh the comics but why you read sia
no as in as in what what what what what was it
now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good sia
but that's
black panther eh
ah ya black widow I think
end of the year ah
the
the whole marvel scene
who fuck sia
wait why did this even happen like
how did this even happen
orh
no
orh
but now what he doing sia
is it
oh ya
after
I see serious
orh
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions lah
that's what he don't have
ya sia that one wah that one shiok eh
but
coney island ah
is literally coney island group
okay lah then we got one more year you want you want
eh no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
huh no ah
I mean
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
oh ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and hasif got the gazelles team
the hasif
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool eh and
but sad lah like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked imran lah like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun lah
I miss playing football sia
why sia
orh
is the clutch game ah
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers lah then
then I think hasif just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya lah quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
and it's just play amongst themselves and me lah so is like
unfair to others lah so I think they decided to leave
but that one safi jio
so then they stayed for long they were good lah but then ya just selfish lor
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play sia
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then uh I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
err think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then wah I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged lor
but by then they all would have played at right
wah shiok sia wah shiok
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time lah before before like
before
year two okay lah year two was fun lah
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky lah they get to travel that one
ya not bad ah
ya ya
bo pian lah so it's just like
you just go there then you learn about their healthcare system
get to know like they are how their
how the hospital works actually they all I was surprised sia like their
they quite
not say backwards lah but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old lah
ya maybe ya cause that one was up a mountain leh
but it was quite cool lah then
try soba then the
err we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go dublin right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good lah so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan ah
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya ah
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure oh ya that is true
ya sia ya sia
how you got learn ah
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya
macarons
isn't that like super sweet or something
the capsule ah
orh
wah sounds tough sia
I do err during the circuit breaker at what they are
I mainly bake cake also pandan cake
err what other cake
err was it
butter
honey pound ah ya but then like
and all my like asked me like eh why you suddenly like start baking then like I got bored ah
but all the baking was just like just to relieve stress lor cause I think that period was also like exam period
ya then
ya lor that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell lah
it was just like at home doing nothing
actually it was quite therapeutic lah having that like time to myself also
oh ya that's true lah that's why a lot of people like
they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype leh
you me no you did
oh ya ya chloe kept on trying lah I think dekai also kept on trying
oh ya lah
neighbours
actually mac and cheese I don't know why sia
because there was that time when err
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself lah for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up sia then I eat right I can still the taste the flour eh
ya maybe ah probably probably
wah but that one whole week was quite
shiok ah having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right wah is actually
ya
but the
ah ya you use what
mmhmm
mean
I think I use parmesan parmesan cheese
I think it was not bad
but I also use it to make this pasta recently
I think I made with fifi
then like he teach me how to like
make make what's this thing called
make err the mushroom more meaty ah
so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill ah
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like err
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
err take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside mah
then after that he will
he will take
oh what he do after that ah oh ya then he will take
err like this
press it then
err so you will take out all the moisture wah then we make
we use that to make like cream pasta wah damn nice sia
actually next time right if like after all this
like if can go each other house then
you all can come then we can try to make it together
ya
I feel like cooking also
ya ya ya it's just like how you
oh right right right
ya cause nowadays also sometimes my mum will fast
so like I think
which days ah which days normally fast ah mondays ah I think
then like she will tell me okay help me taste because I fasting
then like okay
ya then I agree with you lah like
cooking really on feel one like
no matter like even the recipe said state like like this like this like this right but end of the day right I think feel
or like the passion
for cooking is more important
oh ya that is true
the you know the the ya ya ya that one
my dad also ah so
that's been that's been what what they
been doing ever since retirement ah of if the
the show I don't know if you know no no no

it's quite cool
oh oh they never ah okay

oh ya ya ya

just need to cope well I guess and manage time since you're working als
test um
so I guess you
your design course is more into like you know assignments and project I gues
mm
but even during like they call it circuit breaker or something but I eh even had to come back during the circuit breaker cause like the err the experiment I was doing was really like ongoing ah and it has to be complete
mm I need to do something in life you know lik
further my studies not and and not just like you know work and there's more things for me to lear
ho
mm
because I can still work and earn money to support for myself so that I can pay my school fees while completing my studies mm but I guess I'll be like you ah uh working while studying is gonna be very tiring and I'm kind of concerne
how am I going to manage my time but it's okay I need that degre
um
oh ya COVID we didn't have a chance to go outside becaus
I mean like for this current situation right now you can still go out with friends ah but to like limited places and with limited amount of people I think the max is like five people or somethin

mm choose from I gues
mm
bu
if you really want to go staycation err you need to tell me earlier so I can like plan my schedule and take leave
mm
all I can say was that I remember the bed being comfy and I mean even there if there's like no pool right we can just chill and watch netflix and you know have food take away then we can eat at the hote
they actually having promotion where like I think you have one day staycation from like ten to eigh
and you are paid seventy five dollars per adult and the good thing about that promotion is that you can have access to all the facilities ah mean you can go like if you like water activities we can go do some kind of lik
don't know the pedal thingy I don't know what you call that or we can just hang out by the poo
kno
mm err I mean like if really cannot find a like we really cannot go to shangri la there's other affordable hotels I guess if I'm not wrong you can use th
website agoda or something where you can find like a day hotel for you to hang out with my friend usually use that lah for like to surprise them for like birthday or something they always do that and mm
what else eh
waitress waiter if I'm not wron
take you out for dinner or something you can jus
you know walk around singapore see the sight view or something but nowadays rain lah so I scared sia
how to say go out later rain no umbrella stuck in rain borin
mm if I'm not wrong my date went there before and he said that is not bad lah maybe lah we should we should go there but you have to find a time when it's not crowded and a lot of people mm if you really want to go cafe and like you know do some kind of activities righ
I also heard about this cafe called the mind cafe but this one also like a lot of people has been going there and it's crowded so you really have to find a time where there's not a lot of peopl
oka
of cours
uh huh
you know me I'm still awkward with her right cause like I never meet her for so long I also don't know what is she doing with life also like the last time I met her was whe
I accompanied her to her job to sign up for a job at this hotel I am not really sure but it's near suntec city or something like that then that was the last time I really like go out with her other than that I didn't talk to her I didn't text her or whatsoever it jus
err
mm but in pol
mm I don't really ya lah I I never reall
post if I have any like relationship or whatsoever because I feel like there's no poin
like you know posting online that I'm with this person or whatsoever as long as like me and him know that we're dating and he knows them well to tell other people that he's dating to
I don't know I just don't like sharing much I like to keep it low key to me lah the lesser people know the bette

cause it's really really bad and I also heard about your manager your manager i
is not a very nice person lah as I can se
and I guess those I really think that delifrance or any kind of retail workers are underpaid ah I guess like having like seven fifty per hour or eight fifty per hour is not that sufficient especially you're working like part time part time only lik
so ya please quit that jo
I mean the job is fine is just the culture there is ba
and I really hope this um new job will open more opportunity for you since it's like more in line to what you're doing for school right so you can build up your portfolio from ther
plus you have experience from your like internship so that will be a good point ah

a'ah sia I don't know why they don't want to increase the minimum wage I feel like it's not fair ah your like some people in certain category are earning this much and this much for like you know for their work I don't think it's sufficient for them to liv

and just now also he say got this woman not wearing masks and she claim that she's pregnant and she has a letter from the doctor saying that she don't need to wear mask wha

okay I hope sial I hope it's alright
ya it's like that lah
um
okay then
why what did she say
is it really a is it really even even a break up
ya lah because honestly he like how to say say uh he says like back then like oh we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act lah not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating lah even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels eh no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
haiya you know I don't know lah
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks lah it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group
shut up lah to shut up okay
shut up lah
just shut
okay
anyway err oh ah did you get your polling station place that you assigned to for the job
no the one that you for the job

there's so like there's different there's different
what do you call it different
I guess like dude
I said start elite
difference different how you say different models different
ah ah a bigger sample group ya a biggest sample group will make for a more effective
study ah whatever lah

oh what did you eat today
you buy the bee hoon or did you cook
your mother
I woke up today I didn't even eat
err I woke up and then I eat at seven o'clock
ya
so I only had like one meal today
ya man
I think tomorrow I'm supposed to go out tomorrow is sunday right eh no today's friday
sunday I'm supposed to supposed to go meet adela and menaz
I can't be bothered lah
no uh the part with adela I'm just like
uh you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I uh I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
wow
the ah I already told you what that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like oh I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
eh you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no ah you're not lah
that's why I don't say all girls are trash ah like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting sial
like she keep saying about
um she keep telling telling us like oh I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me err clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's um
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable lah
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no lah uh when the girl's the exception they say uh no lah she's just the exception exception like
like eh enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no lah she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
uh it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your your your ex for
behaving a certain way also what like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know
what else man
nowadays nowadays is all
it's slide sliding to the arms
what
ya you see afiq now he wishes if he he doesn't have a boyfriend uh girlfriend
ah I I I I hope that they can resolve their issues
ASAP
but ya rashal's like keep asking me to go meet and then I'm like I don't know whether I can
actually I said okay how about tomorrow then I was like I don't know because by right I have the meeting what the filming for
so
they they also never update us about the situation but I think as of now like got nothing there's no venue
you're not allowed to
huh
no way I
wait they didn't tell me anything
wait if that
that means they won't have the
the materials
ah I check after
after this lah
I don't want to make extra tippy tapper tippy tap noise ya tippy tap noises
that's why so maybe she wants to talk about it I don't know
a'ah maybe
no lah no lah I don't think so also lah but I don't think I don't think so lah like I didn't think you I didn't even think she wanted to talk about it until you you mentioned about the filming
who's asking to meet you also
oh what was I going to say ah oh ya she wanted to invite syakif also syakif and irfan to come
dude ugh uh ah ya azuleen azuleen over
what's your
what's your ya it's it's so it's so dead nobody knows I don't know
what
you're not what you're not you're just jealous of us
you wish you had you wish your group was this hype
no you you just think because you see from the outside you like eww but then I bet I bet if you were like inside the group if you confirm like oh ya azuleen is the best I like I like
you're just jealous bro okay I'm not the
I I might I might end up um going
I just because they are like very on so I just might end up just going east coast park with them and cycle with them
cause the rest all useless
no they're supposed no they're supposed to help me ya like okay then they're like no it no it's not it's not okay cause I need to know
when there are free like if you tell me a date like you know how how like if I if I suggest something then let's say like
everybody say okay then the one person who didn't reply suddenly say oh I cannot on this day then why you never tell me in the first place
who says like whatever you can just message me it's like
there's like no no no
then err that's why I just like just leave it lah never
I never go plan lah I just like ah whatever lah you all don't want to go then I also don't want to go uh I go with somebody else
you know did syazwana what
okay lah I don't know I don't even oh ah actually you know I don't even I don't even like
really like vibe with them like you know like vibe vibe with them
but at this at this rate I'm just like whatever I'll just like do it lah
whatever it is I'll just try
oh I might not you know I'll just like
basically what I'm saying right now is also just to fill up the
right whatever I'm saying right now is just to fill up the conversation so so sometimes I'll just say bullshit but you know it's not actually
just trying to fill up the the one hour
why does it feel why does it feel so much harder to like talk about
ya
or we can sing another thing we can sing okay lah sing oh no it's not singlish what if we sing
we are
okay then
are you kidding me
are you kidding me she has five bikes from who from where
oh my god dude I will go with faz and you
and afiq okay forget about amar okay if amar don't want to go
why
what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also
also he
when I talk about the food then he want to go
so what it just doesn't add up
are they all adult size
where is her bike where she live
how we supposed to bring jurong jurong west bikes all five of them to
west coast has uh is there any does it have a good cycling
because I know one is very good
are you mad
I I don't I don't mind lah but I haven't exercised in so long I think I can pass away
I scared like one as I I just one the like the chances of
one out of the five of us probably will have like
hey guys I cannot already
you know ah west coast west coast east coast is
it's going to take a whole day you know
um
I want I want I want I want I want I want to go I want to go
okay then I just ask afiq
that
but does
does fazirah want amar to come
okay so so if anything just four of us ah
huh really ah
really
I don't want I don't want
I know but
is not huh
how do I put it
I wouldn't be comfortable
like like like okay I'm sure he's a he's a nice dude and stuff but
not like I don't not like him just that
it'll be more awkward and I'll have to like
ya
okay lah
you all somebody has to plan it's always like
it's always like when somebody says something like I want to go here then everybody is like oh ya ya okay I ons I ons everybody ons then nobody plan
it's not my bike so faz has to plan it
ya
I don't know member of parliament general election
was it I don't know I anyhow only
I don't know what's that
ya I'm not sure I'm in a group yet
mine mine when I message the person she said
uh I'll be added to the group
on
monday
I think
I'm not sure
maybe
but I already got my location
ya
oh I got my dates on eighth and and eighth of july and eleventh
ya you got what
you got nine and ten ah
wait isn't voting day just one day
I don't know actually
pioneer some people will vote on the ninth and tenth
so what do they do I if I setup on the eighth who's going to setup what on ninth
that's election officials that's that's not us we are doing setting up only
by because I know because my sister is
err election my sister-in-law is a election official
that means she'll be probably be there manning the polling booths lah the voting booths
ya she told me cause she she she also does the
does the she does the safety distancing ambassador thing like she goes around
like hawker centres making sure people practise safe social distancing
eh hello
of course lah
err no
I don't know got
if you go hawker centres they have as in like in groups of five cannot mix with another group of five okay for example
because got no safety distancing ambassadors there and everybody's an idiot
ya exactly they say groups of five go out then after that they go more than group of five groups of five they get corona then
serves them right
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
eh I feel really good about liverpool ah about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck ah
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically uh you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two what
so
you try to
collect the most points
err then the most points win lah win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically uh mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
err point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early lah so so to speak
it's it's fair lah as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good lah
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
err but you still have the remaining matches what
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
eh wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four oh my god not thirty ah forget ah forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so oh my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams ah or some or forty or twenty teams ah twenty plus teams lah not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided what
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
it means you don't compete in the premier league anymore
and then
the one in the lower division league their top
three
if I'm not wrong top three their top top three teams will go up to premier league
ya
so
that's how a season works
how's it so hard to understand
okay uh right now it's like fifty four
err
mm uh
oh
sempurna dan
okay what is sentence in malay
ah
ya then
um
berbual dalam bahasa melayu yang baku
like it's like compartmentalized already my brain like if I speak
like formal malay like no english words will accidentally go in but if I speak like
slang malay like accidentally english words you just go inside
like unconsciously
I think I know what you speak malay I speak english
is or or we can can we even do that
is it is it alright like
but they said
err speak in full sentences
of malay
as in you are speaking full sentences
what do you mean by you make a lot of some
you know what forget it let's just stop speaking speaking in malay anymore
but that was not bad lah huh
my malay not bad what just now
but it's still proper what
what do you mean it makes sense
eh should we stop now
okay you just continue your continue your thing
they're always hiring dude
like almost all the time
as a what as a keeper
don't want lah
ah are we going to stop the recording now
okay let me check the instructions see what
you keep talking
to just fill up the the the conversation lah
I think we can just end it lah ah
okay press the red button okay ya on the count of one on one okay like just now okay three two one

and this is wafaidil
pretty good you know and it's uh it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family uh spending I just spend today at the beach in sentosa and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study err this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you hady what have you done for this weekend
um personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant lah I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless ah
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill lah looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
um one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand ah for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
um in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us ah cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it ah it's always err prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like ah fighting off against the heat ah and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
okay my
um me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid lah and
me as being someone very err
very err
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free ah cause I didn't ask to be born with err bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on ah for you know countries like switzerland providing eh countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their um their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also err adopt that err value of err taking care of their people's health lah
and providing certain free services for like I would say certain be better cause
err we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question hady um
it may be seem out of context but um if you could have one superpower what would it be
mm after much consideration of like
ah me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think ah do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind lah through through their eyes lah basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard eh hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark ah and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
err back to you hady
you can just listen from afar right
hmm
ya yes of course you know err
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to err give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind lah cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya lah
ah
where you see something once
um this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be hmm I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking ah cause
err food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
err ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me lah to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my ah
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
err I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
err
I'm err I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household err and um
somewhat lacking in the social department lah cause
err it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
err
we just uh interested in different things lah
so that's just me and my err life relations lah
you know
hmm me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated lah cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single ah intricate detail of like
explosions um err hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
um if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables ah cause
err
nearly all my favourite actors ah actors and actresses are in there my idol
err there's also
err people like
err rocky ah
ah he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie ah
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance ah
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
um diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
ah the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions lah of
in a love lah
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush ah
mister johnny depp he has a very err mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie ah I would say
err but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his err former wife eh ah by amber heard
it's kind of sad lah I just wish him the best ah
you
hmm so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps oo because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar ah I relate to um my johnny depp cause you know
well
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters ah eh small horses ah
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea ah
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school ah
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea ah and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and ah another item I would say is probably
hmm
probably a note to myself from the past err you know lah
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know lah like what's your future self
err you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing ah basically a reality check from the past ah
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more lah cause
ah as for you hady what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste ah putting a note together
take ah
you want me ah one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes ah
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars ah people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me ah
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
um like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
ah I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time ah
of course err
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
err ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert lah
um me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes ah and
uh I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things ah that
I would wish for ah
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you hady
what would you wish for
um those are very good wishes ah your first wish makes me err seems like a very stingy person and selfish ah cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself ah
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that ah cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone ah so if you could
I would suggest you err be the owner of liverpool instead ah
fair enough ah
oh that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat nasi lemak
cause
uh actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
the remainder of my life ah
probably nasi ayam penyet ah
it literally has all components I need ah
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
ah there's always cucumber which is good
err of course lah the primary part ah
of course lah the
um primary part
of the dish of nasi ayam penyet which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body ah
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so hady if you could eat one dish what will you eat
hmm
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
I would want to be a
err I would want to run my own radio like um
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to lah cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to um
err prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch ah they very humorous
and
that ah that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
ah started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
wow
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
um another job that I would be
probably the law law sector ah
err
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment ah
that give him the proper um
punishment
they can be bought off ah
err you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense ah
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize lah
justice ah over anything
and for my third job ah
honestly I would want something social lah
so perhaps
err
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know lah cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
err err a hobby of mine which I like ah cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently ah so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly lah if the people macam
you can learn
how to deal
back to you hady
hmm
for me personally
from what I've seen ah
eh
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body ah cause
err I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
err I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
you know
um
um
good looks over that one ah
cause they also keep in mind that they want
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them ah easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
that's what they say ah how about you hady what you think
there there's no point if you have good looks
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality oo then that's what I would choose lah primarily ya stick to good looks lah
okay err passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it ah so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind ah um kind ah does a heavy toll on us ah
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
they just avoided ah like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
err raising awareness lah I would say err to this type of issue ah back to you hady
oh
hmm ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya err okay time to turn err time to turn to happier pastures ah from this depressing err fix err
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
um
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport lah
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of err electrical buses
very green ah
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide err you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country
and ya something that I'm proud of being singaporean is I think an effective and also green public transport
yes of course hady we talked about certain questions and

so hello I'm I'm went from the toilet ah sorry ah for the wait
so like
ya what what were you doing ah meanwhile
ya ya ya ya oh ya it's sedap mania oh cheap ah really got what flavors over there I feel like going there again tonight leh
oh
bestnya
oh ya adam I think most likely ah
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
ya
ya so
oh oh
oh ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive lah
thailand
um ya so
I see I see
ah ya
ah
ya
adam needs more convincing to do lah
ya
err anyway
K
hmm
oh ya hor eh but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says err um
have you heard of ah what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there lor check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces wah shiok sia
actually we can two person share one what one person six piece six dollars okay sia right
ya so
satay sauce soup base I was like wah that's kind of cool then maybe we can
mm mm
oh
me ya
I I also don't know lah I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares tau so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya um
um
mm
I see I see
but how much ah the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
mm
ya ya
new um way
so
so
right kan
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity lah because like you know um
eh not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward lah for
that's why I think err
ya possibly because um even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
um maybe there's one thing we can consider lah
so ya
ya so
ya
so um
mm
okay um
I okay
I will try my very best to convince him to go
ya
there also the vibes like very nice you know
mee sua
ya I mean
ya worst come to worst me you adam
ya
ya
ya but the cheapest is two dollar per fifteen minutes
ya
ya
okay um
ya so
ah ya lah
um
so um
okay so we can review about I don't know
business ideas
huh
ya
ya
I don't know lah
oh oh your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
oh okay okay
oh
oh
oh
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine ah
I I'm wondering uh honestly curious
oh interesting eh psychology
wah
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify kan
ya so maybe lah it's the it's the same person lah loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
oh mother's gossip
uh maybe we should help lah we should help please tell
so um it's important lah to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized lah in
ah ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday lah
ah sentosa is it
that's how ah we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
so um sentosa maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar ah
you know we can just hang around at sentosa sentosa I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts lor
ah yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort serapong can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say lah they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
oh ya ya how much is it ah
I'm not too sure I really don't
oh ya we can do that also uh I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
err um can lah I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
ya as in eh as in the the timing also lah
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
can also lah because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
err let me see eh err
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
I I don't quite understand
so many rides lah but I think it'll be different
madame tussauds
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
twenty err twenty token
okay um
hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
there is uh another one ah gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
ya I think it's okay ten token worth it one hour seh one hour we can it's a very long time lah not bad seh
ya don't have their have eco adventure but I don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and sentosa and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
ya lah we can oh got mega adventure park um
ya so we ten ten so we get to take err two different attractions lah which I think a bit quite nice eh some more plus cable car then after that
ya eh what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
aiya I guess not too sure but okay lah we can check there out we can check that out some more I mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so I mean we we can see lah what else we want but I think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then I think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in sentosa just by the segway
ya so okay lah so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
err
it is the nearest station is tiong baru
and I am like wow not bad not bad not bad interesting

or one mega jump then
err actually we can do the also lah the is ten token
you know it's not bad ah usual price twenty two dollars
eh actually this one better if you want we should go for the sea aquarium tour ten token then the other ten we go mega bounce lor
ya more better than one hour jer

or marrybrown or or or we can just go ce la vi eat aspirasi mah
we can go the ce la vi hawker centre eat the aspirasi
so we can just ya we can just probably do that lor
so oh my god
um
ya two o'clock
oh okay lah actually we plan for three so two is a buffer time
I am not sure but okay lah even if we okay let's say we meet at three

I guess that's a need lah not a wish
but the thing is when I watch your when I watched that video that you uploaded kan it's like a it's a live stream but the thing is sometimes all I want to know is if I'm not playing that game I wouldn't know like what you are trying to do kan
because right how I can relate is like you know those there's this kind of channel or video and err where you watch people eat
because I think I watch the live stream not the edited one
just you just now you say about the spiders suit right I was thinking
I don't know just now err
for your suit jer
include ship
how long you need to wait for
I don't know whether you want to get for the kids cause they will grow very fast
he can wear the puffy one ah
how about the brother
what about the mum mother what we have a tripod for what
K lah faster lah you order for me and then you order for safi also lah
I want to wear the gwen okay that's the only character that I can wear right
spiderman series lah kan
then I just pass it off as spider cat ah
the one that you say oh black cat right spider cat is the we just created a new character
just created a new character no I think he followed me ya he followed the style of conversation no but you ate cheese fries already yesterday oh ya I'm supposed to cook the soup first
ya for dinner then at least tomorrow you can eat it for lunch lah
the thing is I don't know whether I ah actually I want to take half day I got
no I wait the following week is not christmas right
ah I will take next week actually
because I got one more half day I never take wait let me think
oh gosh I don't know because next tuesday I already on leave kan maybe I just take this friday lor next tuesday is for its for appointment what
wah I don't get it seh how did you even accumulate fourteen days eh oh ya because she she doesn't need to take leave like me right
wow what a plan
I wish I could say that
ya that's the thing because you your contract already said you need to clear you need to give it two months notice that's why you you have that mind mindset that you need to save them
oh
during his first year birthday eh wait but that is last year but then how come this year my leave exhausted I think it's because the the sick or when they are sick I keep taking leave at the start of the year
then can we buy like two so one is on the left one is on the right
so the alternative is either we change the sink or we build a
serious I thought he called somebody
father in law
were we even there I was not there
what a shitty experience
was the EX1>bangla< paid
aiyo I'm just thinking
okay lah no no I'm not even thinking of renovating the toilet
then the is the end product nice
no I mean like dan house
you can just ask what
like that
huh
no I mean especially if it's if no surprise to see talking about surprise that's the thing sometimes right it works err in your favour sometimes
not hot pink lah like the like the lighter one like a bit more pale
the app no lah that one champagne gold lah ya ya ya correct correct correct ah like that
ya that's the only cause the master bedroom you know I don't think I want to change anything maybe maybe just the part ah change to a bigger no the thing is right no no no let me just explain I want to use
projector you know that one no you know they have this technology where you bring like the kind of like tissue box style and then you can project the thing when you have it's not a torchlight it's a projector
like the the torchlight for the story book eh
gosh
h
no but that's the highest I could go I couldn't and then what I need kan
no the the photo they want it to be the resolution when you port it to photoshop kan is in three hundred but my the the camera that the G seven X camera at my office the highest you can go is hundred and fifty or hundred and eighty the point and shoot
camera our phone cannot set raw kan raw image file
what iphone can ah
four A is small kan
aiyo
I'm just thinking what should we have what shall we eat for dinner already cause I know but that's for the kids
oh
so in the end you pick up what time
oh
sensitive eh
it's okay ah
that's very good that's a five star rating for the delivery man
eh sia lah
why ah
oh right right right um I remember um they asked me to rate that time ya rate your delivery person
oh right right right ah I remember err they ask me to rate that time your rate your delivery person
oh
I don't know some people they they always say err you always have room for improvement so they always give four point five I'm like what the heck tell me ah where is the room then they always like oh you know we cannot give perfect score because you know we must leave some room for us maybe that's why I know I know
huh
beat it ah
beat it ah
I can't remember maybe maybe I think my reaction was the same as last time ah
it's harder to
is because of the figure of eight
crank course not crank course lah plank
the crank course is ninety degrees kan its like U-turn lah
no I thought that one only for the first lesson only
only the first lesson kan I don't know lah I'm just thinking whether I should take class two a
drink this water or not
from last week lah that I am that's okay what it's just water
huh what do you mean
doesn't correspond with the job ah
huh
ya how much how much did he did he quote
um
right
ya lah
okay but that that is not her problem what is the deal ya is the deal between the father and ya you guys what like he has no right to intercept what who told him
there is another company if you all want to consider ah it's quite easy video ya work not bad lah but maybe the okay but you also not going to stay there but if you want to do them a favour you can check it no but will will will you will you even like speak to them about the like if they need any video
eh is it because of the the payment the changes oh that sucks
serious compensation as in like discounted lah oh my god and is already like at the low you all only you all choose the lowest lowest vendor get the most out of the smallest budget
I see that lady that is going away she is stepping down again
wow so this event is to commemorate her stepping down lah what oh the the election
moment ah
right
fourteen upcoming members as in new members
new and existing I don't understand what do you mean total is fourteen so now you have how many oh
wah so actually I want to know what's the criteria for you to become a board member
I mean you must have you must be earning some form of money because she is a board member right
see that's why I want to know because if you are a working staff you don't qualify to be a board member already what
right
the broth
tayoh
it's very everything is important you know when they say like oh everything is urgent
maximum I can bring you is to the door but to open the door right you need this key and this key is a degree
then they will be like oh can lah shah you know I would right but I could could not I cannot ya sia really I always give this kind of then they will say shan stop trying to be clever I'm not trying to be clever if I'm clever I'm already your boss
then they just laugh
because if I start on it I cannot do anything else and everything else is urgent so by the time I get this for this scheduling I cannot finish it ya and the deadline is tomorrow wait is today the deadline today is thursday right today is the deadline

like ya because what if you know
oh
properly ah ya
oh K K K ah
mm
first ya
real relationship
ah that one stupid ah
that's kind of long sia
that's like two years later eh
but technically speaking if he comes back to you after two years right I think you would have moved on sia
I think you would have moved on already
like now you're in the process
for you for him it's easy
because guys will have the mindset that they can get everything they get they want
serious serious they they can they will use that
ya
ya
ya
mm
the thing is you don't know that's why
exactly
oh my god
astarghfirullahalazim
no sorry
yes
for sure lah correct correct
mm
that one ya that one mm ya that's the truth ah
izuan is like
he came into the picture later exactly
maybe ten percent ya
I'm not supposed to tell you
I mean you cannot tell lah but
okay you get the feeling
oh
ya exactly
I mean if you moved on already what can you say
okay if caring okay
err his kind of
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
he talks to humairah about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say oh I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
ah
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope sia
mm
never ya just dont care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future maybe will
ya exactly
ya lah
she got cheated
oh my god
like just like that
oh my god
ah ah
she straight up said that
break up
oh okay
so they are still together
serious ah
mm
I mean
for you
right
ya
ah circuit breaker
ya it's very rare to like find guys who are less
you know have that
ya
high hopes eh
mm
mm
oh ya
why
oh okay now I get it because
okay lah now getting because I think he say because split I do number isn't ah linguine with me to select and mulberry is opposite lor
but did you tell him that
alah
ah
mm
so cute
but like if a guy if you know that he feels like that right
now what time
but what can he do so
mm
it's okay
it's okay
he does trust me
you told like so vaguely you told him what
okay I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad thing but
I mean ya you're kind of fast lah but
rather than him might as well you go for someone else right
ya exactly
you're right
huh really ah
straightaway the answer legit would you like to
would you like to have that
that that has been my conclusion all my years
you know that mirah tell me you know like okay
oh okay okay sorry then we were going home right
ah
then after that she asked me like have you had a boyfriend before
that was like somewhat close to
uh dating ah
then he told me
ya then like the reason was also so stupid
okay no I'm I'm not stereotyping lah but
I mean isn't that
she told me that you know umirah
she said she knows that some
the guy bought
kan
can you imagine if I tell izuan that
I say that
even if like there's there's plenty of guys asking me for it
I wanna see his reaction then he will be like very annoyed confirm
kan
ya sia
oh huzni texted you while we were talking that one
I'm not the only one wearing like that what there's other girls also who wear like that
I'm just saying ya
ya
ya you I look at you then after that I was like thinking
what the hell
ya the one he said when you were what what made him talk about it ah
ah
I mean it's your opinion on what you wear what
you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay I understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then I lure guys into doing it
eh you wah shit sia cannot sia like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if I I asked husni you know
like it's way before
and then err suddenly you say
then he
okay that one was okay I understand he say that
that is nice if he said that
ya I told you ya it's yesterday
then after that I obviously I um
err
then after that because that irfan guy right he commented he
he talked to me about my picture
the one that I put
ya
because it's all black you cannot see the shape
oh so so like what's the problem it's just one line
if you
if guys also do that we can see what if I ask husni to do husni also have what
mmhmm

she wasn't inside what
she wasn't inside what
ya
kan like what's what's wrong with with what I wear

actually okay
oh ya
ya
for real
okay I guess I I am I am like that to a certain extent

not even teenagers it's it's like
I mean it's it's it's kind of like kids that is like I think O A level

I think the last time I went malaysia was a few years ago though I cannot though
eh really
how long was it
you gotta be kidding five minute

ya ya ya ya I know I know I know I know
ah
wah I didn't know it was five minutes it's like
what wah oh my god that is incredible though
maybe not one hour uh ah maybe maybe not I don't know I'm not sure ah because from like
I guess the traffic was good
I I mean there is traffic in the air during COVID time
but I but I see so many plane fly at the same time it's not COVID
of course if I go there I go for leisure
bro oh my god where's your

I
are you kidding me
J L

as in like the
five kilometres
the reservoir is six kilometres you know
ah ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
no no from the expressway
expressway I mean if you don't know
are you sure
ya ya ya
um it's I guess it's um
ya ya ya but I wouldn't say it's behind lah
ya
ya to the side ya
for real
hmm
hmm
uh ya
ah
gosh I hate myself
wah
because there's two short cuts
that's why bro what the hell
oh my god
how how dumb ass can you be sia
what bull bull ass is that I don't think that's a good reason though
I
ya
ya
oh ya
you wear this strong enough to you ah can react how which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
ah that means because of the tsunami and earthquake that is inside madinah and makkah
so the
so
ya ya ya ya ya so exact obviously it's a school trip so obviously you have to learn about all the
not not even the worst bro because it's because I think that's
are you sure
I see I see I see
oh I know
kan but I mean
you know I was like thinking how can I be so lucky to be in this country in this religion in this like family
I'm like
what a what a blessing sia so much blessing in one time tau
ya
it wasn't a couple years back
but a few years
ah I see I see
pandemic
but
but it's not as bad as this oh that one was it before SARS or no
I think it's before SARS
mm
ah it wasn't
oh
I know it was a big thing in singapore ah but it's just for what because we were
eh is there I'm not sure though is there I mean I don't think so if I'm not wrong they say there isn't any
it looks a like flu ah like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
kan kan
kan
kan
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though
kan
ya
community hospital basically
yes not for surgery kind of thing
ya it's also
ya ya
yes yes yes
ya that's why
ya
that's why
ya
ya but in the first place there is so many
ya
expats expats
I didn't know expats were okay sorry expats ya
ya
true true true
oh
oh jurong island
ya then that's why that time ah I don't know don't know whether it's a
should be lah right
ya
it's not good ah
should be lah I don't know
oil right why is oil good
that's the thing
ya

if that day right I already start uh applying for jobs on this uh
fast job app online then a few of the jobs ah like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but uh because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will uh record and then they will see then they will pay
mm
mm but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
mm
ah
so basically you just have to rate the uh display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
oh my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy paiseh right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come lah it's just that they don't know who only right
oh my god
but imagine ah if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then ah another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the um it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that uh she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company lah but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya lah anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good lah it's three times a week only
mm permanent part time but they need it uh long term
uh shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so it's quite convenient what it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
mm
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already mah
uh the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff lah
mm mm
so just anyway just send lah just see how
but some of them ah don't even bother to reply
one six months ah six months to one year you know
and then uh they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose uh the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar eh
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that err also I think it's mondays to
eh it's alternate days eh
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week ah
actually they will give us uh every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
ah rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit lah and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification lah I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because uh according to the rule you cannot do that lah if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically ah you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard uh my ex company
some of the pinoys ah they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these uh factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra uh I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms eh and then I think there's uh three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people lah
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely lah
and
so he said uh sometimes they dabao then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part lah
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean lah then I'm like eh but you are using the toilet also eh
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent eh
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also lah
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit ah that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent lah you cannot um anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have lah because um they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and um I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go lah I guess but then
ya lah like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the uh advertisement right or the job uh post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency lah
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best lor
but then six thousand eh
I didn't know that uh all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K ah I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks ah sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure ah when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo ah is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental ah can
give her like four five K per month eh
because I have friends who married ang moh right so expat ah
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month ah you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already ah
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses lah I mean like um
as male bosses are okay
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
err the husband is paying what why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always ah book first book a travel first
then got one time ah suddenly the the secretary call me and say eh how come my boss ah the krisflyer point is um
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this uh relocation company
the wife redeem uh free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part ah they didn't even uh say anything to me you know
then after that uh until I ask again ah
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also paiseh ah I said oh ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the uh points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim lor
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only uh get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible one ah that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see lah you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket ah you must tell them this one ah if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay lah not that much ah
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot lah because this is obviously your mistake
for us ah the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault lah because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright what how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary ah especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either ho chin minh or hanoi
so in the end I think you must have booked him on lah because only these two fly direct what
ya
ya lah very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch ah it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date lah so at least eh
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means ah the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel lah
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate ah
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already what
you can always book um through
all these third party from the website lah no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes ah hotel themselves even though they give uh they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in what
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course lah right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people ah
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least ah you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one ah family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because uh booking from third party ah I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday uh sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but hong kong passport don't need visa what
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival lah always uh tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
mm
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes ah you just
can you imagine ah if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then ah I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company uh based right
oh
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity ah anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it duh
ya just put out your resume first ah
mm

okay I starting now
work
then I go eat with you
can can go ahead
eh you know what I the my first case right the patient was very like

ah
a'ah
lah
ya
oh my god
syarif syarif malaque eh oh okay
I see
ya correct ya I mean nobody really turns on the
no
ya so it's like err I I mean I don't know is it cause it's very peachy
ya that one was quite interesting
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to oh okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says ah which is very true everything is on demand
ah
oh my goodness
I mean ya it's true I mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to right
or something like that
I'll try to put my phone
K K I put my phone here okay ya
oh ya what finance
oh yes yes yes cool
oh a partner
oh err wait
oh true true true
ya then I will find a partner
let me try my husband
oh
ah ah ah
ya
haiya if like that then
like that jannah and I meet up lah to do it
then like that there's no issue about it right
ya can also then it'll be like a meetup hangout
ya
sounds good
ah
okay
ya
pessimistic as in about your relationship
uh huh uh huh
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
oh okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house what
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
ya
mmhmm
ah
ah
I don't know but ros also
oh like you yourself okay
mm mm
mm
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole lah also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's you know what can happen
huh
a'ah
ya
what oh no but eh five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya lah there's your savings
dope okay lah hundred plus
okay eh then okay eh not so bad eh hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan ah is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
mm
mm mm
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus lah
mm
ah ah
ah
ah
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from kan
ah okay okay can lah
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
oh no
mm
mm mm
mm

like da da da and
actually I think can what
as in like as in a green light
you you won't get retrenched firstly cause of your seniority and then secondly
I don't know I mean if he this this would be the perfect time to see if he if someone can support you lah through difficult times kan
but I think it's just you lah you just want to you know make make sure that everything is perfect before you enter any serious commitment
ya now I have to try and change my earpiece
cause it's running out of battery
ya it's very annoying
so I hope it work
inshaallah lah eh now where is my
earpiece

eh there
cause this stupid google pixel a'ah google pixel

ya
so I have I have some time to myself
my mother-in-law my mother-in-law wanted hanan to like stay over so we just do it lah
okay

okay let me try again so now I'm attaching my earpiece in
okay ah this is another wireless earpiece
please lah work please please
okay
okay good good good
ya so I will get
ya correct
I'm very lucky already still want to complain about my son I think about sending him all the time
crazy ah
he is I don't know I think he is
ya he he has his moments lah but he's becoming so naughty ya ya he like just the other day he falls off the bed tau
ya did he he he rolled off the bed
ya
so now we are trying to put him on the mattress
then you know I started baby proofing my house
ya so got the baby lock lah you know by the drawers you have to ah pull out and things like that ya but hanan figured it out like he plays with the hook
then he he he saw me doing it and then he copied
that is wishful thinking
okay lah

okay good good good ya this earpiece is a lot better than that stupid airpod keep running out of battery lah
I didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct

mm mm
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
eh actually you don't need lah you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya lah
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that lah but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya lah a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the
I think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at then I feel it's really worth it
that to me ah

it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see lah inshaallah lah and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee lah like um you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me lah they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
ya
ah
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
his family I mean his sister asked me lah I told his sister lah the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
ya
like he got his temper
ah ya I told I told his sister ya
ya
hais
ya lah this is
eh you know that used to be me but now I'm like haiya I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
he's okay if cause for hanan right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually hanan is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work what
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also lah but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like hidayat will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
ya lah but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
but like plain
no salt no what
now um next week ah
ya
ya hopefully
maybe
huh I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
hais
ya
the only one for a long time
oh my gosh
ya so he
he's going to do it at furama err this girl is from she's doing ah I think it's his schoolmate or something
ex schoolmate so she studies biomedical sciences
ah
cause of the cause of the way he responds
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
I don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research
nazreen is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister lah they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya I saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause nazreen works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely
ya but then the girl works at so you imagine
huh serious
serious
mm mm
plus the set up all that which which is okay I I don't know I thought ya but then I think my degree was cheaper so but they got they got back quite a bit lah so in the end
ah
as in like okay lah
eh but still
you don't have to worry so much about the guests you can just
slowly take your time
mm
ya fifty is too little already
you cannot that means it's really just family lor
right if it's fifty your aunties and uncles already dah fifty people plus your cousins
ya

ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with aisyah his girlfriend aisyah aziz
it was okay lah but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like oh you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows what his girlfriend is aisyah aziz
like hello
oh mm mm
ya
ya correct correct
and the chemistry is just not there right
like
mm ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is dzar who carries the conversation right with the
people like razz will
a'ah
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually dzar can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no lah
din doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that oh okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least dzar has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting
ya

err ya ya ya
ya ya
where your farm lah farm farm
ya
ya
ya ya uh I don't know what is that called but ya the the buggy part
buggy
ya now I know now I know
you mean the wait you mean the buggy you want that big
oh
oh oh
ya like now like small
ya
okay just imagine a small house is already okay expensive eh then imagine a golf club
it's like
oh true
migrate ah migrate
ya
vacation house vacation
actually like staycation also can
ah ah ah ah vacation house ya ya ya like ya
I think like some people now also do like that
ya
um
no
never but but I ya I mean like now I don't have a lot of relative that stays um
ya so now like that's but then I don't mind I want to like have the experience
of like living in a
pulau ubin eh
is it like the model and I think
is it like the modern one ah I think I think they have I I think I got see before maybe not a lot lah maybe like a few
because I don't think it can last very long
eh then must wear shoe in house
my house lah my house
okay for me I like
leaning towards modern side lah kan
um I would love um private property lah
but ah landed landed property
but that's if I can afford it lah kan if not then hmm maybe
just a ya
ya dream my dream house you see
ya
because I just wanna be so that you know cause I like to have uh gatherings with like either like friends or family so I I like this kind of like interaction with the loved ones
ya so
ya so like exactly so that our house don't be like so like you know very quiet or like very like everyday like that
you see like that same same faces same like ya
ya but I mean it would be nice lah but of course the maintenance wise is different
so if I were to downgrade my dream house may um
um
I don't know eh because now the houses in singapore like small right like the house like very small so like
I would look uh towards the resale side resale house lah ya
ya mm
cannot get bungalow get that one can lah
ah like like jumbo like that ya that one also nice ya but again if I can afford
but now
ya I I heard it's still okay ya see the area also lah
I don't know eh wait
jurong that side is what area
west then tampines east
then north is central north lah
yishun
ah okay
okay
I know but I confused with the north south east west simi ya
um maybe more towards
north lah and also east
ya the east side and north side
because I feel okay the east side I like I like east side because like there's like happening there
uh huh
okay
mmhmm
ya
changi okay
ya
can travel
oh to then go to batam oh
mm
sidetrack sidetrack kan ya
okay lah more more I don't know ah
hmm
to travel to central
uh actually okay lah okay lah ah ya north north hmm eh actually okay lah for me like okay if I look at my where my parents stay eh
um
north is nearer
I mean okay we are I'm at the middle ah I mean now like my parents living is at the middle
but I would rather uh go uh to north
east
it would be a very long journey home whether I take train or I take bus lah
is it
ah ya lah ya lah I mean like towards the towards the woodlands ah the bukit batok
ya especially like uh the the khatib and that one yio chu kang that one like for real I feel like tomorrow then I reach
ya but okay lah
mm I mean central is the best lah
I say like for a dream house right the house to be like
mm ya lah
oh okay lah okay okay ya
mmhmm
ya mattar is inconvenient those that have uh blue line is quite uh
no lah no um because my my area don't have any line what I mean like the nearest is purple line and red line
ya
so all the blue blue line is like so far apart
like for me
ya
but we still no dot
we still like out of the region
mmhmm
right
ah it's always the issue
executive mansion executive is dubbed mansion ah is it maisonette
it's this big
it's that category ah
so executive
okay
what
ya
mm
okay now now that kind of house is I mean like um now the normal house eh resale house already like half a million already you know
like like my area my area is already five hundred plus plus K already
ya ya my my house is uh reach half a million already like above
ya like above above ya
I mean like they of course they have thoughts of like moving lah but then
not at the moment
ya
four
cause it's very long already sia it's like
thirty over years
and
I think because it's not say accessible but then like it's like we live at central central
um maybe
I say like woodlands or what right it will take less than half an hour
ya but if like you go by bus or what usually
ya more than half an hour like forty minutes
ya then like my area there I think because like
I don't know
no not a lot of things I think because it's balestier so balestier like
I don't know ah
like the outside part lah
not my my inside part got a lot of like elderly
ya especially elderly ya
but that but that house like wow
eh what what
why were we talking about it just now
oh okay ya
so mm so I think if like other area
um
of course like if if there is I mean like executive I don't think it will be below
ya
ya
like I like go for it already seh
ya then I'll be like very lucky
ya so I would go with like six or seven
one million ah
dude that one I might as well I take landed right
actually landed and
if if okay if I were to take landed and
executive right I mean it's it's not really far apart what right
then if I were to like work even a bit more harder or wait longer then maybe I can get a good landed
eh
I mean that if like is what I want lah
ya
ya I think our area this the central central is like already
ya
ah
mm
okay
that's why ya
because like I mean like especially like in our generation right we will take even longer to like pay compared to our parents' time
ya I think our parents' time
ya
mmhmm ya ya ya standard
high already
well tomorrow I buy
ya oh my god
mm
golf club
oh
I think you can
mmhmm
uh then
billion ah oh that's wah
wah
means you would be the richest there already
I mean if you were to
ya
a pool of
ya oh my god
I don't think it will be a mini golf I think will be quite big already
ya I think you can like fit in a few houses
ya
you can have your own cafe there you can have your own like what arcade there oh my god
oh my god ya it will be so
mm actually
ya it's just it's just here lah because like you know here four room kan you can buy like a landed at
mm
mm I think so
ya that's why that's why people a lot go to melbourne ah
or go australia that area
considerable
then you get a garden a mini swimming pool I'm happy with that already
I'm happy with that
uh you like will confirm go eh like you know that you have a vacation like stay eh you can just like holler at me
ya
I I have I have a friend
then like she err
the she got a house
so like she was like saying
and the house is like err landed at
and the house is like err landed at then said eh you guys want to um go we can go just stay at my house lah
okay sure okay lah why not right I mean like ya
ah then after that we just like ah nevermind lah we just find another time ya
then now like all busy so like
ya exactly exactly
don't know lah when that time
the but that time like almost lah then after that like
alone eh because err the parents
err
was held back because they were supposed to go back for like some event
then after that she have to like go first then the parents um err
left her behind lah I think no ah I think she was with the sisters
ya but I but she say that time she go first then the parents because the parents drive
so like
so it's like
ya I mean like it's best if like you know we can go with her then like
hmm but then ah
ya I I think everyone will like
bye singapore no no population sia
every time all all like go to malaysia
ya
but but in order to I feel like in order for us to like live a good life in malaysia
like we need to work in singapore
like our income must be from here then then we can live a good life there
unless you work very hard there lah but then it's hardly also to see
ya true
cost of living if retailers you could do as I knew
it's like the same like we live um staying in singapore ya
it's like times three of what we earn know
imagine if you earn one K and there is like three K
mm
mm
ya
mm
mmhmm
woodlands so ah
ya
mmhmm
at
oh oh singapore oh okay
ah
ya ya
ya ya ya
no in the investment
ah ya
exactly like easy money ah like that ya
it's like um you know in when I was in uh in
like a few of my officer
that have like around err four room or three room
four room or three room then
after that uh
they they but they don't they never stay at that house
so they rent out to people rent rent to people ah so that one house eh
eh one I think one room eh
they charge um
ya they charge
I think one K
ya they charge around one K one K plus
so imagine and and full know full it's like okay that four room eh
okay so it's three room one hall right so that three room is occupied
then one person imagine one person is one K plus if I'm not wrong
then wah then really then he like doing for like four years already now then imagine how
how how much he get already in one year then plus his pay
then then he even like talk to me saying that oh I actually thought of like you know getting another condo
ya but I don't think I'll be living there lah I will rent to people also then I like wah
so much things to carry
ya but then like the money is good lah then like okay my that
that officer of mine is not okay is married but don't even have a child yet
so like
and he's like old already so I don't know if like they want to have a child or not lah
so I don't know like ya with that a lot of money what is he going to do with that
ya
freehold no
mmhmm mm
this for condo
some some of it ah
wah
mm can take over and stuff like that ya
mmhmm
ya
ya ya ya true wah
mm
mmhmm
what kind of like job they do like middle family because some some of them
is is for you actually you know it's though it's a gift or something like that then from there they like make it even bigger
ya you know like I want ya it's a I think like
um
some of like err my friends
like they they they mentioned
um what is that
like their family has a asset
actually I think for them or something like that so so they actually um
their their parents only get to
err release that thing
err to what is it
oh sorry like a lot of things going on in my mind
a lot a lot of things going inside the room
okay
okay so okay I let me restart
good family
ah ya so like their parents actually like put aside or keep this savings of theirs
like uh for them so at a certain age then uh it will be uh released to them or something like that
ya so it's like
so so for example right now they work right they work hard already they earn like so much already
then at uh one point of time
you would they would get this money
but then this money is either is up to them lah what what they want to use it as
so
uh
so
ya lah they
um
they they have plans they already planned what they want to do with that money
oh that one I don't did I ask them
ya I don't know lah they say like at a certain age I think they also don't know I think I don't know
so like ya
err there's nothing over here what is it ah
ah
then
then suddenly aman need earpiece
my earpiece oh is it this one is it your earpiece this one
oh ya about tell eh do what
oh well
inside the container
inside the container container is this the container
black colour
black colour below one
orh
where is let me see before you give it to him okay
sorry it's okay bye bye
bye
then
then
and after then mm ya lah I think there's a lot of like then and then and uh so and so
ya
ya so so he already plan out lah like what he want to do with the money it's either he
uh buy a like a big house or he start on his own business
not most lah I mean like a few I mean like uh I have this few friends only so like
most of them okay I just say most of them like um plan to do like a business
or like maybe like go like overseas or something like um like their business is like
to ah
to
err overseas lah so like
it's just that they need
the the time to like get their money and then right that's it
it's like how our parents wait for their
but this one is like even
ya and you don't have to wait for that age
to get it ya you know
I think like
like when you reach like adult like mature mature adult age ah then they will like receive the money or something like that when like the parents know that
oh they can
they are mature enough to handle the money lah
ya that they don't even think
ya they don't even think of like what job they want to do after like or like you know they they like oh nevermind lah just we uh see how it goes
I'm like we see how it goes
I see where I go
like ya it's like you never know like they like oh okay lah see lah I think I think my father um
the the the friend
um uh son got a business so they thought of like you know just uh taking me in and work for them then um like everything is like already there the choice are there so they just need to choose
them I'm like wah so pampered one ya
so ya I think this uh I mean like most of these people
they'll they will like mostly do this kind of like investment or what lah
ya
see their background lah
ya
exactly
then like they don't have to like really stress or like put pressure
ya
ya
mmhmm
exactly
mm
just nice
mmhmm
mmhmm
degree degree
actually right
okay continue nevermind
mm
ya
mmhmm
ya
mm different
it's like it's like let's say like if you
in diploma right
then you have to work like extra to reach
to reach um the degree pay
ya then for degree
will just like that
then
degree itself is already like
sufficient you know
I mean
I don't know actually diploma is quite sufficient already
just that whether
um
ya because like I feel like because uh I have this uh conversation lah with my um
senior
like he's doing teaching
so he's not um under err not really under
ah private or something like that but he go to schools lah to conduct
the classes so like
then with that time that money that you earned you actually can like do a lot with it
so like like he do a lot of like um he just keep on doing like uh freelancing and like volunteering work and like just like
to
increase his err rapport or something like that
you get um what is that
ah
ya then after that he just like sign up for this one thing then that that thing that requires like degree
recommendations also lah and all so like he said like ya actually you just need to hustle on that I mean if you want a easy way but
the the going through process is like hard
ah then you take degree lah I mean like degree also now
like I feel like
ah
I mean it's good lah I mean it's good it's definitely good for like future because like even like when you are at work age or what right if you want to do something
it's like
uh like a bonus point ah oh okay okay this this person got a you know
like experience in this you know
ya that's why I was like thinking then like hmm but then of course um I want to do degree lah but
see lah how it goes
oh my god
uh as at that time I check
it was for one year eh for one year degree is around two five
two five
two five thousand
ah if for that one year
for that one year
ya because um half of the year
it's um overseas
uh labrador labrador
labrador park
I don't know uh uh I know what's the it's at uh australia eh
I don't I I don't know what's that
ya then like
but it's like so crammed lah like they say that there's no time then you have to do like
thesis and essays and such like that and then it's like not not like a few hundreds you know it's like thousands of words
ya I mean like ya lah of course lah but this one is like you have to do like
singapore one set then at the overseas one set and you just imagine that
then like wah but really like hustling ah then that's not
the only one then they have to rush for their
project works ya project works then like their on come eh accommodations over there
ya I mean it's paid lah it's paid but like our expenses and some of other things you need to use your own money
so like wah
so that's why people like sometimes use bank loan and stuff like that
which is like scary lah
ya
then what when you want then after that imagine after your degree you have to pay back
there's that
exactly then
thirty plus lah late thirties
means that the older you get the the older you get your
the older you get
okay
I mean like when you want to give birth the older you get
the harder it is I mean like the guy
this one about mental you know and emotional ah
emotional and mental um
don't know because of what maybe because of health issues because you're getting older or what
then
eh you can't continue continue eh continue the tradition or the the the
ya
I mean like both their different
uh pros and cons um a different
ya
mm
mmhmm
I mean it's okay if like the girl is like younger
ya
mm it's okay lah
ah lah ah lah
I mean it has been like that for the longest time lah ya
wah then that one I like really have to chiong you know I mean like
ya it doesn't matter like age doesn't matter lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm mmhmm
mmhmm
ya slack off
ya
mm
because of how you take the things lah ah how you like actually
uh handle the situation
ya like more more like career minded
ya
the pride ya
ya ya
ya
ya
maybe it's a trend also where people hire more females
they are more towards the towards towards the career path
ya I mean like before before this generation already like
towards the career path lah
where be like the economy and such right so
mm mmhmm mm ya
ya
true lah
mm
I'll be like
ah that's the thing
as in like ah saving plan
but it's also like hard lah I mean like how if that if you get like one
ya
ya
mm
mm
mm
then how seh like that
mm ya mm
some like uh my friend
err
and be eh
two point five ya two point five then after that
ah got commission so let's say if like she
uh managed to like err sell something or this um particular plan or what eh to another company or what to an event
then she will get a commission of like another what one K plus or two
just imagine then wah she bring home how many already then like
then during this circuit breaker
like she still get her pay
but then um they give her more
she need to do extra
so usually like okay because like okay
the numbers of like uh workers also will cut down what
then after that the one that is being uh cut off
have have already have the thing to do so that that thing that the commission that the person has to do is brought forward to my friend
so she had to do double job in a way
ya so imagine like with her pay
okay lah her pay got uh drop lah dropped by a few percent only like not much
they've wasn't too which is cheaper
ah
I mean like if she get to sell um that's what the the pay pay the standard pay
mmhmm
so she have her own one and uh the friend commission
oh you mean uh the commission extra
yes
ya ya
mm
mmhmm
ah
like that ah
ya it's it's it's not it's not they combined the workload
so it's like macam if if combined also like if she managed to sell one thing
then she will get commission that one thing then if
if she go to the next list if she get to sell that next list then she will get another commission that kind
get what I mean
ah
so like now now she bring home like around okay
around three plus three plus four
err because like the err company really like cut into half
so so they have like two they they only have two um
two groups two groups of managing something
so now that one group
uh that two group is being cut into half and then they combine these two groups in a way
so it's like
because their their workload is doubled ah so of course their pay also in a way
doubled ah
amazing eh
like you like your leave you cannot just
then it like you really need to
ya but then she know ya that's why
but then she knows that
she need um income right so she stayed for a bit that's why the commission come in but then she say lah she say to the boss that
oh um you know um my my family is my first priority so if anything happen like if you need me
like last minute and I already have
uh a family thing or what
I will
I will not take up the work I will take up I will still stick to my uh family ya
they having this uh conversation and like this um argument and it's like about this thing ah then she said I'm so sorry I mean like
but then they know that they can't lose her
cause once they lose her then
no one would do that ah exactly
so they like try to like
what is that called accommodate lah
so like okay lah
then then in the end I don't know what happened but then she's still uh working there
but she said that she won't be err staying lah I mean like when when the COVID
thing gets better then like the pay don't get better then maybe like she'll go to another company or something like that but then again
the pay is already like
you know I mean I I won't I won't be
complaining ya
ya I mean if I would get that much pay and
I mean I already got the chance to like say um stay I never be like cut off then I really got like
then my pay in a way like increased because of the commissions
then like why why would I want to like complain even though that work is hard ah
ya
your what is that called
yes
getting better at this
ya a lot a lot
so
ya
that's why I think a lot of like people now want to like work really hard
and like have a stable life
will not have a
to go through like this uh
this like like what
we go through in a way but we don't know lah in in time to come like how it is like
a fellow let's say the future
ya exactly
but ya lah just that
I feel that now uh people work extra hard so at least they have something
to keep like in their that box
their treasure box
dead
their death box ya
so like really you really don't don't touch even like
even if got emergency also I don't I think they will try not to touch that money
I mean like unless
if the emergency is really emergency
ah
because because I know err I think err my my relative eh
so uh this saving eh that they have eh is for like emergency for like maybe
okay
urgent emergency
ya
eh don't be surprised I had my relative that got married at my age she going
she's the one like that you know
ya her her wedding supposed to be in two years
but that simple simple also need money what
then after that okay she have savings she have already have savings but then it's not enough
for that one year
weird okay
okay and they do not not together know like husband and wife
they do two separate wedding
so like the guy's side in a way I think is stable is okay
amazing but still like it's like lah I mean like
then then the mum on that day itself the mum was like telling us like
ah then after that into the point where uh where the mum have to step in the mum like
but she already
know that that thing will happen so she and the husband actually put aside and the father is actually very strict
then okay then that's a
that's why the father didn't know lah so of course the mum need to like mm twist here and there you know to make things like better
ya so like ya ah then the mum was like saying hais ah then this one also I have to like hmm
whole thing lah
so like if if the mum never help that wedding didn't happen actually
ya exactly I mean like you you I mean like throughout your life already like
burden already you know and then you have to err burden someone unless if your mum like your parents really want to fork out
like you know or help out ah
ah that is okay I mean it's like you know
ya it's like a gift lah a gift
ya
mm then okay lah ya
mm
ya
mm mm mm
ya I think it's
even my brother want to get married like want to make small small then she like
because like you know uh so we can invite more people like like her friends then he like stress
uh I think combine because the girl's family is a small family
because and she live in um
she has a family in malaysia and singapore so she she technically a
ya because she stays there
only she come here to work and also to meet the families here lah
and she have a family in singapore lah because I think the father or the mother is a singaporean
like not big so like so of course she said that she will only invite like those
like close one ah like the family in singapore lah
then that that that means right he really want to have a intimate wedding so with his side of place
then my mum like oh this is too squeezy then then later if I invite my friend like you know like mum's thinking like you want like you would want the friends to like
to share the happiness with the friends
then like he say but then who's getting married
he said ya then he like try to accommodate lah then my mum
try to understand also
but okay lah I mean like
different people different lah ah
ya like they they they know that okay uh this wedding
uh I want to do this for my child know I want to contribute err this part of the wedding you know for my child you know that kind of thing
ah renovation because like they are like getting older so like there are things that needs to be changed or what kan
like my this err aunty set like err
this big amount lah
ya but
mm
ya that's the thing
like some people join what this err what is that called
so after less interview of time
ya uh I mean no as in like every month if you like you pay
ah at a certain age then you can get the money the whole sum of money
ah
mm
mmhmm

times the months lah

but if sometimes like people know just have to go to another way
just to like

so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles one but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often
ya like that lor don't know how see first

I don't know see how like if I can get into uni then go into uni lah if cannot then see how start working first or what

two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy lah because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like um
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year what
ya
no
ya
ya
I also don't know see what have lah what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
ya
ya
no eh no preference
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
um
bake it
oh
the old chang kee one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the ondeh-ondeh and the red velvet one
ya the ondeh-ondeh one
but it's like
the ondeh-ondeh one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the ondeh-ondeh because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was uh on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
ya
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the briyani with the potato also can
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the bhatoora like in the morning eat very nice ah but also like really oily
I think they like I ya they deep fried or something
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
ah got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like oh maybe can make hummus then we eat with we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying ah so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first uh
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
kunafe is which one
mm I don't think I tried kunafe before but I think I've heard about it before
the is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first uh I think like
ah cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
oh ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at joo chiat right like err that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
huh ang mo kio A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W oh no that one is shake shack
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
ya but I think I like it ah cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
ya
ya
and uh
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know err during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for you know even their right the each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
so
ya
ya during december then err I also meeting like some of my err like
I want uh we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how lah because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed ah because like we all thought like err we all planned already and then like that night last minute uh that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her mah but don't know how lah see how
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel oh the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at jurong point anymore I only eat the
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
you guys can eat bingsu or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat lah but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things what
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it seh
if not
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
then
that time also
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people lah but you cannot like err four hundred dollars
ya
I think
err if not you can go bugis like the bugis haji area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to bugis street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's err like it's like affordable uh not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
err ya and then if not you can go to the that time the joo chiat
changi area
around her area
choa chu kang area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite ulu mah so ya
ya
that time I went with her at jurong east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like uh the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad lah but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
oh ya cannot refund right
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
huh if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go bali
indonesia
I don't think will have
oh I want to go the I want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one I always eat then I want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but
ya that one that one the mango lassi very nice
oh ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash ah
oh
I suddenly like I go back home right I like shower and then I was like okay and then shower shower I looked at the face wash area I saw like eh a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that
two face wash and then one pimple cream and then her perfume and her makeup stuff
ya
ya like I spray like my class nine eight right I spray right until like I spray like on my like on my because I was wearing like inner clothing then I was wearing outer clothing so I spray on the inner clothing on my body also until like
like
and then the lipstick colour also because like very
um like smokey maroon red
it's that type of colour
ya
so
like
I mean like I
I usually the one wearing red lipstick what you always like go for purple or like glosses more then
then it's like okay lah comfortable lah can can

eh play mobile legend leh you know there's a lot of updates now then like they revamp a lot of players and some more and and and and you know their their the players was not as toxic as it was before also
ya ya actually for kan they revamp
they revamp layla ya cause right I don't know
she really did
they that even in like during attic right the draft pick
a lot of people choose those
surprisingly ah ya
I'm totally not judging you
the fact that you spent
ya but then
but bro
for a skin
such a nerd no
but okay okay lah let's start playing
ya ya
ya
how to unfriend
how do I unfriend
why do I have such
a friend
but okay lah okay lah I
but then karina karina squishy lah bro but then
okay karina squishy
like at the start I always noob right then confirm at the start they will already say
a man of it the toxicity is not as bad as it was before oh but then ya and bangkok lah stop being a chicken dilemma
not bad not bad
the toxicity is not as bad as it was before but then ya
and
rank up lah stop being a chicken alamak err
where got I feel that level that time I saw you play okay what
okay what
okay the fact that you actually smash buttons I thought you actually did your research but I thought you nailed out on freya but okay
unfriend
okay lah
I keep on saying okay lah sia but okay
what okay lah
the rank the rank
I'm not judging I'm not trying to do it now but the fact that you already did a lot of research and thing it's a progress you can go up and up and up but
if you want to stay start then okay
win win the chicken dinner
invincible eh but if you want play fighter right I feel that okay there's this new fighter called yu zhong yu zhong
whatever
have another fighter eh but since you say you play freya freya right
freya freya has
why am I not surprised I am never surprise when it comes to this but
eh I really didn't know about the health spinning thing tho
wah okay okay cause right there was this like my team that time I play alone then I play with this one person
it's okay you can
you can you know improve that that ulti so instead of hitting minion you will hit
maybe three or four player you know
ya then
yet eh masha is not a tank masha is a is a fighter
ya I cannot tank
would you could that the
excuse me excuse me
eh walao I mean like okay I suck at new new heroes okay so like you know I'm I'm already comfortable with the heroes that I have
ya so it's like
ah
it went there there there there there it's okay
there there there there there it's okay
I mean it's true sometimes in life nah I don't know what to say cause like I ain't no therapist unlike you
but eh but if you play hilda or what then I just support you lor
but I'll be there okay I'll be there I'll be playing my marksman or my
ya
eh what other what other tank eh I feel that hylos also not bad eh
it's for you
ya hylos like ya
ya hilda and during
draft pick right they also
ya ya legit legit like they always did
or tank just odd ah and there's no one who'd ban hilda
so I think there's a good chance you can
but ya ya
they they ban uranus actually I played uranus before it's quite fun but
the surprising right they don't really much new players ya they bend your illness because actually you organise is a very thick thing
surprisingly right they don't really ban much new players
they ban uranus
cause actually uranus is a pretty thick tank
once in a while they will ban ling
ah ling
who they ban who I forgot
but now kan instead of two
they ban three each so each team ban three
so total six
players six heroes away ban
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay I really want andes I really want the fiery chicken oh my god okay I'm salivating
let's go find this but lunch lah
best pe
or like eh I'll be late
oh ya eh but wah the leave oh he's taking he'll be taking two days leave ah
okay now I feel very bad
ya whole day leave
lunch
no we're not bringing our rice cooker
oh
that's not happening okay we're not gonna repeat that
I can't really we bought a rice cooker for a staycation
okay this is such a
such a
feisty thing to say out loud
yes we bought rice cooker for our staycay previously and it was so it was so handy I admit though I mean come on man you gotta admit that it's very handy dandy
it's like what we cook maggi we cook pau we steam pau some more leh
okay okay no but we're not going to bring that rice cooker for sure
because over there right they already provide us with pots and pans
but ya we're not going to bring rice cooker
and no I'll make sure you don't bring your
freaking luggage
that's not going to happen because it's just
it's three days two nights so we're not going to have
a lot actually
I take that back I think I'm going to bring a lot of stuff also
luggage
okay okay then we
eh but the thing is we're going to eat lunch outside
dinner
it will be side tracked again actually in a way sort of
okay maybe not really
because right
okay I don't know
I'm actually imagining it right now
okay the fact that oh my god
haizat he fully endorsed it
I'm questioning our friendship why why are we friends with these kind of people
but
ya I wanted to mention that
pathetic
no I'm not going to do that
so it's like
the waking up though do you think
you think we will wake up easily
you nasty
okay lah if you don't you nasty
okay day two
in the morning we going to prepare some breakfast
okay it doesn't matter the order and then we going to do we're going to trampoline park
after trampoline park we're going to be all sweaty and disgusting we're going to go eat
I haven't do my research on that I ya I'm not as on as you
there's also I found one in ang mo kio before but I mean from here to ang mo kio is a bit like um but ya I thought if oh I know I know three one three lah
bounce kan ya bounce is there I don't know but we'll do research on that
but ya we can go there
eh but there's no shower place also right around the area I think we just change our clothes
then I just hope zat don't tell us to you know
go back to
you go grab home go back grab
but then like at the same time I feel like I want to fully utilise that
ya
eh I ya to what as in like you are indeed very correct because why why go out when you can stay in inside a cosy little
container with aircon with all the things you need like
youtube netflix
what why go out okay lah I mean okay we're such a
party pooper
ya but
hmm
I was speaking of grab I mean coming from someone who reaches
an hour earlier than the meeting time every time
okay you
so it's like I mean I'm not even surprised if your account is not even gold
or silver to be honest or bronze
or below bronze but anyway
I'm so on to stay in container also
but at the same time okay if activity mm
if cheap and nearby I don't mind but it's at promenade promenade I don't know it's that far meh
I think okay you know what we just see if there's any like places nearby in prom line problem is it depends ah okay so the first option
first
first ten
first day
we just
stay inside
second day stay inside third day stay inside that's the first plan second first day we eat
go up and trampoline
go out and trampoline
on the first day I mean okay the first plan right it includes the gym also
because technically we don't go out what it's just that we go to the gym nearby the container gym anyway
ya we go outside which is first day we go
we don't we we stay in lah we stay in then second day then we go trampoline park then after trampoline park we can go back to the container
I don't know what other activities we can play
I mean even if we two car bejewelled and everything we stable soap mah like we still feel very icky instead okay ya then
ya
then
ya or we can go cow play cow moo first or wherever lah that first activity that we do and then we go trampoline park
and then we end the day with
going home for going to the going back to your container for dinner or we just buy dinner then we dabao to container
do not talk about my winx club like that winx club
that's not a very nice of you okay that's very mean move what's wrong with watching that I mean you watch barney you watch other stuff also so okay like cartoons are cartoons they are like entertaining
oh excuse me every single time I refer something about spongebob you be like oh I know that one you sure you don't talk much okay don't talk so much
if you don't watch spongebob and it's all memory based then how did it came about that means you did watch spongebob
excuse me sir are you judging all those people that are watching my little pony
no but the thing is right
the thing is our staycay we haven't even finish talking
you know what

okay
mm
okay anyway
ah
minimalistic
minimalist
mm minimalistic
ah
ah
a'ah
okay you
ah
master bedroom
mm
orh
then
who know how to paint
hmm
frame
then
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
remember ah I want to make that wall I want to
what's that
they have the drawer
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
of anything ah
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway what
huh
mm
but I think
I think no need raised floor lah
then does it really have a purpose
then
quite isolated from the rest of the room tau to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
a'ah
and then the one behind behind the entrance
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
you understand or not
a'ah
ah a'ah a'ah
ah but we make it minimalistic ah
ah
mm
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble what
so maybe matching ah
mm
mm
which bedroom the small one
mm
master mm
the second one is the second one smack you okay then
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
then
you don't want to buy playstation meh
sure or not you don't want playstation
you don't use the space to the maximum you know
because it's triangular
mmhmm
reading room
okay but how how you want to do how you want to do that
mm
okay
ah
ah
ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
it's about knee length lah
the raised floor is about knee length
okay
mm
okay
ah
mmhmm
ah
L
okay
uh huh
mmhmm
mmhmm
laptop and all
uh huh
mmhmm
because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and
when you sit down you know
ah
ya so that one need maintenance
mmhmm
kan
a'ah
still
I'm in the same house what difference does it make
does it make any difference
I'm still alone
mm
let's scrap the swing no swing
okay why not
we switch the swing for
maybe one or two exercise machine
you tell me you want to buy weights what
we will
mm
then you no weights ah
sure or not
mm
okay lah
then
you'll never know
I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want
ee not helping
mm
because okay last time people use console because they got speakers got player now don't have already what all you sync to your phone want Netflix everything installed inside that's why you buy that kind of right everything is installed inside right so
by right ah by right you don't need console but we are buying console temporary because
so that's why you want to buy it from Carousell fifty dollar one
anything lah cincai
mm
ya lah
you choose a wall you choose a wall where you want your to be then we just stay like that lah
you choose you decide
mmhmm
ya
uh huh
no
the mount is not inside the inside the wall you know
no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
ya lah where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that uh beside that wall is already the window
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay
mm
okay
okay fair we can do that
you cannot do that you know
but if you want to move it
mm
uh huh
ah lah
mm
okay

where did he go like when when did he move out
mmhmm

but to me like what's done is done that was like a last month thing right
like the whole
ah but
he should have
you know
be upfront with everybody you about it right
wow
I mean of course
had anyone would would be pissed about that
so where's the guy now
ya ya
then his
then his things
right
but where that where can he go
I thought when he'll he'll stay with you cause he doesn't have he doesn't have a place
no but I don't
no but I don't have a place to go I I don't want to live in my mum's living room
alright I mean okay fair enough
but I thought he was
okay money
from his the other his
but
true
so what did he do with the money then
right
ha ha ha
no but that kind of behaviour right okay to be fair
he was my friend
a strangle
then you know you kind of knuckle jack hits a bit
wah man I cannot ah
but that's terrible ah
like
we are talking about like thousand two right or something
to be honest your rental rates is nonsense ah
you know
I would pay you five like like five six hundred for like
rental
ha ha
or there's
or there's an actual plague going on ha ha
okay so um about fahim thing
err
the other day
okay err
I'm going to say something about
brother herme
kan
right
ayip
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
and all that
then on the way back err I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
oh down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things ah
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
ah then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired ah
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
ah us ya
so um then he was saying how um
how did they go into it I
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
err
kan
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think hilmi actually supports ah no of course not
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do lah
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up ah
then he was saying how um
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that ah
so now what now is just
huh huh
it's
it doesn't feel
great ah
I was telling him ah like they are gonna
ah when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him eh I but mine wasn't cause of cheating ah of course
so
like if I was the cheater
in that sense
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit tau
ya
like normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
eh
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
hey brother
you should remind me to bring an cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
it it
singapore is very small
oh wow
wow that's that's going into the wrong direction ah
so anyways right
ya so um about that I think then he was
telling me that
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
fair enough ah
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch ah
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
like how do you defend
ah his his actions from a moral standpoint ah
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am lah kan
uh being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given ah
mm
I don't know that's a very controversial statement ah
so by those dates
you you describe it as um
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
to me that one it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender lah like that's true
right
okay
fahim isn't exactly mister olympia material himself pe
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the err
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life ah
at wah that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
wah I cannot
sial ah
brunei
eh no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
ah people in brunei
no I'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
ya
so like uh I was asking bell lah that time it's like why ah
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
ha ha
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying oh then she was expecting okay um one thing is
ah it's
that's A
B
err a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
but there's no tourism to speak of
free education free healthcare
right
I mean
but healthcare is not free what
ya
oh ya
so basically I was
I was talking about ah about ruqayyah and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
I think what you're trying to say in summary is that
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
uh huh
wait so there are
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
no no no no no
ah
you know
eh
wow
why does it sound mm
mmhmm
like it just physical
oh man
wow
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
how else you gonna get and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a revenge thing ah
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like I know we've known the guy for like forever
I never thought
mmhmm
now is what
fourteen years
no I never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya I never thought you with tino until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay uh marriage is like the big leveller ah
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
oh I haven't seen an iron board in years ah dude
what for
ya
mm
so anyways
I don't remember that
ha ha
wow
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier pe
don't care what you eat but the oh how many times you eat lah in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now ah
wow
eh is it
I I don't
is it
is it normal for your height I I don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing ah is it
oh no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the ah ang moh ones
ya ya ya result
white guys different ah
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
I mean we just evolved from different monkeys lah I guess
ah I don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
ah wait wait wait wait
eh wait wait
what were they talking about ah
that one
okay okay
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me
eh brother you are at low risk good job
ah ya your is twenty one point nine
orh without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the one doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference ah
according to this my is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think um I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
I think my my highest
my my my my peak ah
peak
no
my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos jer
right
I
I think I know which one you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
huh huh huh
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
mm
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it ah
ya
alright
in law no not yet so ah cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
ah german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course ah and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so um it's like things to do if the if uh for you know respiratory things ah
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing uh this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time ah he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit siao also
ah quarterly report or something lah
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message ah
saying that you know
um good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email ah
then then at then a while ago were like complaining ah how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
ah then
he will he told me he told me that first ah that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay ah this old man might might have been repeating his story again
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two ah
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like oh why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else lah right
then said no
he got COVID
what the fuck
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
um the initial thing was
they wanted to get married ah this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents lah of course
it's usually like a like a mother thing lah like
ya this kind of
ya so um and then what you call it ah then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that uh he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
islam ah
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it woo you can go on for like this ah but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it lah then I'm like
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also lah I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
eh you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy what
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
so
ya so anyway then um
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
wuhan flu and all that
ah chinese cough as they say
and then err
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and um
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow ah from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved ah which is fair
ya lah of course lah you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay ah mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up ah
then uh
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
ah and they were kind of
having some progress ah but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause uh kan they both work from home
like
uh my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
um
ya then ah he goes over to his place a lot cause uh K so my my parents live in bedok south right which is
basically near tanah merah right
then he lives at the condo at tanah merah
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once pe
ya
so she goes over there like every other day ah to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
ah okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya sia ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it lah
one of those guys
ya
and then ah she's there like every other day then um that day I kind of went to meet my mum
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of eh why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about uh that issue like my sister
um being over there lah what
and saying how oh
my mum
then
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do ah
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
so the best thing to do
ya lah exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time ah he talked to me and uh he brought me out for beers
ah I've got things to do ah
ya so I didn't
what
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course lah so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones lah it's just to like you know
ah ya
so anyway um what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
ah at first if his parents have some reservations ah about him
going out with a malay asian girl ah
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no ah ah whoa this just whoa whoa that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like ah muslim countries lah right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way tau
was it mm
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first lah

playing game
mm
huh
uh huh
then

uh uh

schedule
my body like need rest

I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
no ah but
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan lah at least
then after that
okay so
um okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post what
so obviously there's fan
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon eh
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan what
I doubt it will open
ya I miss I miss going there then like talking to the kids even though they are annoying
but I don't miss the managers
sorry ah like
ya that voucher
but you got use or not
oh ya ah
but you can ask him to follow you what

then
ya
true
like starting okay maybe the first first few weeks

ya so
after
mm ya ya
ya ya
that's why so
like what's his reason like
to go out
you never ask ah
oh my god okay
so right okay
ya okay so
okay err when I started um
maybe
ya last two weeks
okay okay so kan actually
ya okay so
err sarah said it's obvious lah and then I was like what do you mean it's obvious
then she said um most most of the time if you go out with your friends you will say the name
but then today you just said you going out then I was like huh
what's mama's problem lah what like why she keeps on calling us like
she said curfew at one so why are you like bothering us around twelve
dude like our curfew is at one
but then you act as it you are the err special child you know like
mm
like mix of both so like there's bad and good lah
like it's zeko's story but then how come zeko
told aisha then end up like mama know you know
huh okay then I was so pissed
so I went to expose one of aisha's secret lah
then after I exposed then after that err my mum was like
illegal gathering lah then I was like okay whatever
err mariam did you tell mama that
then she was like err mizi told me
so apparently she go text aisha eh she go text sarah she said
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
it's just zeko's ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
how to say ah like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
she
she go use my
like
I will throw your nike inside the water
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
err
huh
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
cause
I I won't say it's okay ah but
I don't know lah I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay lor but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm one then
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
no
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and aisha our shoe size is not that
like comfortable
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me

those kind of
ya

remember the last saturday
so after that
then I'm like
um
sue and the husband hey guys
then us being us always wanting to be in sue's car
okay let's go not us lah me actually
mmhmm I want
so now like got satay there got burger it's like
ah close when you want to go there you have to pass by
mmhmm
so it's like okay lah sure lah you have you have car right of course we can go
and then before you reach there after you pass by lim chu kang lah whatever shit
you have to turn in
so it's exactly like that except last time it was one way now it has become two way
but there is no light no nothing whatsoever
then as we turn right on our left side it is old estate
from there
ya it's empty
so so they mentioned that that place is uh for those fisherman
then I say I don't want I don't want fahmi go okay
and then you know I never say there and then but the stench oh my god is fucking smelly
the smell damn smelly it's damn bad
then we go
on the way there
on the left side
and there
I saw and then I was like
eh
then like that again at the corner of my eyes it's just like that again then okay
then I said eh no face eh
cover only eh
then I'm like oh okay then I think because I experience it in the car
and then with everyone
okay
okay I didn't see the face
it's not as scary because the the face is covered
ya
correct or if I saw it alone
then I would be like shit
so I just like uh okay
and fahmi was so nice to send everybody home you know means canberra woodlands and then my house kallang
and then we go back
so I scared
like how I want to answer my mother
my mother will scold me what
sia I don't know what to answer my mother siol
but you ever have like you know goosebumps
huh
ya it's like a figures more shadow
whoa
you got you know there is something there
what do you mean by dancing
siol ah
eh eh house
ah
ah
mm
oh
uh huh
uh huh
small sink
okay
mm
uh huh
uh huh
ah ah
mmhmm
mmhmm
it it was moving
like you see the arms and all
ah ah ah ah ah
dishes
ah
oh oh
but you know if you think properly
you are blocking them you know
then the way you shout is obvious that you saw one thing
no
uh
ah ah
oh
hello
mm
okay the master bedroom toilet okay
ah
correct correct
ah
hey
okay why is it right your first instinct is to turn to it not to not
turn away from it
I saw you first
train
wah until now
until time ah
no but like at that point in time ah
oh
whoa
wah so weird leh
anabelle
oh shit
that one dig out the eyes
mm
ah
ah ah ah
uh huh
at the side table lah
okay when you say that there's obviously something
one last ah one last
ah
wah irritating ah playing around
ah
ah ah ah
correct correct
whoa
wah
short eh
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task tau which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
don't
and then have you heard any in okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is lah but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
like you what me you what you want me to do like
but hundred bro
bro hundred is fucking real bro
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred is last time right tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
mm mm all the way down
ya so like the the part where
uh
ya like
ten O two
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
ya maybe so
with me
then there will be two of us correct
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say ah
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
uh you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so lasiri was sleeping
there is a scientific reason for all that what
then
when I say cannot ah will say no bro
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer what so she went to this one guy
hey bro
how you know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like eh maybe real siot
kan
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
uh ya same
and then they'll be like
hey
come ah fetch me at my place ah hey cheebye after you tell me all this you want me to fetch you at your workplace you okay or not okay
mm hoo
so ash wanted to tell us something about it
because
she started working there
we didn't want me to start
no the thing is no no the thing is like people who work there for years already must have told me everything
got so many things to say meh
oh
ya lah but then it's not from experience already mah
it's a pass it down
ya
ya the one at club ah like our our place she you already had gone ahead then confirm

you always have to go to level nine
I will go down to level nine go into the main changing room to check everything okay in the dark then go to I apple mac check because I lazy right go rate it that's it okay then I will go to the counter and on the light
okay now open the shutters late the wasted at the counter on music
okay auntie come okay then I check

nurul also just always scare me all this shit what
ya

oh I found I found a place okay everything in there is halal
kallang way
so they have like korean they have everything japanese
and they follow okay two veggie one
meat three dollar eighty cent
cheap right they really follow the economy style
downside is it only accept cash
ya
uh then ah old chang kee accept paywave
ah
I think what
cause
got waffle also then I just feel like I want to
no lah
how the heck are they going to fry the waffle
wow
wow like the double down something like that
mm not bad
waffle is swensen no no the thing is I cannot with swensen
the food is not great the service is low
I cannot ah swensen is just so meh
I would rather
you put me at pizza hut
rather than swensen
choices ya
oh
then got kid's meal meal then there's also the
oh
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit
uh uh
the bread is the sourdough
uh it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
uh uh
uh pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
I don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like I have to eat spicy food right
and always because when I go out right I feel very very very hungry I can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down I will end up burning my tongue
wah means you reach work swee swee sia
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know lah every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace ah that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
oh then you can walk
you quite smart hor
I've never thought of that leh
wow
shit
okay

a'ah
a'ah
um
um ya
ya uh um ya so
ya
wait wait wait
err
ya so they will say I wil tell you the number one nine seven two ah fifteen minutes later I I fill the number and tell me again then writing again right ya
ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do ah the
err what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is um they having dementia lah but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
the project
you know they don't
you better but there's no need to stop
we
know
so people
that version
you can got you involved
if means that you need to do
want to
we we talk
we
um
kid
ya I know
you know
mm
I
ya but
you are already tired from work then you go home your parents not to say burden but you have to give hundred percent dedication
um
oh
but sometimes
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive lah because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing um
ah
ya
the mmhmm
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
ya
ya
ya
I think
but if you have um your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit eh two hundred unit so two hundred units
but because her dad like everybody has err I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya lah
mm ya
I think
mm ya mm
mm
mm
I'm not
that kind of thing then um then like then
a'ah
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
mm
oo
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
because
ah
mm
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient lah that I'm already at my house like that
ya so
mm
mm
mmhmm
you think you have
um next ah what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
a'ah
what I think
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
so you like you're drowning you
I try to swim okay let me ah see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
ah swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
mm
it's like um
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the um for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
mm
mm mm
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy lah like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
ah
mm
mm so we know lah that communication is like the key to
mm
mm
mm
mm
phenomenon

towards the tracks
oh ya ya ya
but what's the difference seh
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that one is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name mah it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know ah
but
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom ah it's just like
no no no it's not at afghan there it's at

cajun cajun eh cajun cajun chicken ah
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice ah the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken ah
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya

you know some of the hawker centre ah
the western shop got like secondary school feels ah
Idah's Kitchen
I don't remember sia
is it the one the the thai shop take over ah
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall

I that one I thought that one is korean food what
oh I don't think I ate there before ah

that kind of price ah
uh the
the whole range ah like you know chicken chop uh
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff ah
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it ah
usually they give like half bowl like that right

japanese shop kan
eh
how lah I want to get better at DOTA sia
no eh but I play
it's like
if I get toxic opponent eh like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good ah
maybe ah maybe also
but I don't know ah
I don't know eh like
like
the genshin impact also cannot right
but okay ah nevermind ah because genshin like you can't really play with friends ah like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode ah
then you just explore the world yourself ah
then
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore ah
like the call it resin
so
you know ah so like uh this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge ah like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by lor then it recharge slowly
so it's mostly a waiting game ah like you finish
I don't know sia I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
like like really the game play is
fantastic ah phenomenal
but
I would say ah M I've play ah so far
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
ya so it's more of a waiting game ah so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term ah
ya true ah
oh
they spent like
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
I think maple ah cause this one is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already ah
like I I complete all the story mode already
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that ah
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already ah like
ya some more it's like
like
an advantage is advantage ah but like they make it minimal lor
since when I even watch soccer
I don't know ah like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word eh the
the attractiveness of watching soccer ah like it's just
so slow
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
you wait pass pass pass I don't know ah maybe just not my thing ah I guess
eh
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school ah
wanted to book ah
mm
I really not sure sia
I think the same week ah on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks ah
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
eh I do tomorrow already
it
eh I think they blacklist me already
where you where you uh where you plan on getting
APOL
uh huh I only know I only know Secret Lab ah
but then the pricing eh similar ah
like
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself what like it's not genuine leather right
ah
uh five hundred dollars on a chair
uh huh
huh
worth it ah got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site what
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this one must ask ah I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it ah
every other week
oh really ah
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
like
F&N pe F&N is like the standard ah the mm
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that eh uh basket
not basket ah they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
ya different
syrup also not a big fan ah
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established ah
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons uh uh the ice lemon tea is the blue colour one but they got the
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea ah but the blue colour one is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness ah ya the sugar
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
for for a while already ah
eh a'ah eh uh
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job ah dude
haven't ah but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know ah I just scared
like history repeat repeat itself ah
uh ya that's why
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much ah
so maybe not that bad ah
ya but like
in the one that pays well ah
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet ah
okay ah honestly ah
that time you work what no meh
ah
uh
oh
sheikh also work kitchen ah
oh
the one a
eh but that one also see your manager also ah
because
it's not really banquet ah but they set up for the banquet people ah
shang Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
I think so like who
oh yeah yeah yeah but
ah ya then this one is only for
like wedding reception only ah
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager ah so
the manager is like sheikh and that one also
uh like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay lah
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much ah
ya
ya
then I don't know ah I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends eh
uh
maybe
eh have you have you went to Fika before
ya eh the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is eh actually working title closed already it's beside working title ah
huh they work there
I cannot imagine rian at Fika though cause the people there are like really
how to say ah I don't know ah I can't imagine rian there
like aidil aidil I still can see him ah working at Fika but rian a bit hard ah to imagine him working there
eh but the food there the food
the eh the ambiance all
top notch ah
like work there also I think swee
eh the food
oh I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause uh my friend tell me their service there is like top notch ah
but then my friend say ah like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get ah
worth it lah ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend ah
oh
ah ya
I want to try ah but like
where is it ah I never knew where it was eh
but it's at bugis also
but then mm
but then the price ah start dating
ugh you scared what must pay for her ah
this
sad face
uh I thought you say you got beef with akshay
eh got beef with both the boyfriend and the girlfriend ah
uh beef is on
eh ya lah I think I want to watch
ugh
cause
no cause it's not a proper show it's like
mm ugh uh
uh no no no okay
but their storyline is all connected I think that's what The Real Bros is ah
ya uh key and peele established already ah
they got this new video ah what what was it eh uh
eh which one was it eh key and peele
it's the newer one to come out
uh
uh uh oh the jaden smith one
then you should uh uh you should watch it ah the jaden smith one funny
that time I watch with shah
car park ah
ah ya ya cause you were late ah
eh how you want to plan now or not meet with sundair
no ah
last month ah
don't say like that what makes you
ya
rehan why rehan
ha funny guy rehan
eh then how later later want to play DOTA
I play for a while ah
uh
I want to get better don't know
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress ah
valorant is not sia actually it's quite realistic what is like same as almost go but
only the suit like a bit
eh how
are you are you buying the five or not
oh
uh
ya like the first console I owned was
ugh cause okay
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing ah
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
ya so
then after that eh you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my
eh eh no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal lah like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three ah so like I never really believe them ah
uh wouldn't say well lah like
so so ah A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's okay ah above average ah slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know ah one day I just come home eh
then turns out one was for me ah one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted I wanted game boy what
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no ah but wasted ah cause my parents bought when it first came out
so it's one thousand
ah
ah ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my the slim one come out
ya
but then that the closest to console I got ah
ya but actually the games there quite good sia
ya
ah
I think take over ah the market
Vita Vita Vita ya ya ya
downfall lah ya
then I
but I
I think
ya it's like
ah that one is a Pokemon brand already ah
until now right ya Switch
got other games ah
ya don't know ah
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked ah don't know ah this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing ah
ya
the uh he got post on Twitter ah I got see a picture of his uh like office like that
I think
publicity ah like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that what
got a
probably that one also not he play ah maybe his team play for him ah
ya
hais
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice leh
like I okay this one is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular ah
adventurer concourse I forget ah
it is ah it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
uh medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself ah
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war is what ah
is it
oh no no no
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from lah
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget ah uh
I wah I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side ah
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
err uh quite cool ah
I forgot what's the name of the game ah
plazma burst
mm
isn't that just uh
escape room
and then there's a ghost chasing you
oh is it
I'm not sure ah
farid all ah
skipper
aiman
aiman
oh I don't know ah I never see ah they post on twitter ah
okay lah not bad lah he was top top in singapore ah one point of time
then your
for that hero will increase
ah so like uh he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again ah
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore ah
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands yishun ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's uh asian server ah
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in johor top in selangor top in sabah that kind of thing
ya that's why
singapore is one state ah singapore is a state what it's a state country right
uh
out outdate outdated information ah that one
okay I can say also lah
hais
mmhmm
how you know
of course lah
mm
the malay eh actually this one I can ask my friend lah you know khai
ah she very interested in like malay culture and all that lah so like
I do research on it also
on it but khai like he can tell me like
oh got this guy
he travel with uh columbus
around the world
so ah he say it's a malay it's a malay guy ah that travelled with columbus to find out that the world is round
ya
he research about all these ah
um
like um got
uh
how to say eh
in power ah
like they
uh
then they defend all themselves
quite cool ah when you
when you hear the story
haig road
steak
eh
burger got another YouTuber ah I forgot what's his name ah sam the burger guy ah something like that
that one also he makes swee ah like proper american burger
not so fat ah like around guga size also
but he a bit redneck vibes ah
ah I don't remember he wear specs ah
uh huh
so like if you
that one I not sure maybe now cause he quite big already kan maybe he can get sponsors ah but at the start I'm pretty sure I think he buy himself ah
like you know it's like he just very passionate about cooking
from japan all like you see there's
the knife all very nice and very sharp
I got see knife restoration lah
eh but keep samurai sword like cool ah in singapore
is it illegal eh
you got watch the uh eh I think crimewatch eh
it shows like this indian guy ah he turn over a new leaf
ah king something kind david king eh
george king eh I think his name george king

so fathul I have a question for you mm if you have three wishes what are err what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would err void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say um by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things hmm maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants lah
mm and some skills that I want to have err maybe include err having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world ah
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily err to us to some people to live happily is to have err the money and the wealth
err so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy ah and intelligence also ah this is to me I think it relates to me also ah because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
uh so maybe for now we move uh to the next question which is err superpowers fathul what err if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
ah eh
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of ah the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you err by accident
the the
the amount of err infection or the possibilities of uh infection rate ah you have anything to argue
yes correct
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk uh ambitions that I have
or maybe uh I I can take risks without having worrying that I might uh injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe err get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win ah
provided I am strong ah and maybe with this regeneration
hmm
I can donate let's say some parts of my uh limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
hmm where I have this ability so I can do is err I request my leg to be cut off and then give away err in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard uh tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
mm what do you think about this regeneration ability
mm it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having uh to be looked at or without err being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
hmm I have this
I want to be uh isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self ah to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems uh affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
mm
how long maybe until I feel peace ah so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months ah but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months ah then slowly maybe I will
err increase the number of the period ah slowly
hmm
we can never do something to improve the people around us
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable lah
but it has to be looked in a certain way ah whereby the person
err
he is not affecting badly uh around the people uh uh he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state ah
uh
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
they will change a lot lah so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small err goals small err
small achievement so this child will live without uh having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife ah he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife err agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free ah to do anything that he wants
do you think so
eh
uh cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
err
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary ah but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams ah
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart ah
mm so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self err I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self ah
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
mm and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
um what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos uh I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and uh an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud lah or maybe just email yourself ah so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
err a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself uh since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is err I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see err how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe err start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
mm
K
you maybe you next we should talk about um near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was err I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was uh stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall uh is when I was
err riding bike uh it happens maybe due to
err rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to uh overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next uh topic that I have in mind which is err a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
uh ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
hmm whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that err there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
um synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example uh few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
err I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future um a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go uh deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took uh I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
so you have anything to add on

oka
uh getting ready to cla

words mmhmm
mm
doing mmhmm
but I feel like singapore these kind of things is not very exposed like media things going on so like a bit hard lah for you right
mm mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm understand understand
full time jobs and then as you were saying regarding like not what you want but more to survival yes
ya take whatever there is mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
culinary
mm
ya that's true
mm mm mm
uh huh
ya it's true mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
ah but from this situation also like a lot of thing was affected like we can't even like travel anymore or like go to concerts and stuff like that and I don't even know when will we
fun things like what
mm ya
mm oh ya all these are all affected
mm
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
mm
mm mm mm
but also depends on each person lah because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that one can affect us like a lot
err yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
ya
mm
mm
like I feel I feel like as we age ah and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm ya I understand
mm hmm mm
mm mm mm
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way lah but it's just slow
mm mm mm oh my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
mm
mm our blessings
mm mm mm ya
ya ya ya
mm mm mm
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right mm mm mm
a change lah
progress
mm mm mm
mm
close minded lah
mm mm mm
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue ah about all these matters but then come to come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional lah due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that one is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
mm mm
thinking
mm
mm
mm mm mm ya
mm mm
mm mm mm
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that one actually like kind of assured me
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm
what
ah flaws
uh huh
you know what same girl
bedok ah ah
actually I never try before
mm
mm
mm
mm
I've been wanting to try that though I've always seen people post like this online
what do they sell though western is it
mm
ah I'm craving for pasta now
mindset
you started it
ya we have to eat
okay lah porridge I had a breakfast I mean to me I like ah but I think
I mean not really I mean um I think my taste buds more of the older people kind of kind of taste buds ah but
I mean I'm not really a porridge eater but this porridge is not bad ah
kind of one of the top one I mean not top but one of the good ones
mm it's been long is it
but I thought you work early one you don't have time to get this meh
wait so when you work you start at eight correct
ten minutes for the whole shift
eight to five right
uh huh
mm oh
you should have girl
oh that's true
you're not a morning person
mcgriddle oh ya oh you like that
ah it's not a fixed menu ah
I don't know to make people want it lah
to me personally I feel like it's too heavy eh for my liking
huh you eat light you will not heavy
wrong with you ah
ah
huh that's so god damn weird
ya ya the egg and the cheese is there cheese in it
oof god damn stop it girl we hungry
oh I don't know that one I'm not sure
anyway tell me about yourself like like how you from
from secondary school from primary school until poly like we met in poly correct
we met in poly and then I mean I didn't think we had a chance to get to know each other also
like we mostly met for like
ya for our tasks and things to do not at our own timing so like I think we can take this chance to like you know
anywhere you can start ah anywhere you can recall
wah sis you know my my memory sucks lah so
I don't know girl anywhere
mm
oh
ya so I announced it go you know okay ya such as
so how many years of floorball did you play
four years oh from sec one eh
wow
wow
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
how
mm
oh my god
mm I know I know I know
I keep it out they are used
mmhmm
oh my god
ah
ah
did it actually work
so what you bring it for your practices ah
uh huh
then
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
mm
mm
mm
mm
but in school you use the school stick ah
but for competitions do they provide sticks or
oh so in the end you still bought lah
class fund
oh eh ah
edusave eh
ah
mm mm mm mm mm
mm
so you prioritise the uh
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm mm
mm
so your for your school floorball was it an all girls or mixed
oh there's two floorball teams
mm
mm
oh so you improved a lot ah
mm mm mm mm
mm
mm
why though
looking be scared probably isn't it
ah
mm
mm
did they like dislike you
hatred ah oh acceptance from that
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
mm
to join you lah
mm mm mm
for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things lah like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas ah
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you ah so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay lah so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it what
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
mm
the floorball is it
mm
mm
mm
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
mm
mm mm mm
get through with it
uh huh ah ah ah ah
mm
mm
mm
oh so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh math was the only one you failed
but
oh okay
mm mm mm mm mm
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear sia
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
mm
mm mm mm mm
oh okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it lah if not it's like really tiring for you
mm
mm mm mm
mm
mm
oh floorball
that is going to affect your grade more sia
exams
oh my god O-level
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a um
really
mm
mm
mm
really
mm
mm
mm
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before lah in singapore ah like a popular way
weird why
mm
mm mm
mm mm mm
mm
ah oh ya
oh ya we had the camp
huh
really
vibes ah
mm mm
but I think we achieved quite
a lot lah from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember sia
mm ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head ah but I think executing part ah
that one is not for me ah
that's true
mm
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw lah
why ah
oh oh why though ah
why ah
oh ah ya ya ya
ya sia haiya
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm
tertiary is what secondary ah
oh primary secondary or poly ah
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school I was like really young so I didn't have any like
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was aite but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me lah
so I would choose the primary school lah cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from ahmad ibrahim at yishun
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in ahmad ibrahim for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that uh I moved to serangoon so I had to transfer myself so I went to pei hwa at sengkang
so that was when I had like
so eh no pei hwa was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at sengkang
so that was where oh wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at ahmad ibrahim right I joined
err skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there ah and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that one and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport lah
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping eh so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow lah
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper ah that one
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went ah
ah I think so
I think so but I really forget sia I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that err okay that's all then my primary school was
err skipping lah then after that I went to anchorgreen sengkang
and then that's at sengkang and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
ah
ah no we have three types of dances all
ah we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing lah so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones one I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
ah ya lah those lah ya just for fun
really
from what like
just like interest uh huh
personally I feel free styling is like
hard sia for me
mm mm
because it's up to you also what right ya
okay
ah
err for me I don't know eh I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand eh this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
ah
uh I think I don't know ah I mean if like one person do on her own ah I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people that kind then it's okay ah
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban lah like
I don't understand the nice to it lah hip hop that's like that's like nice ah I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
oh I even joined a kayaking uh competition
and ya in
polys ah I mean organised it
but it was secondary school err but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite err like an achievement for us ah
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our
like you know it's not our kayaking it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that err then we got
kayaking and stuff oh there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
is normally with
so sometimes when do things we'll also do things ah like those like
err camps and shit and stuff is normally with eh so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay lah cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
err secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very good
teachers ah I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like meh so I don't
ya so I didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
oh ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course lah
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful lah the the environment the the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but meh not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school lah
poly like not really eh maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me lah ya
mm actually I did ah but I feel like my
I feel like my not good enough
mm there's no design meh
mm
mm mm
wow okay mm okay okay okay okay
I didn't know uh uh media is like so enhanced like so many things
mm mm mm mm
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
mm
oh like you the posters and stuff lah
ah
oh oh cool cool cool
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
is up to you
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm mm mm
mm mm
mm
then you should like work for like those mm shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing what no meh
mm
mm mm
mm mm then you should open a YouTube channel
why
mm mm
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
mm mm mm mm
ya I also just realised that sia
culinary was really just because of the coffee part lah really
actually ah if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know eh honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my I design the poster also right
I don't know sia
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places lah hor
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide ah
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now ah they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
mm mm
mm
mm ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says eh like err experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like uh signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the the uni one honestly
so I don't know lah so I don't when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
wow
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like err capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm ya that's true
ya
and it's sad
ya
ya life in a nutshell or what it's so sad
mm
mm
mm mm mm
ya like people cannot see you enjoy things
I mean like there's always bound to have someone who will be unhappy with your achievements
and stuff like that so ya
ya
ya huh
mm
mm mm
mm ya
mm mm mm
mm
mm
but I think that's what makes up a person ah a person will not have only good sides in him there are bound to have ugly sides in a person also
but then just some people has more ugly sides than good sides in them
mm mm
ah we just don't know what happen behind closed doors
that's true

hello
yes
okay
so
hais
there goes our effort early
anyway
just
find something new then
okay lah
no lah as in for a staycation it's a nice place actually
although
not much that you can do in that bugis area

sim lim square

the mall that replaced funan

how can you turn an mall into a sports ah ugh I have no words for this
velocity
eh no I am just kid
oh is it is it that's why
ya you're not you're not supposed to fly like five or ten kilometers away from either these two places

but which which hotel is it that's the problem you don't remember right

difference between SGAG and mothership

sian but bo pian lah
ah
I think you kena cancelled lah you
everything all don't want everything all like err
no no no head no tail so
well I guess also um I I think um
I think ah err
the age is also catching up
so um before I think like um
uh you can you can apply any job you want but
I I don't know I don't know whether err if this is
true to everyone ah but I think
err cause I ever applied like um just some jobs
you know like err
just out of curiosity
I don't think
err reply me at all I don't know what went wrong ah probably
err
my my resume is err nonsense
err you know or or it's just that
my experience are no experience at all
but err then I I found out again like probably it's
the age is also catching up ah
so
ya probably that
ya but I mean err
don't
don't don't let down lah you know I mean don't
don't
don't uh what
ya lah don't give up lah just
send lah you know
you send I mean ah for me I'm not sending like one thousand
err resume out but before like
whenever I send you know like
three four
maybe one or two will come back ah but
nowadays like even if you send about fifteen
none of that like come back so
ya lah err zul um
with all these things that happened
you wish you can
but you but you have the experience sial
you have the experience why why you why you scared
why you scared about all that that that you know like
I think just err
chin up put your chin up and and um
ya look on the brighter side lah you know because
they can be young
but
you ate the chilli first so ya
ya
ah
really meh
anyhow
eh ah zul
ah because there are some people who don't
um
mm
it's actually err
dia memang leceh tapi persoalannya is
you don't feel good about it so
ah
mm
mm
so
ah
and
and what will be another twenty
laid back
more chillax
chillax
ya
what if it's really really apocalypse ah
nonsense kan
ya kan
ya circuit breaker
like I think we were talking about circuit breaker itself
phase one was later on
ah
okay ah err
spending sia
big land to
to play around to to run around
ah
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
ah
till it go into phase one
and then yes
um lively ah
ah
ah
but ya
but I think during err
wow
err
ah
ya
ya
I think it's okay if we are younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have um
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then um
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown ah and then ya
perspective you can be
right I mean
but we we are alright with that we've we've
we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
the effects are there lah you know
err I don't think
kan
more of err like going through a war
not not like before this you know
constantly err doing things
be it err
err
you know all being um
stopped I would say that
ya
or or or the environment
of going through eh err things um
ah the things that we do
is err not doing very well right
they had an industry and the thing is
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
ugh
ya ya ya all the big err bars club
um
chill a little bit and them um
see what's going on and then from there
err
come to a point whether
and what not
time um everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
uh for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not um
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
um
it was haywire napster coming in you know
ah it was for for for consumer they will like it ah
but people who produce it people who
who you know
mm you know big err movie affected by
whack or or or
or just like um be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya I mean
there will be light there will be light
um
apart from that probably um
share it because ya

ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
ah ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
okay ah I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use ah
like you can't really copyright that shit
eh fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
err ya I think that's different
mm fair
oo ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad sia
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already sia considering like
okay lah okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
ah uh huh
err it's like five in india
somebody copy eh copyrighted ah ya copyrighted ah
somebody copyrighted five so
five they Sony can't release five as five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably ah I think
probably will try to buy it off the person ah
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
one two three four
ah ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
oh four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya lah you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create ah create ah you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay ah it was rocky ah
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better ah
I mean it's just a brand name only ah at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like oo look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive ah but then it's like
eh ah no I'm not about that life man
man
no ah not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya lah I mean it is a gaming peripheral ah but still like
at least limit it ah like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like oh Razer
and then it you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that one by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
eh that kind
ah
with my current night shift
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this one is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like oh my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay lah like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the one that you are looking at this the second one
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit lah like
whoever ah whoever say something right then err or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job ah and then like cannot ah
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring siol
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya lah no lah leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
uh I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can ah but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay ah depends on the company lah but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense ah but
the travel expense though it's free
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right ah I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance ah you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything ah
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can ah
let anyone use the thing
sial ah I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me ah
no lah it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like eh there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like err if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
uh all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras ah
like I'm just saying there's
there's uh
hidden thing to it lah like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply ah
no ah
like where the hell am I supposed to go sia if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can ah can is can ah like the
I mean the
no ah
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the no you eat there in the oops room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
uh I mean it's true ah I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that one then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before lah but
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this ah job
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like sial ah where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
uh ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is ah but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days a few days ago also
ah zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya lah
eh no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
is
fourteen days siol I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
okay ah not really okay ah
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that lah like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what uh
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
uh I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay ah
eh but then new zealand that time got uh recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
mmhmm
mmhmm
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive ah
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see lah what happened now
three hundred thousand already
uh huh
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see eh go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
ah that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like sial ah
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit sia like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
oo
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest what so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya lah I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only ah I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything ah
ya
okay
really
uh huh
oh is it
ya borat is borat lah so
I wonder if they edited that out
uh huh
I mean to be okay ah no ah
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is ah but you know it's fucking video proof ah like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
uh they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know lah which state ah one of the judge lah they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is ah
ah
no comments no comments
in
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for taiwan soon
I think world war three should start soon
err china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to taiwan right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit taiwan ah
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
eh ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
taiwan is part of china and then
I mean ya lah like
and they could have just let taiwan

one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
oh speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay ah it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
kan I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
ah
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that lah but okay ah there are the backwater parts ah
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
sial ah
uh huh
it's basic human nature lah what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you eh
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya lah
okay
uh huh
okay
wow
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions ah
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is ah it's his style
either way it eh no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe eh
we might as well be
kim jong un
oh my god I don't know ah sia
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
and that that is trump in a nutshell lah eh
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing oh I do uh money money money lagging
oh wow
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care ah
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the period
that one terrible siol like
only essential workers what
me ah
then like yours truly ah
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
they got
it's not even that much sia
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like sial ah they can sial ah that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during period sial ah how to earn fifty sia
okay ah not not everyone can ah but that's why that's why during I had the same driver a week straight sia
he live somewhere ah there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book eh same guy tomorrow eh same guy
and like okay ah ten minutes only what not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
like unless on that day I overslept or something
rare ah but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no ah
it was at boon lay
don't know call call message
everything no reply
siol then I like what the fuck sial wait here half an hour already siol then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing sia cancel
no ah
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already sia
kan
just cancel get a new one
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
uh
okay lah ya there's there's the more apt way to say it lah
you collect the food already
then you put delivered
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
oh ya ya ya ya
ya
or those people in I mean the disabled people
hmm
ah
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift what
like rare you find
that that one is dorms
eh well
service industry lah eh
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit ah you get that kind of shit ah
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it ah
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night ah
cause
mm
ah
okay lah I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
there's only one entrance and one exit lah so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell ah got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come
ha right
then provided you got exact change
I'm helping do your job
but ya I mean that that period ah
the the one that people were all in panic
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you eh not the six hundred no
one point five litre
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
ah
like okay ah if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand ah but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like eh siala
this thing ah like that like that like that
then like
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more

uh huh
ah yes correct correct
mmhmm
ya
how how does how does it work
in the new uh version
okay
mm mm
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice ah there's no uh you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can err
do according to your preferences ah
ah okay so there's no like
four four two
mm
mm
so in order for me to play
for example tiki-taka I cannot have a
uh anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my uh my formation is flick enough for the tiki-taka or
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference ah like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what lah
so for the
players also
mm
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and uh
mm
mmhmm
okay
ah okay okay okay so
they have their own uh attitude lah and uh they have their own attitude when facing the
ah each games ah
mm
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right denmark is it
ah
if I'm not wrong eh uh the last
that's that's long sia
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year sia last year or last two years
so I eh correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be ah fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing twenty you think twenty one coming soon or not
oh the the twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
ah ya
oh I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out ah so if okay if I am going to download it
ah
okay
Acer uh you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that one I think I quite lost already
ah K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
okay lah so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
ah okay
okay
F sixteen and twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
ah
ya I know I know I know
mmhmm
mm
mm mm
I have ah eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth ah
I don't want jagged jagged uh you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
ah
ah
ya hopefully
but wasted the twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also uh got twenty touch
ah
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
a'ah
that's a
that's stressful
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people ah cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror ah kan but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
ah
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say ronaldo cristiano ronaldo
okay from juventus to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
ah okay
ah
okay
mm
ah okay okay okay
okay
so okay ah dortmund sancho is the english guy is it okay okay
mm
let's say let's say
this sancho is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
ah
mmhmm
mm
okay
okay
this social group is
very important lah actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
mm
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games ah
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
ah
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
port for it
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than sixteen
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know lah I I
ah
I I mean I I know about the the the
mm
ah
ah ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
mm
it is intensive ah okay but anyway
okay ah maybe after this then I will give it a try ah
okay lah we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
look left look right
look look see see lah that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
mm
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
mm
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the ah twenty is very realistic every every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
ah so
so imagine actually imagine
twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
eh eh how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have sia god damn it four more days okay ah nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine lah maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
prime minister lee hsien loong announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like haris harun still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
ah
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians pe is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
mm
ah I mean
ah
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible pe
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
a'ah
okay
okay
mm
so okay ah
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see ah
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see eh when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing ah
mm
mmhmm
mm
mm
mm
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
mm
I mean you can ask juventus how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that one is their what italian one is it
oh okay
okay
mm
mmhmm
oh that's so
wah
ya correct
mmhmm
ah yes yes
mm mm
ah okay I mean
well that's
err when they are from the group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
cause there were
mm mm
there is know the
even below north south
time for them to just you know what
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole ah
ah
ah
ah that's why
ya
ya but
day
I mean technically if everyday
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
err physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger ah
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger ah I'm the privileged one as compared to
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
year one year two
CISCO CISCO oh that's almost seven years
ah
six seven six seven years I never play
oh anyway if you want to know ah five aside
ah
ah
ah
ah
I mean that's a good idea ah
I mean true
you want to be
ah
mm
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently lah uh after army
I don't catch up already cause know
people watch football at three I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say eh
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true ah
to ah
well I mean
like what
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
mm
if you notice
eh he cannot speak tamil pe
then he shouldn't
mm
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
mmhmm
uh huh
nobody dubbed over him kan
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say vanakam for thirty times ah for for thirty minutes pe I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
english
of course ah
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see ah my my
grandfather my
basically all the old people ah
all the our not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me lah so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
ah the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
mmhmm
okay
a'ah
mm
a'ah
mm
mm
ah
mm mm
okay
okay
ya correct
mm
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this uh
not say rider ah this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
and then and he and she asked me in english about I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from johor to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who um who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
mandarin or tamil lah if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent ah and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right wah this is very confusing ah
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true pe
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish ah no sia
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
but
I suspect
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
mm
so how
a'ah
mm
okay
you you agree pe okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say lah how
ah
ya that's why
ah
mm mm mm
mm
mm mm
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
remind each other about know how your going and calling each other brother in italian pe
okay but you you understand what I trying to say pe
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
mm
ya
I mean ah there there is a I think there's a occasion pe there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
yet he's always interrupting us oh by the way ah
mm
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
err right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
mm
ah
okay okay
ah coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
that one for what eh
okay
okay
okay
mm
ah ah ah
ah that is quite long tau
ya actually a lot of things changed ah
but it's nice
ah ya lah
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot lah I mean it's so so constricted lah this place to be honest
uh twenty twenty four seven
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a ah there is a schedule
ah
ah now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september pe you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already tau
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
mmhmm
there is a
ya
yes
I mean I tried to warn you
I mean ya I know I understand how you feel to to to to be squeezed
just for maintenance ah
mm
ya I know I know
I mean
wow that sucks
mm
ya ya
I mean just like that eh
err
a a billion dollar company multi billion dollar company just
gone sia
but
I mean oil should be cheaper right or
it already
keep it up
picking up already
ah
mm
I mean ya lah ya lah there
will go back
to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything lah but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
ah
ah ya
okay
ah
now that's a very interesting concept
ah
ah ah
mm mm
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the are trying to think ah but
but uh I mean if we see uh
technically if the government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our ah and
ah
so maybe we can raise up to our and ask our government to release us from this
mask thing I mean
we got safe entry pe
the the thing is does it work though

hi husna
mm
okay so um our marriage uh now is five years already yes okay so you're talking about uh the starting point or just current
mm
mm okay
mm
what okay
planning
okay
oh
okay
now it's D already disaster damage
devolution done uh last one is done lah
okay if let's say right for me ah if I plan eh sometimes it doesn't work
that way so it's very disappointing ah better don't plan just go you say like you will say uh if you plan plan plan but sometime never go to your plan because you are you are you are doing with two person you know
me and my wife if
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle lah
ah that is for me
so in between like what's happening you have to be have own trust lah each other have their own trust
then just go mmhmm
okay
ah
okay I guess correct ya
hmm
okay
mmhmm
okay
mmhmm
in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he no ya but I think for planning something hasty leave it up to me correct like for example when we went to get the house you shouldn't at decision that for example we want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married ah yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
okay
mmhmm
decision lah ya
ha yes correct that that that's on my wife correct
mm
plan first lah that's
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh ya that was was okay I remember you want me to say about it
that was that one was at uh segamat eh segamat eh segamat malaysia so sorry ah I have to say that
um very straightforward what you want the colour
the wording
and the address already in detail and just let them design it you know what happen on that time
it's like they asking a lot of question like uh
this one uh did how to say eh they did ask a lot of question about the design we said this one want to be very simple we we we're not like fussy you know I was very simple we give them a sample already but they still do the wrong things eh
malay to malay you know I don't know how what language I want to say also not sure so this is the funny part but the funny is only one time you know lah the the next time ah I mean the next round I mean the next uh I ask them to redo again then the face change you know
