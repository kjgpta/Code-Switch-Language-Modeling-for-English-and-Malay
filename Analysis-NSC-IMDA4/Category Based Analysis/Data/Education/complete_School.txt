<malay>akak kakak</malay> last <malay>kerja kat mana</malay>
<malay>kakak kerja apa kat situ</malay>
<malay>penat tak kerja situ</malay>
okay <malay>kak</malay> okay <malay>kalau kalau kerja kat situ</malay> [kan] <malay>apa yang akak pelajari</malay>
<malay>ada ada apa kak kerja kak ada pekerja yang susahkan benda tak</malay>
<malay>sambil kakak kerja kat kilang itu kakak ada pernah buat kesilapan apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>daripada</malay> incident <malay>tu</malay>
okay <malay>kakak sekarang mempunyai</malay> (um) experience experience <malay>di dalam bahagian industri</malay> baking (um) <malay>kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba</malay> industry <malay>yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba</malay>
<malay>apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar</malay> (uh) <malay>kanak-kanak yang kecil</malay>
<malay>kira kakak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak</malay> have the skills <malay>untuk</malay> cope with this problem
<malay>dengan adanya</malay> technologies <malay>sebagai telefon bimbit dan</malay> tablet <malay>adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita</malay> around ten years old <malay>ke</malay> eight years old <malay>gitu bila tak ada komputer semua</malay> or <malay>bila takde</malay> handphone <malay>kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita</malay> time <malay>kecil</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak dulu beza</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab dulu kita takde</malay> netflix <malay>takde</malay> youtube <malay>kita cuma tengok</malay> live and live <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> if you want to go to the toilet <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> advertisement
then remember last time you have to <malay>apa nak kena</malay> rush the toilet <malay>kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat</malay>
<malay>sekarang senang</malay> [jer] now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it [kan] like how did we survive last time like <malay>kalau</malay> you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit <malay>susah tapi</malay> like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
like there's only one computer in the house then <malay>kalau</malay> if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days [ah] like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and (err) the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so <malay>kakak</malay> remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
so given that nowadays phones they (uh) they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me [ah] I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about [oh] no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about #johor# do you remember going to #johor#
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old #johor# house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old #johor# house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way <malay>macam</malay>
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
(mmhmm) now the closest to #johor# we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there [ah]
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at (uh) #pulau ubin# what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so (um) what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to #bugis# like literally a five minute walk to #bugis# if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at <malay>rumah lama</malay> that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to #bintan#
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said [oh] we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like [ah] we're choosing to go to hong-kong [oh] why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so
talk to you another time relay ya [oh] what time you know
it's a colleague so ya

so I
[oh] still got school holiday [meh]
[oh] I okay
but I just check the price first just now you say Pan Pacific right

[oh] that [one] that [one] we haven't plan yet
but knowing #angah# I think he wants to eat
malay food like <malay>nasi</malay>
!aww! this [one] is nice
but I think because of the adults <malay>itu</malay> [lah] I think ya
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel [eh]
because the Amara hotel what what my (uh) what I
thought that I
(err) should do right
is I will take two separate room
and then one room is me <malay>kak</malay> #ain# #aryan# and
my younger brother and then another room is for my parents [lah] so they can <malay>apa ni</malay>
at least they can spend the night together
since it's his <malay>hari jadi</malay> also my father
there
<malay>lagi lagi dia</malay> half price [seh] of the Pan Pacific <malay>tapi</malay> like okay [lah] like like we cannot be together in one room [lah]
[oh] they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay [lah]
let's see the photos
but I know they <malay>baru</malay> recently just renovated [tau]
Amara
!huh! got no plate
Maggi
you know like some hotel <malay>macam</malay> they the shower and everything is in the bathtub right but I don't want that but but I know Amara is not like that
because like how [mah] want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay [lah] #ilham# can sleep outside
ya
this [one] [oh] okay [dah] I think this is the [one] that I wanted to take
[eh] no <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay <malay>ni</malay>
#angah# don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
<malay>dia tak suka</malay>
like <malay>dia kata</malay> like very boring [seh]
okay this one is for three adults right
so I was thinking that okay [lah] either way [lah] like if (uh) <malay>adik</malay> want to if my younger want to sleep with
(uh) <malay>ayah</malay> and #ma# then go ahead
they can sleep
on the floor [lah] of course [lah] with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that [lah] as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I think I will I really think I will <malay>bangun pagi</malay> if
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
the artscience museum <malay>yang dekat</malay> <malay>tak</malay>
is it
(mm)
(mm)

actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus

ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right

I think he will also like I think he will also like (um) <malay>apa tu lagi satu tu</malay>
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward [lah] but I think he
I think he don't mind
need to <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
no [eh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why [ah] why you don't like it
[oh] is it
what did you have
a a what
[oh]
(mm) okay [lah] I will decide
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm)
<malay>mana</malay> notes [ah]
I also have it every month
(err) <malay>abeh</malay> (um) okay [lah] I will decide
on the itinerary
ya <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> (um)
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that (um) indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
you know what you mean I I I I thought like <malay>macam</malay> the culture is
is like a bit weird [lah] so when I taste it [eh] I thought that it's going to be bad but then like [oh] my god it's so nice
(err) I ate the prawn green curry you the #naan#
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we (uh) we
(mm) it's too loud (mm)
because we we passed by and then after that we thought [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] can [ah] like craving something local because like that is how many days already we are there
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay [lah]
and then I don't really like #udon#
that's why maybe I don't (mm)
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
when I taste it I was like [eh] <malay>sedap</malay> [seh] then like
(err) okay [lah] I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like (uh)
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar [tau] for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
#naan#
okay [lah] it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay !wow! I I I don't ever have
<malay>macam</malay> like this kind of food
<malay>bila dekat</malay> singapore
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
(mm) (mm) (mm)
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
(mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in #bali# remember the the Yoshinoya
the #yakiniku# beef
is it the same thing
[ah]
but then that one the one that I ate also called #yakiniku# beef why
[oh] wait
maybe maybe maybe
[oh] is it
(mm)
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose #mee soto#
[oh] okay
<malay>susah</malay> [eh]
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
I think it'll be my mum's (err) <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay>
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know [what]
because if I take that <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay> then can I can it be served <malay>dengan nasi</malay> or no if no <malay>nasi</malay> then I don't want it
because it need to be with <malay>nasi</malay> [lah] hot piping <malay>nasi</malay>
I think my I think my mum my mum's (err) <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi goreng daging</malay> is nice also
I mean if a dish that like got everything inside like protein and everything okay [lah] then the <malay>nasi goreng</malay> I think is a good choice
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
<malay>telur mata lembu</malay> on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like (um)
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it [lah]
of course right
but like <malay>macam</malay> like when you become her
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
[oh] but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity [ah] rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like [oh] my god [oh] my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the #wayi# can just like (err) can I
ya can I just like (err) take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
(err) helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like I really seriously <malay>tak tahu</malay> why they need like <malay>banyak banyak bilik</malay>
like <malay>bilik dorang banyak</malay> [tau] like
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room (uh) house is like seven million
(err) with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets (err) attached (uh) with (uh) indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
or <malay>macam main</malay> hide and seek <malay>ke</malay>
scary [siol]
I don't think I can
don't [ah]
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
(ugh)
(mmhmm)
and then they put there as a meme
okay [oh] ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
<malay>dekat dalam</malay> flat like (err)
buy one get one free
[oh] you mean like okay okay I don't know
(hmm)
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
[ah] okay then that kind of deal like okay [lah] [meh] I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay [lah] maybe that one is a bit worse
like !huh! one for one
but I don't get to choose
ya but <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam</malay> let's say they
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
ya okay that one is already (um) <malay>macam</malay>
standard [lah]
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body [ah]
[ha]
I think the face you look at it every day like <malay>hari hari tengok</malay>
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like (ugh)
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
or like <malay>tukar</malay> the face in like
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
[dah] <malay>sapau sapau muka macam</malay>
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like (uh)
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things [lah] maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
(err)
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients [eh] no no no (uh) like he or she is not wrong
[ah] no <malay>dia macam dia tak dia tak</malay> murder that person <malay>dia tak</malay> kill that person is it
and everything like that and then
[ah] I like like ya I like (uh) true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news [oh] I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are (um)
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
(uh) or like paranormal activity all these like
(um) (uh) cable (uh) ya
a good movie correct
ya they want to like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] this is we captured it for the camera
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
(err) ya ya ya
ya
(mm)
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what [ah]
[ah] chris watts [ah] is it the chris watts
the [one] that she the [one] that the the
ya the [one] that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
(um)
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can (uh) on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay [lah] maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix [one] [eh]
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
(uh) I mean he's a narcissist what (uh) eventually he will just gonna act that [oh] no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
like the fact that like he had (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err) he got a mistress
(err) (uh) okay it's a girlfriend <malay>yang</malay> he knows
about two months prior prior to the wedding [eh] prior to the murder sorry
ya like <malay>macam</malay>
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
<malay>dorang</malay> actually did include
(err) the girlfriend [lah] but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious [lah]
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like (um)
not <malay>kecil</malay> [lah] maybe when I was a teenager
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle [lah] like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like (uh) grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the [one] that
I had after I had
#aryan# after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
(uh) healthy okay [lah] healthy is subjective [lah]
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
love him [ah] like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>atuk nenek dia punya dia punya</malay>
especially to his <malay>atuk nenek</malay> [lah] because like
this
two people is the [one] <malay>yang apa ni</malay> bring you up
take care of you when you are young [kan] so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
return the favour [lah] I think he really need to <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [dah] <malay>besar</malay> he will need to realise [oh] [eh] actually I <malay>nak</malay>
I need to (err) <malay>jaga</malay> my <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> I need (uh) anything that
(err) they need I have to
do it
for them
[ah] and then my third wish actually
(uh) I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still (uh) I'm already pretty
[oh] I
(err) when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
and I know about it happen because <malay>kita kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
(err) (uh) (um) lower secondary
then I think
ya ya ya that that was what (uh) <malay>apa yang</malay> I mean [lah] like
I really think <malay>yang</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is like
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
I know right and then and then a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> nothing you know they like have a job and then the next time they don't have
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
<malay>macam</malay> like things happened just like that and there are a lot of people the most
thing the most like <malay>macam paling sedih</malay> that I've heard
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head [kan] I will actually really think like then I was like [eh] like quite sad [lah] like
they are somebody's
(err)
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know

november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
(err) actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation [lor]
no because you <malay>nak kena kerja dengan</malay> kids [kan]
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya [lah] I pass
so
you know that day I went for (uh) a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
at white lodge which is actually just here only <malay>kat</malay> west coast road
and white lodge is (um)
it's a private (uh) institution
ya it's a private (err) it's a private school [lah] it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's (uh) it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge (um)
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in [ah] okay like the the one I went I went (uh) from eight thirty to one
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I have to (um)
I have to (err) assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates [lah] but they are they are like
one teacher (err) to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
depending on the group so <malay>kat</malay> over there the the the smaller the the smallest is three years old
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then (um)
after that the okay so what I did was like (uh)
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
(um) I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children [lah] (um) okay the first half the eight thirty to
eleven twenty <malay>tu yang</malay> before the lunchtime <malay>[kan]</malay> I actually assisted the teachers
(um)
for kids that (uh) the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
that's what I'm amazed and <malay>dorang punya</malay> culture is very diverse because most is all
#ang moh#
and then mixed race like japanese and #ang moh#
like (um) japanese and japanese korean and (uh) sweden
like swedish sweden <malay>pula</malay> (um)
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] like
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local [one]
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international (uh) so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
[orh] ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
[ah] <malay>sakit kenapa sakit</malay> (hmm)
eight thirty to five [lah]
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because (uh) if you go under government
saturday you're (uh) open half day
then you need to alternate working [ah]
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this [one] like saturday sunday you are closed and then [what] I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
(uh) plus <malay>yang</malay> kid <malay>umur</malay>
three to six <malay>dengan</malay>
(err) five to [eh] sorry three to four <malay>dengan</malay> five five to six <malay>tu</malay>
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower [lah]
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see (uh) what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
because they are very like <malay>macam</malay>
colourful
colourful characters [lah] like
(err) and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the (uh)
they call me they call me miss
#hu#
because they don't my my name is very long right then like (uh) okay never mind (uh) just okay just call me miss #hu#
okay then after that they
[oh] got one kid say (uh) miss #hu# can I go to the toilet please
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> when when she's done
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
(um) can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like !whoa! [eh]
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
(err) <malay>setengah</malay> of the kids like
<malay>setengah</malay> of the forty five kids <malay>yang</malay>
go to school on that day right
<malay>setengah</malay> will go home at one
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so [ah]
[a'ah]
<malay>balik tidur</malay> (uh) no they will they can the parents can only pick them (uh) the parents of the maid [ah]
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this (uh) one (um) one
(uh) no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
(uh) one kid is (err)
half german half japanese actually there's a lot of japanese mix <malay>kat</malay> over there
ya
half german half japanese so
and then (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like literally like
(um)
tell us like okay (uh)
<malay>kat rumah</malay> like this is how I talk to my parents
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like (uh) and then the kids will like [orh] then they will (uh)
try to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
attempt to attempt to say the language also [lah]
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because (uh) the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys [lah] girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime (uh) they (uh) then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
(mm)
before that <malay>dorang makan</malay> so it's like an early lunch like that
<malay>makan</malay> and then
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already [dah]
feed breakfast [lah]
and then after that when they wake up they still <malay>kasi</malay> snacks
they have like a snack [lah] like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that (uh) doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one [kan]
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later [lah]
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
(err) when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring [lah]
<malay>penat penat gila</malay> I think
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no (uh) you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like [oh] my god (uh) and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
and then after that (um) I think he he <malay>apa ni</malay> (um)
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

okay
[a'ah] so <malay>kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap</malay> like in both like <malay>melayu dengan</malay> english so <malay>boleh tak</malay>
so
okay maybe <malay>kita nak cakap pasal</malay> like <malay>kita punya</malay> favourite show <malay>boleh tak</malay>
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
[oh] movie <malay>apa</malay>
okay
why it is sad like
wait like <malay>buta</malay> like like how <malay>buta hati atau</malay> like you know
like [ah] okay
[oh]
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like <malay>kenapa dia buta</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh</malay> then after that
[ah]
wait <malay>tapi</malay> the guy know <malay>yang</malay> like like
the guy is <malay>dia apa tu yang punca yang</malay> the girl <malay>punya</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
<malay>lelaki tu</malay> !wah!
ya
why so weird
<malay>memang macam</malay> like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya [lah] but like <malay>macam</malay> it's so coincidental you know like <malay>macam</malay> the girl <malay>dengan</malay> the guy is like
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>kedai</malay> ya
what
but <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think <malay>kena tengok</malay> right
but that's really your favourite movie
your <malay>abang</malay> is my <malay>adik</malay>
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
I think it's kind of <malay>takde lagi</malay> is it
<malay>pasal dia</malay> ya <malay>dia orang dah</malay> remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like <malay>perempuan</malay> you know like the girls and then like [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> like when I watch it I was like [oh] my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know (uh) <malay>macam baca buku</malay> all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he I think <malay>dia orang ada</malay> like <malay>sepuluh</malay> seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that <malay>lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>tiga puluh lebih</malay> and until like
all of them I think almost all of them get married
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you <malay>tengok</malay> like <malay>macam dia orang</malay> like grow to become like a better person
so <malay>macam</malay> damn cool because I also because like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam banyak orang ingatkan</malay> like <malay>orang yang suka</malay> science <malay>semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil</malay> like very awkward right like they feel like they <malay>macam</malay> cannot fit into the society
ya
socially less awkward and also because like <malay>macam</malay> if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
because like I remember one episode [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy <malay>nama</malay> sheldon
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
school like not really a professor [lah] by research scientists and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like (um) <malay>banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh</malay> fit in
but then over the years <malay>apa dia dia dia cuba</malay> like fit in to like parties <malay>macam</malay> because <malay>ada seorang perempuan</malay> popular <malay>ni</malay> neighbour <malay>dia</malay>
[kan] and then like (um) <malay>dia</malay> like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they will they will feeling very awkward because <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> like <malay>cuba</malay> to interact with like the rest
ya <malay>dia orang semua ingatkan dia</malay> weird <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>dia datang pun</malay> like <malay>dengan baju tak senonoh</malay>
until the party and cannot fit in [lah] but then <malay>lepas tu</malay> then he realise that [oh] my god
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
<malay>apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok</malay> show <malay>ni daripada kecil</malay> call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing [lah] because like <malay>dia dia dia pun</malay> like was single all the way then <malay>lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan</malay> [ah] <malay>kahwin</malay> then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then <malay>tak</malay> he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> to like
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise <malay>betul tak</malay> like he cannot like
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
ya so they actually show us <malay>yang macam</malay> love
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
<malay>terus</malay> jump to it
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> carry <malay>macam</malay> opposite of each other
ya so <malay>dia orang</malay> cuddle cuddle <malay>dia macam</malay> like [eh] let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy <malay>macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu</malay> then like
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh] because you <malay>pakai</malay> like all the <malay>duit</malay> birthday for all this
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
I know you said you show me the photos [mah] and then <malay>macam</malay> it's damn nice [what]
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
no [lah] but waffle [kan] <malay>macam murah takkan</malay> they will charge you [lah]
okay but #haji# lane is overpriced <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually <malay>murah</malay> ya but it's at where somerset
farrer park ya but the thing is
that means like <malay>macam kalau</malay> they are not like at the central area of singapore [kan] it's usually cheaper
very circular
ya [lah] that's why it's cheaper [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if it if it's at town right confirm <malay>mahal</malay>
actually ya
(uh huh)
what no [lah] but <malay>tu untuk buka</malay> like cafe in singapore quite
like tough [what]
so you become like <malay>ibu</malay>
but you know
design the place itself [kan] <malay>macam</malay> they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
ya but it's not
it's not it's very <malay>mahal</malay> and like ya
it's like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we it's like our like previous <malay>kedai</malay> [lor]
ya it's like you need to know <malay>makanan apa sedap</malay> and then like sometimes [kan] you hire the chef and the <malay>dia tak tahu masak</malay>
ya
no but actually <malay>makanan tak sedap pun tak apa</malay> [tau] cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like <malay>macam</malay> it's cool [lah] like
you know like your <malay>makanan</malay> K cause your <malay>makanan tak sedap</malay> [kan] at least your coffee <malay>sedap</malay> or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
ya ya [lah] you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee <malay>macam tak ada gula</malay>
ya like <malay>takde gula</malay> is like totally fine with me ya
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
K [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
actually I want to ask you [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts (um) if you have like <malay>tiga</malay> like wish that you wanna wanna
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
ya like okay like <malay>kalau tak ada macam</malay> K if like there's no boundaries because you know like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee kuan yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich I can't remember
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like [oh] I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like [kan] like <malay>duit apa tu apa tu</malay> it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar [kan] <malay>tak</malay> fun
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know [what]
what
okay I think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
cause like I feel like I'm <malay>macam sangat</malay> lost
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
there's too many like <malay>macam</malay> like direction that you can go like because you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you stay in malaysia then like ya <malay>tak banyak</malay> ya like I think you will only get like
like [kan] <malay>siapa</malay> like most people will go either retail and then like or office world [lah] because in singapore we <malay>kita kita</malay> believe in like equality right
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
so that's why I like I like the so for me <malay>macam</malay> like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working [kan] like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
like you know
even though I know it pays well like <malay>gaji besar</malay> but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's <malay>penat</malay> and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay [lah] maybe you <malay>kalau</malay> you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start <malay>macam betul susah</malay>
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya <malay>bukan</malay> like the
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
ya cause you know like if you go #jakarta# like I don't know you wait did go #batam# ya you went #batam# before right and you know like <malay>macam</malay> some places are very crowded then you know they don't care [one] ya
no but maybe maybe because like
they do though because that time I went national gallery then <malay>dia orang semua duduk dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang semua</malay> loiter <malay>dekat</malay> you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then <malay>kena pekik</malay> [sia] they were like !oi! is you new like why
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend [lah] then I was like [oh] my god what's this maid doing [ah]
[eh] ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya I <malay>tak kisah</malay> so I just like walk away and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
ya because it's okay [lah] but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
<malay>tapi</malay> like
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
you are just lucky cause like in singapore <malay>macam</malay> even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya so we all ya I think singapore <malay>bagi kita</malay> like money to like spend for all these trips [sia] so I think it's like I think that's a good thing [eh]
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young [lah] I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya [ah] pokemon all this you know and then I was like
[oh] my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
!wah!
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
<malay>dia</malay> sounds like internship [kan] then I was like !wah!
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and I when #nara# I went like #kanazawa# then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] I went with my friend but I went (um) I think I went #hiroshima# alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow I think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know I went korea [oh] my god
I showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only [ah] it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have [ah] thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no [lah] I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
#wei# you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
ya <malay>macam</malay> like people from korea guam that's why
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition [mah]
ya
no [lah] (um) I think K because
<malay>macam</malay> like <malay>banyak orang</malay> that like
most of them [lah] actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so (uh) it's their first language [lah] english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
(um) you know the #seoul# tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya #wei# you didn't know I went all these !wah! it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also [lah] that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper [what]
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in #temasek# my microsoft
korea bought my bags [mah]
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business <malay>macam</malay> it's easy to
okay [lah] it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like <malay>macam</malay> I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
ya
[oh] you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
!huh!
you should go with <malay>afal adik</malay>
I feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went #batam# with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like [oh] no I cannot eat it's [oh] no like this place is
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know <malay>macam tempat</malay>
<malay>tak bersih sangat</malay> [lah] also it's okay ya ya they don't care [one]
but then he was like then ya and then he was like why why the hotel smell then I'm like
hotel supposed to smell that way you know
and then we went massage right ya like yes then he was like why is the machine like so weak
I'm like
if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
[oh] ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage [lah]
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment (err) one star price then I was like
!alamak! why you like that
and then (um)
then then I was like
ya then okay
so okay how about you which country you would like to go

if you were born rich okay if you were born rich singapore
then okay what question you wanna ask do you have any question you wanna ask
ya
what that's so random
no [ah] we're talking [what]
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail [what] if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting [lah]
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other [kan]
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
like <malay>selamat datang ke</malay> podcast <malay>saya</malay>
ya but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> like podcast [kan] <malay>ada</malay>
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
(mmhmm)
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no [lah] like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why <malay>bapa</malay> all listening to podcast now
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
okay for myself [lah] [eh] <malay>apa yang</malay> I wish for is
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like (uh)
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich [what]
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for (um)
is benefit for myself and my family [lah]

then (uh) <malay>kalau macam tak pun kita buat</malay> plan <malay>macam pergi</malay> picnic <malay>ke apa</malay>
so whenever <malay>kita ada kita punya</malay> own car
<malay>ke kita nak beli</malay> grocery <malay>nak pergi</malay> shopping at least we got our own car
so we can bring whole family go shopping together [ha]
since we got a big family right [ah] okay [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> car so
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere [lah]
when you got a big family right it's much easier
[ah] rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen (uh) we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood [lah] [eh] if anybody
[ah] emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
[ah] so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money [ha]
everything about money [lah] [eh]
because although once you being rich you still think about money [ah] that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
(uh) I want to have a baby [lah] at least <malay>kalau ada</malay>
stable <malay>punya ni</malay>
(uh) stable financial [eh]
(uh) at least <malay>dah boleh ada anak</malay>
<malay>pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli</malay> pampers <malay>nak beli susu</malay> everything [kan]
[ah] so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>lebih baik</malay> (uh)
<malay>dah ada</malay> stable <malay>semua</malay> financial <malay>baru ada</malay> baby [ah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> stable <malay>nanti anak nak makan apa</malay> [kan]
<malay>takkan nak kebulur makan pasir</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>jadi</malay> at least <malay>kalau kita dah ada duit</malay> [ah] at least we also
<malay>sebelum jadi</malay> richest <malay>pun kita nak kena pandai</malay> save <malay>duit</malay>
[ah] save <malay>duit</malay> you need to have plan about money [ha]
<malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>kalau kau dah</malay> plan [ah] <malay>semua jadi</malay> at least <malay>bila kau ada anak</malay>
<malay>nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan</malay> cheap [eh]

it's okay since <malay>dia boleh bawa</malay> husband <malay>dia sekali</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(um) you know that (uh)
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
[ah] they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you [lah]
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest (uh) maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso [kan]
so maybe <malay>barang-barang yang kita beli kat</malay> daiso <malay>tu kita boleh buat sendiri</malay> [lah] <malay>tampal sendiri</malay>
tapi apa yang <malay>aku rasa lagi</malay> save is <malay>macam hari ni</malay> birthday our cousin [kan] then the next day birthday <malay>abang</malay> [kan]
my husband [eh] <malay>jadi</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam kita buat macam</malay>
(uh) eleven plus <malay>gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas</malay> so at least <malay>kita</malay> celebrate
<malay>satu kali jalan</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [kan] so it's better right
so at least time <malay>kita</malay> celebrate okay (uh) <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>tiup tiup tiup</malay> [oh] okay okay <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kira macam satu</malay> cake
[ah] then <malay>kita</malay> celebrate <malay>untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu</malay>
(mm) so like that better right
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
(uh) <malay>kita</malay> picnic <malay>kat</malay> west coast <malay>ke</malay> east coast <malay>ke</malay>
marina <malay>ke</malay>
(err)
ya [lah] marina is nice [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(err) whatsoever [lah] <malay>payung besar sudah</malay>
(mmhmm)
splash
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
actually right I got saw that time inside a website [ah] I not sure is it at west coast <malay>ke</malay> east coast
<malay>yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam khemah kat dalam ada</malay> sofa <malay>ada macam</malay> I think it's sofa ya
I think that one is quite cheap also
because (um) that time I saw a youtuber
<malay>dia orang buat</malay> (uh) <malay>ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira macam tempat murah-murah</malay> [lah] <malay>kat macam</malay>
<malay>yang kau boleh ni</malay> [ah] <malay>kira boleh</malay> chill chill <malay>dia orang cakap</malay>
<malay>sekali aku tengok</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] not bad <malay>siak dalam ada ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>kira macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang tengok ada</malay> table <malay>kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu</malay> sofa
[ah] <malay>itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar</malay> so if raining <malay>dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this [lah]
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
[ah]
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
[ah] so maybe we can go for that one [ah]
(mm) so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you [ah] so we no need to go for separate rooms [what]
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk [ah]
cannot gathering [ah] cannot make side illegal gathering
[ah] cannot gossip [ah]
so at least at least [lah] (mm) so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but (uh) morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing <malay>ke</malay> zipline <malay>ke</malay> if
have [lah]
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle [ah] I not sure
but they can (uh) ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride [ha]
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part [lah] that we can do
[ah]
maybe we can plan saturday morning
(mm) no maybe afternoon
[oh] ya because actually we don't want
(um)
we don't want
<malay>abang</malay> to (mm)
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
(mmhmm)
the next morning we go cycling
[oh] over there if I not wrong got burger king [eh]
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin [ah]
ya that's why
but I think (uh) over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure [ah]
(hmm) maybe we can search everything
(um)
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I don't like to roller blade [lah] actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see [seh] don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay [lah] nevermind [lah]
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
!alah! !huh!
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it [lah]
like that [lor]
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct [lah] it's boring [lah] because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
but <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay> [ah]
ya very very cold
(mmhmm) ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event

but you know like this kind of
[ah] <malay>tempat</malay> sometimes especially weekend
always have (uh) family gathering [kan]
so I think like <malay>kita nak kena</malay> book
(uh) <malay>ni cepat sikit</malay>
(mm)
if not <malay>kita terlambat kita tak dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>tempat</malay>
maybe some of us <malay>ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu</malay> so at least
<malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa sampai siang</malay> [kan]
<malay>kalau sampai siang</malay> at least <malay>kita ada tempat</malay> [tau] <malay>ada tempat</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay> book <malay>untuk berapa orang</malay>
[ah] so at least <malay>dah ada orang</malay> [tau]
[ah] <malay>dekat tu tempat</malay>
<malay>jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil</malay> [ah]
they
ya but you need to book also you know
[a'ah]
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside !alamak! inside your tent
[ah] then you say [eh] <malay>salah salah salah tempat</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> also cannot [what]
[oh] ya we should have a receipt [eh] (mm)

[kan] <malay>kita nak</malay> grab [kan] <malay>jadi balik</malay> confirm <malay>penat</malay> [pe] <malay>kita dah ada</malay> activity [kan] <malay>lepas tu balik penat</malay> confirm <malay>nak</malay> grab [kan]
so that's why that's why I <malay>cakap yang ini</malay> I <malay>rasa lagi kita boleh</malay> save
<malay>kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh</malay> pack
<malay>semua</malay> pack what I think is
better rather than <malay>kita bawa satu-satu gitu</malay>
then <malay>bawa banyak pinggan</malay>
it's better that <malay>kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu</malay> pack
so <malay>bila tu kita tinggal</malay> pass [jer] <malay>kat</malay> <malay>semua orang</malay>
so <malay>dalam</malay> everything <malay>kita boleh letak</malay> but like <malay>macam dia punya</malay> side

<malay>nasi letak dua bungkus tu</malay> [ah] <malay>letak penuh-penuh</malay>
<malay>jadi kita tak payah ni ataupun letak satu</malay> tupperware
<malay>besar untuk nasi</malay> [jer] because the <malay>lauk-pauk</malay> is already we put different [pe]

<malay>kita boleh minta tolong abang ke kak nani</malay> obvious [ah] <malay>dia tak akan tolong dia mesti kata nak tidur</malay>
(hmm)
[oh] but <malay>abang</malay> also <malay>nanti dia</malay> tired the next day <malay>abang kerja</malay>

(mmhmm)
ya that is what I say

<malay>nasi kita letak dekat benda tu</malay> that's why I <malay>cakap terus nanti boleh buang tak payah ni</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>kita letak dekat</malay> tupperware <malay>jadi kalau kita letak dekat</malay> tupperware
<malay>tak payah ni</malay> so <malay>kita boleh buang</malay>
so you want to use everything all the same [ah]
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> cover <malay>pakai</malay> aluminium foil [jer] aluminium foil is it [a'ah]

!wah!
the whole <malay>kau punya ni</malay>
[ah] rides <malay>kau pegang</malay> [jer] <malay>barang-barang tu</malay>
I think it's better actually I thought of
confirm <malay>kalau semua goreng</malay> confirm <malay>kau akan rasa bosan</malay> [kan]
so I want to cook
(uh) something like maybe <malay>lemak cili padi ke apa</malay>
<malay>tak payah</malay>
<malay>letak</malay> so <malay>kita ada kuah dengan ni</malay>
<malay>tak payah</malay> [eh]
<malay>roti</malay> sandwich yes
of course we have
no need [lah] #kimbap# #kimbap# no need [lah]
(mm)
I think
<malay>apa yang kita perlu ada</malay> since <malay>ada</malay> event [kan] sandwich of course <malay>kena ada</malay>
so (um) that's why I <malay>cakap</malay> at least I <malay>nak letak satu</malay> dish
so <malay>bila ada satu</malay> dish <malay>tu</malay>
[kan]
at least <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>lauk macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kau makan mi dengan</malay>
<malay>lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng</malay> [jer] <malay>kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng</malay>
so at least <malay>kalau ada lauk sikit</malay> because
<malay>kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah</malay> [kan]
that's why I <malay>cakap</malay>
so at least I <malay>nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa</malay> [ah] something like that [lah]
ya like what I say maybe I <malay>nak buat yang tu</malay>
<malay>lemak cili padi ataupun</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay>
(uh) <malay>sambal goreng satu sambal goreng</malay> <malay>satu lemak cili padi</malay>
<malay>sambal goreng</malay> is for mama because mama vegetarian
<malay>kita kena fikir nanti</malay> mama <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>sana ayam</malay>
[eh] <malay>sini ayam</malay>
<malay>abeh sini sini pun ayam abeh aku punya mana</malay>

(mmhmm)
you want to buy <malay>mi</malay> [eh] buy <malay>pula</malay> you want to <malay>masak mi hoon ke mi goreng</malay>

so at least we can save [lah] save a bit
like over there (mm)
so you want to cook <malay>nasi goreng</malay> is it
how about like this

ya [lah] <malay>ikan bilis itu</malay> [lah] that is what I mean
<malay>nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini</malay> [pe] is <malay>warna putih</malay> [what]

(mm)
<malay>abang suruh potong</malay> hotdog [ah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>dua</malay> packet <malay>cukup tak dua</malay> packet <malay>tak cukup empat</malay> packet
<malay>empat</malay> packet [lah] [eh] <malay>empat</malay> packet

<malay>memang aku punya</malay> is like <malay>memang</malay>
slide slide (uh) ni <malay>apa</malay>
slice <malay>dia macam</malay> diagonal is it
diagonal [kan]
[ah] so
<malay>aku tak nak</malay> [lah] macam
<malay>kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar</malay> because
<malay>aku punya orang</malay> is very particular about <malay>dia punya</malay> size <malay>kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau aku buat macam mana dia orang ni kalau suruh masak pun susah</malay>
[ah]
sandwich <malay>lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> especially sandwich <malay>ni aku tak suka</malay> very particular [lah]
[oh] <malay>takpe</malay>
<malay>kita buat macam ni</malay> [jer] <malay>apa kata kita buat</malay>
[ah]
egg tuna sandwich
so <malay>sebelah sapu</malay> tuna [lah]
<malay>lagi sebelah kita letak</malay> egg [lah] egg mayo [lah]
[ah] <malay>jadi bila</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia jadi sedap</malay> [tau] [ah] I think this already good [lah]
so <malay>jadi dia orang tak ni</malay>
<malay>jadi dia orang kalau</malay> at least <malay>dia orang</malay> spread
[ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ni sangat</malay> [kan]
<malay>sayur</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal apa kalau sayur</malay>
<malay>tu yang aku tak nak dia orang buat kalau letak sayur nanti bersepah dia orang buat</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
no
ya because they don't really know <malay>macam mana nak letak</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau pun tahu</malay> [pe] <malay>aku kalau buat</malay> sandwich <malay>aku</malay> very particular <malay>aku nak</malay> make sure sandwich <malay>dia nampak</malay> <malay>cantik</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
so <malay>beli yang ada cili punya</malay>
you know <malay>itu baru sedap</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(ugh) [oh] that's so much work [ah] you need to do [ah]
so the crust <malay>apa awak nak buat ke</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think maybe <malay>kalau macam gini</malay>
since <malay>ada</malay> sandwich and <malay>ada ni</malay> then <malay>kita nak beli</malay>
(uh) since
like that right I think (um)
fishball <malay>nak letak ke</malay>
<malay>ke tak payah</malay>
since (uh) mama <malay>tak makan</malay>
so why not we change it we just (uh) buy everything (uh) veg veg also quite nice [what]
mushroom ball
(mmhmm)
ya nugget fried chicken [ah]
that is what we going to buy [lah]
actually I want to cook fries also
so at least <malay>kita boleh buat</malay> cheese fries
[oh] ya correct because we don't want the food to be soggy right
if not <malay>nanti sampai sana semua dah</malay> taste not nice ya

so I think better right my suggest better right
(mm)

ya why not [ah] buy denim right
denim means <malay>kita</malay> lump sum [pe] <malay>sebab</malay>

which <malay>pada aku</malay> is just (uh) not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to <malay>macam</malay>
a bad woman [ah] basically
<malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> not all <malay>aku tak cakap yang</malay> all beautiful ladies
<malay>perempuan lawa</malay> is basically <malay>jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau katakan</malay> [eh] like ninety per cent
ninety per cent
<malay>kalau</malay> from my point of view [lah] <malay>aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi</malay> [oh] <malay>dia buat kawan aku macam gini</malay> [oh]
it give you <malay>macam</malay> a thought [ah] <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>perempuan lawa macam gini</malay> [ah]

like my like nowadays it's more of <malay>kita</malay> judge the book by its cover [kan]
I mean you can judge a person based on <malay>dia punya</malay> personality first <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> most of the time they judge on looks
just because <malay>dia tak lawa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu</malay>

<malay>macam mak ngan ayah punya</malay> time is more [ah] !wah! <malay>aku suka dia</malay> K [eh] she's the [one] for me <malay>macam gitu</malay> like
like last time people is more of a <malay>macam</malay> loyal [tau] <malay>sekarang</malay> is more of K [ah]
(mm) what you mean
ya attention <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> they need attention [ah]
because now is <malay>kita</malay> living in a modern society [tau] so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with <malay>faham</malay>
and we need to work and we need to think about this and that
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>rabak gila</malay>
that's why they need attention as like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) pleasure
not (uh) pleasure [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
[ah] they need attention because they are young [ah] basically
<malay>kalau</malay> married couple for me <malay>kalau nak</malay> attention is very hard [ah]
for you to get attention if both are working most of (uh) most of the adults now you see is both working [what]
ya is have to
<malay>tapi kalau nak cakap</malay> [kan] [eh] (um)
<malay>aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku</malay> attention <malay>tapi kita</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you're not [ah] giving both
both of like both of your life a chance [tau]
like
<malay>kau nak selalu cakap</malay> I need attention <malay>tapi</malay> you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things <malay>apa</malay>
that's why you're married because you trust each other
<malay>kau faham tak aku cakap</malay>
is it
no [ah] <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> piece together all of it [kan] is <malay>susah juga pasal</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> is more like <malay>kita</malay> have different thoughts different feelings <malay>kita punya</malay> emotions all jumble up
basically
<malay>jadi kita</malay> [ah]
and singapore [eh] <malay>kalau kau nak tahu</malay> [eh] singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world [tau] serious
because of the stress that <malay>macam kita</malay> put on ourselves just to survive every month
that is quite harsh [lah] harsh reality [ah]
and singapore [eh] have the <malay>macam</malay> the highest divorce rate
one of the highest [ah] divorce rate in the world
mostly <malay>melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's very hard [lah] because nowadays more of like <malay>dia orang</malay> (um)
they never think
<malay>dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan</malay> [tau]
they <malay>fikir</malay> okay <malay>macam orang putih cakap</malay> yolo [eh]
you only live once [kan] so they never think <malay>macam</malay> [ah] beyond horizon [tau]
<malay>dorang just fikir</malay> okay (uh) <malay>aku nak</malay> party [ah] all the way but <malay>dia nak kena fikir juga</malay>
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going <malay>macam</malay> downhill [ah]
[kan]
so <malay>pada aku</malay> wise [eh] <malay>nak cakap sekarang punya zaman</malay> is more stress [lah] basically
<malay>tapi yang penting</malay> [eh] <malay>daripada</malay> drama <malay>boleh pergi</malay> marriage
[ah] yes [oh] [ah] yes
I mean like is like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) a playhouse [tau]

<malay>abeh kau boleh buat apa-apa kau nak</malay>
without [ah] without [ah]
without any mistakes [ah] [kan] like
<malay>kau boleh buat</malay> mistake <malay>tapi kau boleh buat mistake tapi</malay> it's (uh) it's scripted ya it can be soft because you're in the playhouse [kan]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>aku ada tu aku ada tu</malay> thought [tau] [eh] what if I were to become this guy this rich guy
what if I <malay>apa kata kalau aku jadi dia ni aku jadi dia tu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> [oh] but it's not going to happen [ah] it's just that <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> thought [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>macam kau</malay> face reality [ah] basically <malay>susah gila</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang pun</malay>
<malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> drama

their chicken chop

<malay>macam</malay> these kind of things especially <malay>mak bapa kau dah tua</malay>
like you wouldn't want them to just be with medishield
then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[ah] that is for disabilities
[oh]
[ah] these all these okay [eh] eldershield careshield or medishield all these [eh] is from government
<malay>apa yang kau bayar untuk</malay> insurance <malay>macam kalau</malay> let's say [ah] the basic [ah] is medishield then <malay>kalau kau</malay> upgrade and then it will be depend on which company you take [ah] your prushield
prudential aviva
sometimes even but these four are the main ones [lah]
then <malay>kalau tak</malay> upgrade <malay>baru kau tahu</malay> but then <malay>bila kau</malay> upgrade poly <malay>kau nak kena tahu</malay> whether <malay>kau punya</malay> is
<malay>atas atau</malay> somewhere in between <malay>macam</malay> parents <malay>aku punya</malay> is just one step below which is B plus is the
rider plan A plus is like not basic [ah] but it's there so <malay>macam</malay>
like <malay>dia orang kalau pergi</malay> private [eh] so <malay>kira macam</malay> emergency <malay>dia orang kena pergi</malay> private they have to pay upfront first
then reimbursement [ah] so that's why <malay>aku selalu cakap dengan</malay> members members [eh]
<malay>kau orang muda kau orang boleh</malay> afford it why not
<malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kau macam kau tengok macam payah kau nak bayar</malay>
but
yearly <malay>kau bayar berapa</malay> when you count
<malay>macam kau</malay> even it out for twelve months
it's <malay>sikit</malay> [seh] it's like forty dollars fifty dollars unless you pay like over thousand over dollars [ah] then
<malay>tu baru</malay>
quite high [ah]
TAQWA
TAQWA <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
<malay>itu apa</malay> islamic <malay>punya apa</malay>
!huh!
[oh]
!aiyo!
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan]
hospital may not recognise [tau]
it may be reimbursement
<malay>asal</malay> hospital <malay>aku takde</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] no
<malay>pasal</malay> I mean
for now [ah] private hospitals they only recognise
prudential aviva so <malay>ni empat</malay> [jer] [tau] most probably <malay>kalau</malay> #ah qing# were to come right she will have to pay first then reimburse
ya so that's how it is [lah] <malay>macam dia dapat</malay> refund <malay>balik</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
these four companies are the only companies that
<malay>kita boleh</malay> try to get electronic letter of guarantee which mean that without deposit so means <malay>kau tak payah bayar</malay> upfront
so so
<malay>tu pasal tu</malay>
government is different
[ah] [ah] because that's why unless you don't I mean that's why I asked you whether <malay>kau</malay> private <malay>ke</malay>
(um)
private <malay>atau</malay> government for your future baby
[oh] okay [lah] government you don't have to worry <malay>macam kawan aku zahirah</malay>
give birth to #aisyah#
three K <malay>dia keluar</malay> cash money
private but after subsidiary [lah] because parkway has this
<malay>aku rasa</malay> they have a very big subsidiary for future mums
[ah] because they <malay>menggalakkan untuk kau mengadakan</malay> baby <malay>dan</malay> breastfeed
ya they they are really big on that [seh] they will get <malay>dia sampai dapat apa tu</malay> nursing
breastfeeding nurse
ya they no a nurse will come and teach her how to breastfeed
like if the baby doesn't latch on then <malay>dia cakap</malay> okay you try this you try that
<malay>terus aku macam</malay>
what
but <malay>tapi bayar</malay> [lah]
but
[oh] that time <malay>kakak ipar aku punya tak</malay> [seh]
with eva
eva <malay>tak</malay> [seh]
maybe
it's a recent recent thing [ah] because when eva was there [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal dia nak</malay> compete <malay>dengan</malay> private <malay>banyak orang pergi</malay> private because of that but at the same time people go to private because it's much more efficient much more faster
because of lesser clientele <malay>macam zahirah punya kakak ipar</malay>
she she was pregnant I think
she was like [oh] <malay>aku tak datang</malay> period
then
that time <malay>dia pergi</malay> hospital <malay>dia macam</malay> okay this is my (err)
<malay>macam</malay> [oh] I already have two kids I should be okay <malay>pergi</malay> then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] you have a mass
<malay>macam</malay> a cyst a cyst a tumour or whatever need to remove so <malay>dia macam hati tak sedap dia pergi</malay> doctor #aziz#
pregnant [ah] [sia] member
ya it's not a mass it's a baby
[ah] wanted to say [oh] we need to bring you for surgery
<malay>dia orang</malay> ultrasound [ah] that's why <malay>tu pasal dia macam</malay> okay whatever I just spend a bit more money just for private
and <malay>anak dia semua</malay> doctor #aziz#
[ah] [ah]
end up
this doctor #aziz# apparently <malay>ada berapa sebelas anak</malay>
that's what I heard <malay>dari makcik aku pasal makcik aku ni</malay> [ah] <malay>pun</malay> doctor <malay>aziz juga</malay>
for <malay>bidan punya</malay> type [ah] for a gynaecologist <malay>tapi aku macam</malay>
<malay>tengok sebelas anak</malay>
<malay>sebelas</malay> [sia] <malay>ramai</malay> [sia] <malay>tu anak</malay>
<malay>tu pasal</malay> but <malay>dia orang cakap anak dia paling kecil</malay> is quite young
I don't know maybe <malay>dia masih nak kena tanggung</malay> for <malay>sekolah</malay>
ya because they are much more gentler that's what I heard also then after that I'm like
then how my gynae female [leh]
[oh] <malay>pasal</malay> [oh] <malay>pasal kau</malay>
[ah] [ah]
but <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang takde macam</malay> one certain doctor with your condition like this

(uh) <malay>kerjanya</malay> insurance
but <malay>aku nak kena pergi</malay> A&E <malay>nak kena dia orang</malay> check then after that you need to give some
<malay>bedek bedek</malay> then in order for you to see a gynae then after that tell them to give me pap smear
[ah] <malay>terus aku macam</malay> !huh! because if <malay>kalau aku pergi</malay> straight <malay>aku kena bayar</malay> out of pocket <malay>aku tak boleh pakai kerja punya</malay> insurance so <malay>aku macam</malay> (mm)
is it worth the ten the fifteen dollars <malay>pasal</malay> five dollars A&E ten dollars specialist

<malay>terus dia cakap</malay>
(um)
every night <malay>dia kena kacau</malay>
<malay>dia macam rasa tak tenteram kat dalam situ terus aku macam</malay>
<malay>abeh ada orang macam</malay> come to defense [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia macam dia kena fitnah</malay> [seh]
<malay>dia kena fitnah pasal dia sembahyang lima waktu</malay> then son of peach <malay>cakap kau fikir kau jaga barang ni semua tak senang ke</malay> of course <malay>kau nak kena sembahyang lima waktu</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau tak benda ni makan kau</malay>

<malay>tak macam selama ni dia tahu macam</malay> black magic <malay>ni kau pun nak kena sembahyang lima waktu jadi benda-benda ni semua tak kacau kau</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> at the same time [kan] <malay>aku tak rasa dia ada</malay> black magic
like in the first place he she doesn't have
that <malay>ilmu kebal</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dia punya</malay> intention to just <malay>pakai duit sidek ni</malay>
[ah]
<malay>pakai duit yang siapa ni yang mati ni</malay> then <malay>bila dia bunuh</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>pakai</malay> [jer] <malay>pasal</malay> she had no intention of covering it up <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> maybe the intention is just to <malay>buat pakai duit ni bunuh</malay>
then on the disguise of <malay>ada ilmu kebal</malay>
[ah]
(mm) but at the same time <malay>dia ada</malay> practice <malay>dia macam</malay> small time small time [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>macam orang yang kat</malay> quaters <malay>dekat</malay>
malaysia <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>semua cakap semua macam nampak dia</malay>
<malay>bebas bebas nampak dia semua</malay>
<malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] my god [oh] my god
<malay>abeh bila aku kerja kat</malay> [kan] <malay>aku punya</malay> colleague <malay>cakap apa</malay> [tau] [eh] <malay>kau tahu mona fandey</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu tahu asal asal kau nampak dia aku nampak satu makcik ni macam dia pakai kebaya semua</malay>

[oh] <malay>atau orang macam mona fandey aku pekik</malay> [lah] [sial]
<malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
[kan] [ah] <malay>dia orang cakap yang kat</malay> quarters <malay>ni dia orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>dia macam selalu asal cepat sangat asal cepat sangat macam</malay> from three to six <malay>dia orang akan nampak</malay>
<malay>pasal dia nak kena gantung lepas subuh apa</malay> so <malay>dia macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>asal cepat sangat ni dia cakap jangan cepat sangat</malay> [lah] <malay>tu macam</malay> !ee! <malay>seramnya aku</malay>
<malay>tapi siapa yang duduk</malay> cell <malay>dia akan kena gantung</malay>
[ah] <malay>pasal aku rasa</malay> cell <malay>dia</malay> it's just for those <malay>yang akan kena gantung</malay> <malay>nanti aku macam</malay> (mm) and recently <malay>kakak ipar aku pun macam dia kakak ipar aku sekolah</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia tanya</malay>
what is your opinion on the sentence
on drug offenses
then I said I'm for it and I'm not for it [lah] because
sometimes people who <malay>banyak orang kena gantung</malay>
because of self consumption
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>pasal</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> amount for hanging is quite high
[eh] it's quite low <malay>kalau macam kau</malay> five gram [jer] <malay>kau dah boleh kena gantung padahal tu</malay> five gram is <malay>cukup untuk kau pakai sendiri</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay>
I'm for it I'm not for it [lah] because there's
<malay>banyak melayu kena gantung</malay> [seh] <malay>yang kena gantung melayu</malay>
[ah]
mostly malays <malay>yang si cina ni semua dapat</malay>
so <malay>aku macam</malay> it's it's already like [lah] where
<malay>apa</malay> heavy
sentencings for the black communities and the latinos communities for the same drug offenses
ya
yes
no [lah] in like the
the jurisdictional
[ah]
<malay>tapi kakak kakak ipar aku pun berbual pasal dia kerja kat dalam</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pun ada cakap kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>yang si cina-cina ni semua</malay> blue collar [sia] [eh] <malay>cina-cina semua</malay> white collar crime crimes [sia] and <malay>duit dia orang banyak-banyak kau orang punya duit sikit-sikit duduk berapa lama</malay>
<malay>kakak ipar aku cakap</malay> think of it [ah] look at it
(mm)
and also <malay>dia pun tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how she feels about the death penalty I mean <malay>kalau betul-betul pada aku macam orang yang patut kena bunuh</malay> is rapist <malay>kena</malay> hang <malay>ni yang</malay> rapists child molesters they should be hanged but apparently <malay>dia orang kena</malay> serve time then after that they come out <malay>mana boleh</malay>
<malay>pada aku rotan tak cukup</malay> [sia] bro
[ah] <malay>rotan dua empat kali pun tak cukup</malay>
<malay>kau patut kena mati</malay>
<malay>atau jadikan</malay> subject of experiments
instead of like testing on animals test it on them
but there's human rights [lah] so <malay>aku macam</malay> whatever [lah] this people are not humans
<malay>entah</malay> because I think <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang fikir macam</malay> the drugs can ruin our children our future
that was their thinking [lah] so <malay>aku macam</malay>
whatever [lah] because there's much more heinous crimes
<malay>selain dari membunuh</malay>
<malay>merogol mencabul kanak-kanak</malay>
<malay>ni semua</malay> [sia] <malay>dia orang patut</malay> they should actually look into it [seh]
but
I can
drugs but I'm like <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
<malay>kau sedar macam</malay> it's like
a human life <malay>memang betul</malay> [lah] both of them play with human lives but then
sure they say they may like these rape rape victims may not be
<malay>kau kentut</malay> [eh]
these rape victims may not be <malay>macam</malay>
they are alive [ah] but <malay>dia</malay> traumatised for life
and <malay>badan dia orang rabak</malay> [seh]
[ah] [seh]
and <malay>badan dia orang</malay> may change <malay>macam rabak</malay> like what if they get pregnant from the rapists like [eh] <malay>jangan bodoh</malay> [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[ah] <malay>boleh makan dalam</malay> [ah] (mm)
but <malay>aku tak tahu dia orang ni semua macam mana</malay>
then <malay>aku macam</malay>
why do you care so much
about the human life who have ruined another human like a lot of these drug not drug traffickers I'm not saying about drug traffickers [lah] <malay>banyak dia orang makan sendiri</malay> like they use it for their own consumption they are not selling
so like
!hais!
(mm)
but <malay>kalau kau tengok dia punya</malay> amount is not <malay>macam lima</malay>
[ah]
it's not like
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>aku ada</malay> [ah] <malay>ni satu</malay> case <malay>kat</malay> #yishun# <malay>yang pakcik</malay> ya uncle [lah]

[ah]
that happens [lah] that happens [lah] but then also at the same time I don't blame them solely because
<malay>si melayu ni pun musibat</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
(mm)
and also they live up to the stereotype <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
<malay>macam kat</malay> #geylang# that time <malay>aku yana aku tengok asal dia ni macam</malay> weird <malay>aku dah mata dah tak nampak sangat tangan ada gam</malay>

(hmm)
<malay>entah</malay>
<malay>tahu</malay> I know I know but then for for shoe right
[ah] since I already have money right
but I only can ask for this much amount of money
so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right

what is wrong with your love life
<malay>apa yang</malay> like
<malay>tak</malay> worth it [lah] of course it's not gonna be worth it what because like
because like you know (err)
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
your life would be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
life <malay>tak bagus</malay> [ah]
easy to say it's like it won't be good [ah] everything will just be everything [oh] I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate [ah] so like

worth it [ah]
<malay>dapat semua benda</malay> [pe]
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life [ah] for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
[ah]
I mean everybody has their own opinion [what]
their own opinions in life
like <malay>dorang nak apa</malay> like
<malay>sorang ada sorang nya</malay> opinion [pe] so like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you know if our opinions are different right then it is what it is [ah] like ya

in that's what I look for in a girl [ah]
<malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm)
okay we talking about this minor details in women that I look for of course there is [lah] there are a few [ah] so I'll tell you about my life [ah] like I can be honest [ah] <malay>dalam hidup aku</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku keluar dengan tiga perempuan</malay> [jer] [tau]
<malay>tiga perempuan</malay> the first one she can make me laugh she (uh) <malay>boleh buat aku ketawa semua</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> take it one step too far she make me laugh too much
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say [lah] like too playful [ah]
like <malay>macam dia suka main-main aku</malay> text <malay>tak nak</malay> reply <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>abeh berbual</malay> serious
serious <malay>punya benda dia</malay>
<malay>dia macam buat macam kelakar semua</malay> then you know
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she [ah] <malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
handle jokes <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>kena aku selalu kena</malay> care for her [ah] like
<malay>takleh kena takleh kena sikit ke apa</malay> [ah]
then <malay>bila berbual dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>nak buat macam</malay> joke <malay>kelakar semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dia dia nak sepak aku sepak muka aku ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari gaduh</malay> so the third one right
she's a good mix in between [ah] like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall [ah]
but then turns out I'm not her type [ah] so if that that one I cannot do anything [ah] but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course [ah] every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus [ah]
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
to be needy you know like I don't want her to be too needy like <malay>selalu</malay>
like <malay>dia selalu macam</malay>
<malay>cari aku dia nak ni dia nak ni</malay>
so like <malay>semua benda semua benda dia</malay>
like <malay>cari aku</malay>
then <malay>aku kena pergi sana jumpa dia berbual dengan dia dia nak nangis aku kena gi sana semua</malay>
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want [ah] I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
<malay>cam dia tengah</malay> contact <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>satu orang satu laki ke kau takut</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
!whoa!
[ah]
feeling feeling <malay>kau macam mana</malay> feeling
happy <malay>gila ke apa</malay>
process [ah]
process your morning
you're like in a fifty fifty state of mind [lah] <malay>kalau dia</malay> reply then
<malay>kau berbual kalau dia tak</malay> reply then
<malay>buat bodoh</malay> [jer] [ah]
[ah] okay
[ah] <malay>aku kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kerja kat ni</malay>
<malay>kat kau tahu</malay> SingPost
[ah] <malay>aku kerja kat</malay> SingPost [ah] <malay>cam</malay>
<malay>aku tengah kerja</malay> morning shift [eh] <malay>tak silap</malay> morning shift
[ah] <malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku rasa tu kerja apa aku tak ingat</malay> [ah] but then ya
[a'ah]
so like <malay>macam</malay> start conversation <malay>dengan dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cam</malay>
<malay>berbual</malay>
did she seem like interested in you <malay>dia macam</malay>
(um) <malay>ada tunjuk kau dia ada suka kau ke ada</malay>
(mm)
it was just like out the blue [ah]
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first first everything [lah]
it's like your first breakup [ah] you don't know how to handle [lah]
[oh]
I couldn't take it [lah] <malay>aku nangis cam</malay> day and night <malay>aku nangis nangis aku pun tak tahu asal aku nangis</malay>
<malay>kalau aku fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu pun aku asal aku nangis</malay>
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments [what] but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs [what]
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like [oh] this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated [ah] some would say
so ya
but then when she
<malay>minta dia nak minta</malay> break
<malay>dia nak minta</malay> breakup then <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [lah] like we never say anything but we there was no like
labels [ah] I would say
like <malay>kita kita tak</malay> label
<malay>kita macam</malay> boyfriend girlfriend <malay>mata air tak</malay>
<malay>kita tak macam kita macam</malay> just go with the flow [ah]
<malay>boleh cakap gitu</malay> [ah] go with the flow [jer]
(mm)
so you just became like a emotional guy [ah]
<malay>cam jadi</malay> emotional [ah]
like you just needed like reasons [ah] like you want to solve it [ah] like you don't want to just breakup
like that [ah]
like <malay>kau tak nak</malay> let go <malay>dia cam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>kau nak macam</malay> rebuilt <malay>semua</malay> you know
so like you try to you know talk to her [lah] but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you [ah]
she
move on [ah] so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky [lah] your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good [ah] because like
[sial] [lah] <malay>aku pun nak</malay> [sia] <malay>kalau</malay> first try <malay>dapat macam boleh cam</malay> like the perfect girlfriend
like the perfect wife [ah] <malay>boleh cakap</malay>
so like ya [lah]
[a'ah] [seh]
this one <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> [kan]
in this world [ah]
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
<malay>tak</malay> this is different because right anything you want for free
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
[a'ah]
<malay>satu benda</malay> [jer] <malay>benda</malay> free
<malay>apa-apa kau nak</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>tak tak muak ke hari-hari makan</malay> Pizza Hut
so what did you leave her for someone
(mm)
so like you pretty much just stalk her first [ah] <malay>cam tengok orang ni macam mana</malay>
so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
<malay>ni perempuan macam</malay> not bad [ah]
<malay>cam</malay> this is the [one] [ah]
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
(mm)
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings [ah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> fade [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] that's good that's good
[ah] to be honest [ah]
it depends on how the break up went [ah]
<malay>kau faham tak macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kita punya</malay> break up <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau punya macam senang macam</malay> just ended smoothly like no hiccups or anything then okay [lah] <malay>boleh jadi kawan tapi macam</malay>
<malay>kawan pun bukan macam</malay> best friend <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kawan macam</malay> low-key <malay>macam boleh cakap</malay> [ah] hi bye friends [ah]
<malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> technically <malay>kawan tak</malay> [ah] you know what I mean
it's like
ya
so like
but then <malay>kalau</malay> break up <malay>macam rabak kita macam gaduh semua</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> like
try <malay>jadi kawan balik macam susah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
what's the point [kan] ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't [ah]
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends [ah]
do you still searching for love or anything
[ah]
[oh]
[ah]
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh]
(mm)
[ah]
you just try to care for her [lah] like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares [ah]
[ah]
that's
that's a super hard question [ah] because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> [kan] like [ah] <malay>kalau aku</malay> just break up then <malay>aku nak</malay> move on it takes me like at least at least [ah] four months I would say
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended [ah]
like
it really depends on the person [ah] like <malay>kalau aku cam</malay>
<malay>kalau aku</malay> handsome <malay>gila ke apa ke</malay> then (uh)
<malay>senang-senang dapat perempuan semua aku tak</malay> [kan] move on
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>berapa berapa lama</malay> [kan]
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on [lah]
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this [one]
were you still moving on
ya
(mm)
your second girl your ex [lah]
[ah]
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
it's not wrong [ah] it's not completely wrong <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] <malay>kalau cam</malay> care <malay>pasal</malay> ex <malay>kau ke apa</malay> it's not wrong it's like
<malay>macam</malay>
how you say [ah] like you like imagine if you lost your phone right and <malay>kau hilang</malay> then
<malay>tu benda tu</malay> phone <malay>kau takleh cari mana-mana</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [dah] <malay>hilang</malay> [ah]
<malay>ni mesti macam</malay> two years down the road two years the road <malay>kau mesti fikir balik</malay> [eh]
phone <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>aku rasa kat kat sini ke</malay>
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that [ah]
it's like something that is lost can never be found again [ah]
<malay>dorang cakap</malay> [ah]
people say this one
so like ya
(ugh)
ya
totally not wrong
(mm)
in my in my relationships [ah] my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me [ah] I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like <malay>macam</malay>
example [eh] example <malay>macam</malay> one of the times (err)
<malay>ni perempuan dia nak berbual dengan aku dia sedih dia nak</malay> she needs someone to talk to [ah] pretty much so I just decided like <malay>macam tapi aku aku tengah main</malay> game
<malay>kau tahu</malay> game [kan] <malay>macam</malay> phone <malay>nya</malay> game then <malay>aku macam</malay>
[eh] [sial] [lah] <malay>aku nak main</malay> game <malay>tapi ni perempuan tengah nangis ni aku nak buat apa</malay> [sia]
so like
I I just give another <malay>macam aku kasi</malay>
<malay>alasan</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku</malay> busy [ah] <malay>berbual nanti boleh tak</malay> see like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now [ah] like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course [ah] I I I feel like sometimes I
I <malay>macam tak</malay> (uh) <malay>buat banyak</malay>
<malay>buat banyak salah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know I do a lot of wrong [ah] in relationships [ah] but
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn [ah]
so like [ah]
(mm)
it's like you just live [ah] like your future self think about that in the future [ah] I get what you mean
so like ya like you know [ah]
you always got to know [ah] sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship [ah] so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
it is what it is [ah] like <malay>kalau benda tak</malay>
[ah] go the way you want it to then
sorry man
life is doesn't work in your favour all the time
(mm)
[ah]
<malay>tapi tadi kau cakap macam</malay> live in the moment [kan] that's a very
good thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> live in the moment like it's a very good thing [ah]
like you know it's like don't think too much [ah] pretty much don't put [ah]

<malay>fikir</malay> what you have right in front of you like
[oh] I don't have money now what should I do
or should work and earn my money like that
it's like you don't really think about future I mean you should think about your future when you're getting older but right now <malay>cam sekarang</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita jangan fikir</malay> just live in the moment [ah] it's like

okay dear (um)
just a question
we planned about going to korea south korea
<malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>nak pergi sana</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> you think that it's a <malay>macam</malay>
we should go there [lah] you know
aside from that
you sure you like korean food [ah]
I thought you don't
you don't like
(um)
<malay>macam</malay> fishy fishy stuff you know
but the problem is weather what if
it's cold
it's cold and you (uh) <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay> you know <malay>tak tahan sejuk</malay>
so you are you are telling me that <malay>kita kena</malay> shop before <malay>kita pergi</malay> korea
no
that's not what you're supposed to do
but the question is when no [lah] kidding
let let let's leave that to later [lah] but
(um)
I the the thing is that I want to go there <malay>sebab</malay> I've been there
so
it's a place whereby I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tempat ini bagus untuk bawa</malay> partner [ah] you know
to have
a good time with my partner
so
ya that's why I wanna go there
I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> if there
they have #mukshidonna# there <malay>tapi</malay>
better than nothing right
but in korea
there will be a lots of walking
I'm not sure if you can <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tahan</malay>
there's not much escalator there's a lot of stairs
excuse me all the more we shouldn't bring a lot of stuff
<malay>sebab kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> shopping <malay>dekat sana</malay>
<malay>bawa benda</malay> bring light pack light [lah] you know
confirm <malay>berat</malay>
that's why you should pack light
so that you can shop more
that question
we shall leave it to our budget
no [lah]
since it's far right there's no point going for like like you know like a short trip
might as well like take a one week
trip you know since we are already there
or maybe more than one week
seven
I don't know what is that
but then again right
I wanna go there when it's winter <malay>tapi</malay>
I'm just afraid that <malay>kalau</malay>
you know [lah] <malay>kita tak tahan sejuk</malay>
I <malay>tak tahan</malay> but you know
I <malay>tak</malay> I I <malay>tak pernah</malay> experience snow you know so
what more if it's the first time with you
I get to experience snow

<malay>tak</malay> #shiok#
<malay>tak</malay> #shiok# [lah] <malay>siapa nak nak nak</malay> fall sick in on holiday [seh]
but I think you'll like it there [lah] <malay>sebab apa</malay> [eh]
there's a lot first thing there's a lot of cosmetics
and it's cheap
no it's not plastic surgery cosmetics like makeup stuff
but then I thought I I'm not sure that you <malay>pakai</malay> [lah] brand brand <malay>itu semua sebab</malay>
korean brand [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> etude you know etude house
there's a lot of hand cream <malay>dengan</malay> face masks very cheap there
ya socks
face mask hand cream
innisfree
!huh! no no such thing
but <malay>banyak banyak</malay>
all those korean brands [ah] like etude house innisfree
<malay>dekat sana lebih murah</malay> [lah] compared to you <malay>sini</malay> [ah]
!ee! no
we concentrate on korea <malay>dulu [ah] apa cakap</malay> australia
that one might be after korea [lah]
because if I want to go australia I want it to be like <malay>macam</malay>
a road trip [tau] you know like <malay>macam</malay> you know melbourne [eh] like from sydney we drive down to other places
I don't know [ah]

it's not
it's not really like from sydney to melbourne it's like let's say you drop in sydney then you go drive somewhere
or maybe from melbourne then you go drive somewhere
<malay>macam</malay> we get to see the <malay>apa itu</malay>
scenery twelve apostle's <malay>yang dia orang tengok itu semua</malay>
melbourne right [ah]
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay>
I'm not a good driver
I can drive
I can drive but I cannot
stay woke

that will take
another five years I <malay>rasa sebab nak kira-kira</malay> plan <malay>dua tahun</malay>

so okay [lah]
I'm a trusted driver
I'm a safety driver you know I check my blindspot

if we could eat one food for the rest of our life
what would it be
(hmm)
<malay>sama</malay> [lah] I also
because <malay>bila</malay> food

but nugget <malay>pun</malay> chicken [what]
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(hmm)
if it's one <malay>lauk</malay> for the rest of my life
<malay>apa sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>ketupat</malay> or with <malay>nasi</malay>
or <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>bergedil</malay> and <malay>nasi</malay>
ya
and sis <malay>tak akan</malay> get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent <malay>makanan yang</malay> I crave for is
<malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> [lah]
like ya because to me like <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is
life
<malay>sebab</malay> you will have everything there
you got <malay>paru</malay>
you got
<malay>ada</malay> veggie [ah] <malay>ada sambal kacang panjang</malay>
<malay>ada tahu tempeh</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> chicken
<malay>hati ayam pedal</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam ke pedal</malay> [eh]
<malay>limpa</malay> [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
<malay>lagi-lagi ada udang</malay>
[ah] so <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is like everything that I like to eat is what <malay>macam satu</malay> dish you <malay>makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap</malay> [seh]
but it's considered one [what] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
(oo) <malay>tak</malay> consider [eh]
why why <malay>macam</malay> why like that
what <malay>tapi itu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi</malay> sis
<malay>pulut begitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>pulut tak ada rasa</malay> sis
one food [lah]
<malay>pulut</malay> [lah] but you cannot put other <malay>lauk</malay>
[ah] one food [what] it's like one like it's like one dish
[ah] <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut</malay>
because <malay>pulut</malay> is one dish
see if talking about dish
then
the <malay>pulut</malay> is not a <malay>makanan</malay> it's not considered [lah]
but food is life
[kan]
because food is life <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>badan kita</malay> sis
(hmm)
(hmm)
seafood
(hmm)
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
!huh! what dang
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> sis <malay>nak makan apa</malay> make up your mind
(oo) if <malay>kita boleh</malay>
choose like <malay>macam</malay>
buffet is consider
like
buffet
consider
a dish <malay>tak</malay>
like if it's a type
buffet I can eat buffet for the rest of my life [ah]
like buffet !wow!
sis
!walao!
<malay>teh tarik</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> sugar cane
!wow!
!wow! sis
but top-up how many
but <malay>dia tak ada</malay> <malay>dia tak ada</malay> limited hours you <malay>boleh duduk dekat dalam</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if you go <malay>yang kita pergi dekat</malay> #yishun# <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but <malay>yang</malay> <malay>dia</malay> dinner <malay>dia</malay> up to four hours around three and a half hours [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
maybe because <malay>dia macam</malay> on the wheel <malay>sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ</malay> like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like <malay>kenapa</malay> Seoul Garden <malay>tak boleh</malay> extend <malay>dia punya duduk dekat dalam</malay>
but what are the chances that
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] but if like <malay>pun ramai orang masuk apa</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>kita duduk sebelum dua jam</malay> [seh]
or exactly two hours then <malay>kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu</malay> full
ya
so maybe next time we can try [lah] <malay>duduk dekat dalam</malay>
for like two hours plus and <malay>tengok kena halau ke tak</malay>
what
we should we should <malay>apa</malay> what's the word [ah] bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
experiment experiment that
but the the the the only downside of
<malay>yang</malay> is because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> they should <malay>buat air dalam</malay> jug <malay>taruk dekat situ</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> Seoul Garden so it's easy <malay>pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang</malay> the person <malay>hantar air</malay>
<malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>lepas tu nanti orang tu</malay> get irritated
<malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>pasal</malay> #naan# <malay>tu</malay>
the person <malay>yang</malay> get irritated
(hmm)

the
(err) <malay>macam</malay> to to the guy <malay>macam</malay> he is in between believing <malay>macam dia dia</malay> as
<malay>dia percaya</malay> in the unseen as part of faith
<malay>tapi</malay>
cannot mix with science [what] so he's trying to do both [tau] to be like <malay>nak</malay> try to make a logic of that
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay>
but <malay>ya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but <malay>benda</malay> unseen <malay>ni</malay>
we cannot <malay>macam</malay>
and it's not of our faith to like <malay>rukun iman</malay> we have to believe in the unseen <malay>sebab tu</malay>
cannot stack means [ah] me and you together pay together cannot so I have to pay my own personally you have to pay yours personally ya [lah] it's like that [lah]
I don't know [lah] sis <malay>ingat nak pergi</malay>
<malay>yang macam</malay> sis <malay>dengar tadi yang cakap dekat situ</malay> is cheap <malay>yang ada</malay> buffet <malay>tu</malay> #halalan toyyiban#

cannot stack that is not <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> is not refundable
so that means if like if you pay seventy five you pay eighty dollars then it's not worth it [lah]
<malay>dia cuma cakap begitu</malay> [jer] <malay>apa</malay> so I think I can pay one ticket [ah]
I I will take the express one [ah]

#sabah# #sabah# got voodoo shit

it was it was two years ago [lah] but where is I think it's at #pasir ris# the the <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
D marquee D marquee
ya ya I remember it's there because [ah] I remember #hafiz# telling me that you want to go like it seems fun [lah] then I said like <malay>macam</malay> but it's scary <malay>sebab si</malay>
#jian cheng# <malay>pergi</malay> so I'm not wrong [lah]
I three I remember [ah] #jian cheng# say [lah] [ah]
<malay>macam dekat situ</malay> then [ah] <malay>dia punya bulu roma</malay> like <malay>betul-betul diri</malay>
because the <malay>keris</malay> is not a normal <malay>keris sebab keris tu</malay> is
<malay>dah</malay> fuse black magic
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[kan] <malay>tiba</malay>
was it <malay>dia tengah</malay> driving <malay>ke apa</malay> no [eh] no no no no that was in aerostar bay [eh]
[ha] <malay>engkau tak kelakar</malay> [eh] brother
it's not funny [sia] you not funny <malay>lu lu cari pasal sama wa</malay> brother
inviting
okay I have this question [ah] like for example [kan] okay when
in islam we believe right <malay>kalau kita mati</malay> our <malay>roh</malay> does not exist co-exist in this <malay>alam</malay> already so that means we are in another dimension [tau] so our dimension only <malay>macam</malay> co-exist time we sleep <malay>betul tak</malay> so like for example if <malay>kita mati kita nampak orang-orang</malay> people then if
is it the <malay>roh</malay> of the people or is it ghost or like <malay>jin</malay> in a form of people
<malay>jin</malay> or <malay>syaitan</malay> [lah] but is it
a really <malay>roh atau jin</malay> in a form of
[ah] <malay>manusia</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
for them
but
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn <malay>rumah tu semua</malay> is actually not because of to have <malay>rumah</malay> for them and others right
it's actually to show that [ah] <malay>bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita</malay> or something like that
I heard from some people like that
is it
what if like life is like that [ah] then the <malay>miskin</malay> like got <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [seh]
you just imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kita macam</malay> the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe <malay>orang dekat sana</malay>
I don't know you steal
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you <malay>macam</malay> too depressed and you <malay>tak boleh</malay> happy tu cakap</malay> you it's like a lot story in the news that people <malay>bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri</malay> because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision <malay>atau</malay>
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin <malay>apa</malay>
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin [lah] so that's why I say <malay>macam</malay>
so even if <malay>kita kita tak ada duit pun</malay> it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do [lah] <malay>kita bunuh diri kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> people
okay imagine
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money [what] you you [ah] yo <malay>hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar</malay> gets into the head <malay>dia</malay> stress <malay>sangat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
socked in the head then <malay>terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa</malay> is it happens
but we don't know [what] like <malay>macam</malay> some people depression <malay>macam</malay> too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve <malay>dia punya</malay> debts then they kill
their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing [what]
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya [lah] then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya [lah] then how to bribe
ya [lah]
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
(mm) islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own
#allah# is #allah# won't judge you once
<malay>amalan</malay>
a chance to
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim [eh] let's say [lah] even if you have a chance <malay>syurga</malay> then if you still have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay> like you never know how long you have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay>
and one other story is like <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes it it gets to me <malay>yang macam</malay> [ah]
they say the first thing that will be questioned in <malay>alam kubur</malay> or in the hereafter is <malay>solat</malay> like if
if <malay>kau</malay> the first question like <malay>solat kau tak</malay> pass <malay>yang benda lain semua tak</malay> matter already
then it gets to me [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> then some people say like some <malay>mazhab</malay> say ya you no need to pay <malay>balik yang</malay>
the <malay>solat</malay> that you missed [ah] <malay>solat</malay> just <malay>solat taubat</malay> then you just try not to do it again
but some people some <malay>mazhab</malay> say you have to pay back after every <malay>solat</malay> like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until <malay>kita mampus</malay> then I asked I asked some people [lah] let's say [kan] <malay>macam</malay> how are we going to know how many <malay>solat</malay> that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay [lah] let's say <malay>kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis</malay> that at times <malay>kita solat juga</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
repay [oh] maybe if <malay>tak</malay>
I I wanted to I wanted to ask [lah] if let's say <malay>kita</malay> because we are busy in this world [kan] kita <malay>kejar kejar kejar kejar</malay> sometimes we don't have time to <malay>qada</malay> [kan] so let's say in a sense that <malay>kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh</malay>
like let's say like <malay>aku</malay> because of the missed prayer [kan]
then sis <malay>taubat</malay> so maybe <malay>macam</malay> sis <malay>susah nak tidur malam</malay> then the only time that I can wake up is <malay>pukul tiga pagi</malay> onwards [ah]
so maybe that's the time that like <malay>macam</malay> can be it <malay>macam</malay> not <malay>ganti</malay> [lah] like can it help or not
[kan] sis <malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] let's say <malay>macam</malay> I want to be prepared <malay>macam</malay> sis want best of both world I want <malay>macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat</malay> so let's say <malay>macam kita dekat dunia macam ini</malay> [jer] <malay>macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam</malay> we are already bad <malay>dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini</malay>
<malay>kasi air</malay>
[a'ah] [lah]
ya just like the story <malay>yang yang</malay> the <malay>orang yang bunuh yang</malay> the ninety nine killer or something like that or <malay>yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> repent
<malay>dia</malay> repent <malay>dia mati dia masuk syurga</malay> because the person say no he didn't <malay>belum</malay> he haven't [tau] <malay>taubat</malay> because #allah# take his <malay>niat</malay> as <malay>orang tu cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang</malay> first the first <malay>pergi dekat</malay> first <malay>ustaz ni</malay> he went there <malay>lepas tu ustaz tu</malay> say [oh] <malay>kau tak akan diampunkan</malay> [lah] <malay>kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua</malay> something like that [lah] so he out of <malay>geram</malay> he killed the <malay>ustaz</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> kill the <malay>ustaz</malay> you know
so he went to
[ah] then he went to this another <malay>ustaz</malay> then the <malay>ustaz</malay> was saying [oh] [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak berubah</malay> if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place <malay>macam tempat yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] so he [ah] <malay>kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama</malay> something like that
no this is another <malay>ustaz</malay> so he <malay>dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap</malay> so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place <malay>dia meninggal mati</malay> so <malay>bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga</malay>
ya because <malay>niat dia</malay> because <malay>dia belum taubat lagi</malay> [tau] he <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> because he just on his way to <malay>nak taubat</malay> to get out of the place then he already get to <malay>syurga</malay> so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the <malay>niat</malay> that matters [lah]
<malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi maki</malay> [jer] [lah]
so if you want to <malay>maki</malay> just <malay>maki</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
so I so I I thought I have this conversation [lah] so
moral of the story is all based on out <malay>niat</malay> [what] so if like #allah# decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of #jannah#
good person
sinners
sinners who repent
ya [lah]
plus point
<malay>tapi tak</malay> minus
<malay>dah ada</malay> stated there
<malay>dia tulis</malay>
so #allah# is fair like that #allah# love us in a way that way [lah] I think that's how I think islam to me islam is a very loving religion [ah] a very loving very empathetic
compassion
society
first thing society [ah]
<malay>islam</malay>
ya
I hope for that <malay>ustaz</malay> also yesterday that <malay>macam</malay> he's saying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we should educate our child
that
that be modest <malay>penting</malay> is part of islam and all but <malay>kita pun kena ajar anak kita</malay> that you know doesn't mean that <malay>dia tak pakai tudung</malay> she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child <malay>macam</malay> what islam is all about since young and it starts from <malay>asar dia cakap</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tak</malay> modest <malay>dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik</malay> it's not a good thing [ah] to me personally [lah] because <malay>pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan</malay> is all <malay>masing-masing</malay>
true
I think just now [ah] flying all my <malay>tudung</malay> then <malay>macam apa ni</malay> ten
#lam soon# singapore <malay>ke tadi</malay>
my expire date is thirty first july two years after this
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [eh] what
ya [lah]
perfect
ya maybe we
<malay>kita dah pernah kena</malay> judge [lah] that's why we don't we know how it is <malay>kalau</malay> people judge us
like sis <malay>pernah kena</malay> judge <malay>masa</malay> sis <malay>kerja dekat</malay> [ah] my previous workplace <malay>yang kat</malay> #tai seng# <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] I I <malay>apa</malay> after I started <malay>pakai balik tudung</malay> right
slowly [lah] I think after that <malay>dah dua tahun</malay> [ah] but it's still slow still new [lah] then <malay>masa tu</malay> [ah] I was judged by one of the co-workers [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> then I asked why [lah] then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>baik</malay> but behind <malay>semua hisap rokok</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil laki orang</malay> [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> who are you to judge like <malay>macam</malay> just because <malay>satu orang buat kau nak</malay> judge <malay>aku macam itu</malay>
ya [lah] but it's not <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> [jer] <malay>buat apa yang tak pakai tudung</malay> also <malay>buat</malay> [what]
so why are you judging just because we wear <malay>tudung</malay> wear <malay>tudung</malay> doesn't mean <malay>yang kita ni malaikat</malay> [what]
and then sis <malay>macam tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> judge <malay>macam itu</malay>
you meet american union people start a
step <malay>baik</malay>
step good good
(hmm)
<malay>kurang ajar betul</malay>
what do you mean
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
ya [lah]
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are <malay>semua pun macam tak betul</malay> how
ya
at first sis was like sis <malay>dah jadi</malay> defensive [lah] because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends <malay>semua tak nak</malay> friend with me
because <malay>macam alim begitu</malay> [kan] she don't wan't to friend with me <malay>sebab</malay> she say [ah] <malay>kau dah pakai tudung</malay>
then <malay>buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat</malay>
then I say to her [lah] <malay>tak semestinya</malay> that I wear <malay>tudung aku baik</malay> [seh]
I wear <malay>tudung</malay> is because I wanted
to
change for <malay>agama</malay> [lah]
like sis want to change like <malay>sampai bila nak jadi macam itu</malay> maybe if I wear <malay>tudung</malay> it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to <malay>macam jaga diri</malay> in public
like sometimes <malay>kita dekat</malay> public <malay>kita</malay>
you know like <malay>macam dulu</malay> I never wear <malay>tudung</malay> then sis <malay>pakai baju</malay> low cut and <malay>nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk</malay> [tau]
our intention is not <malay>macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun</malay> but <malay>nampak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> to me it <malay>elak fitnah</malay>
[a'ah] especially especially if you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
when you wear <malay>niqab</malay> right <malay>dia punya niat</malay> is to stay away from guys right to <malay>macam</malay>
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern <malay>nya</malay> days if you wear <malay>niqab</malay> instead you attract more guys
wanted to know you wanting to know you ya because
you <malay>kau tak</malay> normal <malay>apa</malay> like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
(hmm) a lot of guys are <malay>macam itu sekarang</malay>
then because
<malay>masa yang si</malay> #nurul# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] then <malay>yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> [kan]
(err) ex #hafiz#
not the ex one [lah] the girl that she's getting to know [lah] <malay>yang dah kahwin</malay>
when she wear <malay>niqab dia nampak cantik</malay> [lah] like you will imagine her to be a <malay>cantik</malay> girl so many girls are adding her [tau]
and she received a lot of from guys [lah]
<malay>memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab</malay> she is very she is wearing <malay>niqab</malay> [what] so she delete all her pictures <malay>yang tak ada niqab</malay>
so people added her
she gains more attention by that
[ha]
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
no
no
for what
but sis don't want to be <malay>macam tu</malay> but sometimes
<malay>ada apa</malay> you know in malaysia <malay>ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> and then she's very young then <malay>macam nampak mata</malay> [jer] [kan] then she <malay>berbual</malay> very <malay>lembut</malay> very <malay>lemah lembut</malay>
[ah] then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>lemah lembut</malay> then <malay>muka kau cantik</malay>
then I when I was having this conversation with #hafiz# I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear <malay>niqab</malay> [lah] because the purpose of wearing <malay>niqab</malay> is to grown away <malay>daripada</malay> attention [what]
so if like <malay>aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku</malay> then <malay>lepas tu aku berbual</malay> <malay>begitu</malay>
because ya
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know <malay>kita dekat</malay> public [eh] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] like that
because sometimes when we wear <malay>tudung</malay> also our <malay>cara cakap</malay> also still the same [what]
so sis feel that
(hmm)
then
<malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>pakai pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>pakai niqab</malay>
you <malay>nak jaga macam mana nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes when we talk to guys like
<malay>tak tak</malay> open <malay>masuk kat masuk kat bawah</malay> [lah] <malay>tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah</malay>
I tried [what] once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say [lah] because when I see a people a girl wearing #niqab# (err) I have expectation on them [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I say <malay>macam</malay> I hear <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay> I hear <malay>dia orang macam</malay> giggle <malay>macam gedik</malay> like I don't like
[a'ah] [lah]
maybe because I have unresolved issue with <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay>
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue <malay>macam</malay>
like #neelofa# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa#
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
so <malay>macam</malay> so
people <malay>lagi macam</malay> have a better understanding of islam
so if <malay>kau</malay> react wrongly people <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>orang islam macam ini</malay> [lah]
no wonder [lah] you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief [lah] like I wanted to add [lah] that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear [ah]
then I've asked myself if I were to wear <malay>niqab</malay> then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like <malay>macam</malay> if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing #hijab# I am not wearing properly
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering [jer]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
big
big build ya
ya
then how [ah]
so sis <malay>jawab apa</malay>
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that (err)
people will judge us name like <malay>makcik-makcik</malay>
because we will be looking so dull
(mmhmm) maybe we should maybe we should start doing that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa# you know like
she change the misconception that <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>purdah mesti</malay> boring but if she change [ah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> sparkling <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> there's bling <malay>sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam</malay> okay [lah]
still
<malay>tak nampak macam makcik-makcik</malay>
what's the word [ah] the the the
ya #ringarde# I don't want to be #ringarde#
but
ya [lah]
true [lah]
and the creator
ya so like
so if you that's why they say when you <malay>pakai benda ni</malay> you are sacrificing the things that women like most
like being fashion
being looking like
<malay>cantik</malay> [lah]
ya
then remember <malay>mak</malay> saying you know like when you want to wear <malay>niqab</malay> when you want to wear <malay>purdah</malay>
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
because you are attracting people like if <malay>kau dah buat macam gitu</malay> that is
you just want to

#shiq#
like
in this life
<malay>kalau kau boleh minta tiga permintaan</malay>
<malay>untuk diri kau</malay>

<malay>kalau kau hari-hari semua benda yang kau nak kau dapat kau tak yah</malay> work for it
<malay>kau tak yah</malay> stress about it
(uh)
<malay>kau</malay> just <malay>cam apa kau nak kau dapat</malay> [ah] so like
your life is easy [ah] life is simple and like
it's always been that way <malay>sampai kau mati</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau nak hidup</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau nak hidup gitu</malay> like

[ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
as in ya [lah]
<malay>kalau kau hidup aku nak</malay> obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and <malay>kalau</malay> if <malay>semua benda yang kau nak</malay> then what's the point of living right like (uh) might but basically you were just saying like
we living in heaven [ah] <malay>dalam syurga</malay> [sia] <malay>kira kita rasa syurga</malay> [ah] <malay>terus</malay> [dah] <malay>tak payah hidup pape</malay> like <malay>kau pun percaya tuhan</malay> [pe] [kan]
so
ya that's that's that's what's up
but ya in terms
in terms of my life
it's been hard [lah] it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life [ah] as it is [ah] obviously [ah] I mean like (uh) saying it for everyone ya <malay>tapi rabak</malay> opinion <malay>kau kau cakap</malay>
<malay>semua benda kau nak dapat takmo rabak</malay> [ah]
like
okay (um)
<malay>tapi untuk kau kalau macam</malay> about like relationship with a girl
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> like
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> (uh)
what <malay>apa kau cari dalam</malay>
(uh) in a girl for you to you know
basically (uh)
<malay>perempuan idaman kau</malay> [ah]

<malay>untuk aku</malay> I think like
that's (uh) in general <malay>tu apa semua laki pun nak</malay> [lah]
but like (uh) <malay>kau</malay> try think think harder think deeper like feel like deeper like <malay>apa kau nak apa kau sebenarnya nak</malay>
(uh) <malay>dalam wanita</malay> like because let's be honest [ah] like
in life you weren't like <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat perempuan yang sempurna</malay> like <malay>tak ada orang sempurna</malay> [pe] <malay>dalam hidup ni</malay>
so <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat orang yang sempurna</malay> so like just think deep like <malay>kau rasa apa yang</malay> those some qualities that
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable [lah] like I don't think everyone would
[eh] [ah] like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that [ah] so like
think deeper [ah] just like what's like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>cam aku</malay> okay let <malay>berbual pasal aku</malay> [eh]

the last relationship I pestered her and then like maybe it's kind of like <malay>macam</malay> guilt trip <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] but
<malay>ini</malay> I just learnt like okay [lah] I cannot do anything about it [what]
so I told her like [ah] okay [lah] then I cannot do anything about it
I just want you to be happy [ah] that's
<malay>itu apa yang penting</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk aku</malay> like [ah] <malay>apa ni kebahagiaan dia</malay>

amazing [ah] so till this day she's still amazing [ah] and
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>cam</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay> just accepted how it was and how it is
and <malay>aku</malay> just wanted her to be happy
so I move on with (uh) my life and she move on with hers so she give
she give me her closure in her own way and (uh) you know
we stick out we somehow made it as a friends [ah] you know
ya so ya I guess somehow we made it as friends you could say friends [ah] till this day because we still

and then
[ah]
we were just friends time and time again I will ask about her I will ask her like how's
how it was good how it was going you know for her
and
because I truly cared for her [ah] like I could say after the break up I
even till this day I could say that
I would say I still think like about her like what she's doing like how is she is she fine
and
on occasionally as I said [ah] I would ask her [ah]
you know she also ask me like how am I doing and like
update me on some stuff
then to me it's fine [ah] I think to me what we have is
I think I believe that both of us what I believe is we both have
we like to believe that we both have moved on [ah] and I think I moved on
like in fair enough to say I moved on [ah] just that I just care about her as as some as someone
who
was special to me at one point in my life
and then (um)
[ah] <malay>apa ni</malay>
we so we just kept in contact and then I met this girl
(err) and she was also with another man
if I'm not wrong [ah]
no [ah] it was very mature [ah] for me it was mature [ah] as much as
it was a mature relationship between me and her it's not like we meet meet still meet up or what you know
(uh) it's just that sometimes we do see each other you know in school because it's the same school what so <malay>cam</malay>
[ah]
[oh] <malay>terus aku</malay> I I found this girl [ah] this other girl at

<malay>aku selalu nampak dia</malay> tweet <malay>cam</malay>
<malay>benda-benda sedih</malay> so <malay>aku cam</malay> (uh) out of the blue <malay>aku cam</malay>
<malay>aku tak nak aku nak</malay>
<malay>kesah aku tak nak tanya</malay> [ah] <malay>apa khabar</malay> like what's wrong you know <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> (uh)
<malay>kongsi pape benda</malay> then <malay>kau kongsi</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> don't mind like <malay>dengar</malay> hear it out
<malay>apa-apa dia dia ada ada dia perlu cakap</malay> [kan]
so <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku tanya dia</malay> [ah] like (uh)
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days [ah] some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone [ah] I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
[ah]
something like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>terus cam</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay>
so <malay>kita berbual berbual</malay> [lah] and then I got interested you know
[oh] [ah]
so <malay>untuk kau</malay> to be honest <malay>aku tak tahu tu</malay> too early <malay>ke tak tapi untuk kau</malay>
(uh) do you think what's what's the time limit <malay>untuk kau untuk kau</malay> move on like when do you think is the right time to move on and like
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
okay when <malay>aku aku</malay> just started out with the girl
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now (err)
I was
still in process [ah] honestly I was still in process [ah] low-key I was still in process
but
(err)
somehow I I
I move on [ah] I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is [ah] and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
(err) I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
<malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> [kan] <malay>pasal aku</malay> feel like it's a crime
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
[ah] I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
what is she up to is she okay is she fine <malay>ke</malay>
(um)
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay [ah] maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening [ah]
but it feels it feels like a crime [ah] sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having [ah] because I really love what we are having already [ah] so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good [ah]
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
<malay>cam</malay> how how it could have been a lot [ah] so I don't know if
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask [lah] like
what what what went wrong
[ah]
okay so it's like
actually <malay>betul</malay> actually <malay>betul</malay> ya ya ya ya <malay>aku faham aku faham</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> continue
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] ya ya ya you could say that [ah] but
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride [ah] I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous [ah]
my previous
girl [lah] and
to me it's fine I guess you know (uh) as you said also I think it's fine [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
to care you don't uncare for somebody <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> [pe]
so and it's okay [ah]
(um)
(mm)
but I'm still young [ah] and I I'm still very young so <malay>cam aku tak</malay>
<malay>aku tak fikir-fikir sangat macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku akan kahwin</malay> this third girl <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>tak nak fikir sangat</malay> [ah] so [dah] <malay>tiga perempuan</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku nak kena aku nak kena layan ni semua benda</malay> [kan]
so <malay>cam</malay> from my experience I'm just going out with the flow
but
doing my best as well [ah] so if it goes to where
to where I want it to be to where we both want it to be then (uh) <malay>alhamdulillah</malay>
but if not
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
but <malay>untuk kau</malay> in general your <malay>kau punya</malay> love life [kan]
like
(uh)
<malay>kalau kau</malay> explain in general <malay>kau punya</malay> love life how has it been like
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
<malay>faham faham</malay>
okay okay
<malay>aku bilang aku punya juga</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk aku apa salah</malay>
<malay>apa salah apa macam benda yang aku boleh perbaiki</malay> from like past relationships
first thing
<malay>pertamanya</malay> is
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is (uh)
you know I learnt how to accept
(err)
third thing thing is (uh) I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time [ah]
<malay>hidup dengan apa yang</malay> [dah] <malay>ada kat situ</malay> [ah]
so just live [ah] you know <malay>takmo</malay>
<malay>takmo fikir banyak sangat</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal apa akan jadi</malay> in the future
<malay>kau tahu cam</malay> just live [ah] live your life
ya <malay>gitu</malay>
(um)

<malay>abeh</malay>
[ah]
[a'ah]
ya
it's true [ah]
it makes sense [ah] cause like I mean like
it's not written anywhere [tau]
like which not written anywhere where <malay>kau ada cakap</malay> what I mean but it's an agreement between two people
but the same time if the two people have the agreement like <malay>macam kat</malay> france they have they have open relationship like I can sleep around whoever I want but at the end of the day I with you that kind of thing [kan]
but that's the funny thing like a lot of people say french people are more romantic [kan] but at the same time french people are much more open
like <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku tak boleh tidur</malay> [ah] like
<malay>aku tengok</malay> Twitter and like romanticism [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> !wah! annoying <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
like <malay>macam kau</malay> expect <malay>benda-benda merepek</malay> [tau] everything
like <malay>macam benda-benda macam merepek</malay> (oo) sweet <malay>nya</malay> sweet <malay>nya terus macam apa yang kau</malay> sweet <malay>sangat</malay> #siak#
like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] handphone <malay>tengah</malay> record <malay>kalau tak aku dah buka</malay> Twitter <malay>aku dah tunjuk</malay> all the things that
(uh huh)
[oh] that <malay>ada</malay> this girl [ah] there's this girl who <malay>ni mata air aku bilang</malay> there's this girl <malay>dia pakai tudung abeh dia nya</malay> boyfriend <malay>ada</malay> #angkong# <malay>semua</malay>
like <malay>macam tu</malay> so sweet <malay>macam</malay> she accepted him <malay>macam</malay> okay then after that like <malay>macam orang dia kata orang kat</malay> Twitter <malay>cakap gitu</malay>
<malay>terus macam</malay> (err) okay
ya
ya then after that like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
then the boyfriend keep on kissing <malay>dia punya</malay> cheeks kind of thing then <malay>macam</malay> (err) then recently [ah] the boyfriend go and message her the way he message her saying that
(um) singaporean <malay>bi</malay> I don't need sex [ah] I can wait I can live without sex
<malay>terus aku nak kata</malay> [lah] if he's not fucking you he's fucking with someone else [lah]
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa yang macam merepek</malay> [ah] like that's the thing [tau] <malay>macam bila aku dapat tahu pasal</malay> romanticism [kan]
and how we are actually romanticised by all these things that humans
<malay>ikut perasaan</malay> [tau] <malay>perangai macam lembik perangai macam kental ikut</malay> just to like <malay>macam</malay>
we believe it's such negative which actually weakens us [tau]
like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] I don't know how to explain [ah] <malay>nak kena tengok</malay> Twitter [ah] then after that <malay>aku</malay> can
really [ah] <malay>aku tunjuk aku</malay> can actually come to senses [ah] like <malay>tunjuk kau macam aku ambil</malay>
<malay>kita punya kedai</malay> handphone <malay>ada</malay> Twitter
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
<malay>takde</malay> Twitter [ah]
okay [lah]
<malay>camne</malay> [eh] <malay>nak</malay> explain
(oo) best [ah] <malay>kau kena tengok</malay> [ah] eileen the burton
eileen the burton [ah] [eh] for example [ah] the things <malay>yang dia</malay> highlight
[a'ah]
<malay>yang benda yang dia</malay> highlight is like especially <malay>macam perempuan</malay> do this <malay>padahal kita pun buat laki pun buat</malay> like <malay>macam kita padahal kita buat</malay> not only with <malay>kita</malay> partners <malay>dengan</malay> members <malay>pun sama</malay> [tau] like <malay>macam kau tak tahu</malay> [pe] <malay>aku satu minggu penat macam</malay> for example #dan# it can be as simple as #dan#
this week <malay>aku penat gila</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak boleh turun boleh</malay> that kind of thing [tau] but we expect him to understand that [eh] <malay>kau dah bodoh</malay> [pe]
<malay>aku hari-hari kerja kau masih nak lepak sini</malay> [ah] that kind of thing [ah] it's like it's as easy as bro (uh) this week I quite full [lah] cannot come to the shop or not that kind of thing
but for us we assume he know and second thing we assume that he will get offended
[ah] this kind of thing [ah] so <malay>dia kata</malay> if it's a true love or if it's true friendship if you understand each other without saying which doesn't makes sense [ah]
<malay>abeh dia kata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> we expect to do that we expect
we expect that from an adult but when it comes to baby [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>dia cerita</malay> [kan] [ah] from a real life <malay>punya</malay> experiences <malay>dia balik</malay>
one week of work
<malay>dia balik</malay> then after that (err) <malay>anak dia anak dia</malay> baby <malay>dia</malay> give <malay>anak dia</malay> some food <malay>anak dia tepis</malay> toddler [ah] <malay>nangis terus</malay>
<malay>kalau bini dia dah sepak</malay> [ah] I mean <malay>dia kata aku dah bingit gila</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan bini aku</malay> but he's my son [lah] but what I did was I try to understand him
like <malay>macam</malay> why did he why did he behave this way <malay>dia nak berak ke</malay> pampers <malay>dia ini ke dia gigi nak</malay> grow <malay>ke gini gini</malay> [ah] that's why then after that that was thinking [ah] <malay>dia kata dia macam</malay> why can't I behave
like that towards my wife as well that kind of thing [lah] cause
[ah] like <malay>macam senang cakap bila kalau</malay>
<malay>benda gini</malay> we always talk about girls [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] what's wrong nothing that kind of thing like you can just tell me
but that's the thing [ah] like but at the end of the day also most guys also <malay>dorang tak tahu</malay> how to talk about
emotions <malay>macam suami</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if they feel something <malay>diam</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> #dan# <malay>pun diam</malay> unless <malay>kita</malay> brought it up really force him to talk about it then he will talk about it
this kind of thing [ah]
ya
[ah] yes yes yes
ya
[ah]
ya
(mm)
[a'ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak ada orang ajar</malay> I mean like they
in a way <malay>lelaki</malay> [kan]
there's no
they are left on their own [ah]
that's why <malay>dorang macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tak kesah pasal</malay> for example <malay>kalau laki laki</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa-siapa nak keluar</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita punya anak sedara ke siapa</malay> [pe] <malay>bapa pun macam nak pergi mana keluar</malay> take care [eh] <malay>jangan</malay> naughty naughty [eh] <malay>perempuan nak keluar kita kongkong</malay> that kind of thing [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>laki</malay> we are just left to be everybody understand everybody have a way of thinking that guys are they can make it out there [ah] quite expected to know everything or like <malay>kau</malay> should know find for the answers
but
<malay>kita</malay> is still need a manual [pe] in some ways <malay>cuma</malay> that differentiate people [lah] like how they actually view things [ah] like some people they will <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> continue to be lost lost lost lost lost lost <malay>sampai ke mampus anak bini semua masih</malay> lost <malay>ada kalau</malay> people have gone through a lot of shit [kan] then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] things cannot happen like this [ah] I want to find something better <malay>baru dorang</malay> improve

!hais! [sial] <malay>laki ni</malay> [ha] <malay>padahal aku belum tengok dia kata laki ni</malay> [sial] I mean like [oh] okay so you have to lie now
[ah]
that's why
#dan# [ah] <malay>macam dulu</malay> #dan# <malay>macam</malay> [oh] thanks bro <malay>macam</malay> !whoa! best [pe] #dan# <malay>ada dekat sini</malay>
<malay>sekarang apa-apa</malay> #dan# <malay>buat nanti</malay> #syahmi# will find a reason to hate on it
just simple as that [ah]
<malay>pada aku ni macam</malay> a little bit romanticism in a way
[ah] this is also one [ah] shopping for a guy is so hard what do you guys like beside other girls' pictures
I mean like <malay>macam</malay>
to to a certain extent okay [lah] there are some guys who just like openly like <malay>ni semua macam</malay> that's the thing like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku tahu</malay> [sia] <malay>macam</malay> from experience I know girls
who secretly wants some guys [sial] [lah] living okay <malay>tak payah pergi jauh</malay> #adam# <malay>sendiri</malay> #siak# <malay>berapa banyak</malay> attached women go to him
talk to him and want something from him
<malay>dia macam</malay>
the fuck is that <malay>abeh kau nak</malay> come to <malay>aku</malay> like <malay>macam kau nak</malay> pure <malay>gila nak mampus</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> no I only think of you <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kau jangan bedek</malay> [ah] <malay>kita manusia</malay> [ah] [sial]
[a'ah]
that's the thing okay about romanticism [kan] okay there's
<malay>dia kata</malay> one of the things that
is quite
toxic [ah] is when you
sex and marriage sex and love intertwine so <malay>dia kata apa</malay> [tau]
when you <malay>kira</malay>
that's why there's this research [ah] woman fall in love when they hit orgasm
most most likely they fall in love when they hit orgasm
and then (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay> (err)
so they intertwine sex <malay>dengan</malay> love so if someone can treat you like good
<malay>bagus gila nak mampus</malay> [tau]
sweet <malay>tapi dia tak boleh</malay> fuck you well [ah]
<malay>kau terus</malay> down
<malay>kau macam</malay> [oh] this is not true love
or in a way [ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> how I see it [ah] like most girls [kan] <malay>bila dia dah</malay> give themselves too easy to a guy
they want to make it happen cause they don't want to make it seem that they are hoe
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
<malay>yang apa nama dia ini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> try to understand [tau]
<malay>kadang mata air aku ada sikit</malay> annoying [ah] which is <malay>aku</malay> understand <malay>pada aku</malay> like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> believe in romanticism [ah]
before <malay>dia</malay> know <malay>aku</malay> [pe] so like (err)
when you place yourself like okay you're my true love
I can only have sex with you
I mean like it's a like confirm confirm <malay>tak boleh</malay> [tau]
and like <malay>macam kalau kau buat maknanya dah</malay> end of the story that kind of thing
it's not that <malay>aku nak main orang lain</malay> or what [ah]
but it's just that when you place that [kan] so slowly <malay>kau</malay> subconsciously
<malay>kau punya</malay> mind will go lower and lower in a sense that
(err) <malay>kalau apa nama dia</malay> that mind <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>kalau kau</malay> like <malay>orang lain</malay> [kan] sexually <malay>dah kira salah kalau kau</malay> have fun <malay>kalau</malay> that time <malay>dia ada</malay> issue with <malay>aku keluar kawan aku perempuan aku dah kenal dari dulu dah lama gila</malay>
<malay>terus dia tengok</malay> story <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you look you seem more happier with her <malay>tu aku dah kenal dia berapa lama macam aku aku</malay> happy <malay>pun salah ke</malay>
that kind of thing like <malay>macam</malay> so they will like if someone can replace can if someone can give him happiness
more than me
<malay>maknanya</malay> that person is for him then <malay>macam</malay> happiness comes in different form
what she gives me
he may not give me but what you give me
is something that she cannot
give me and what you give me is something that I want [ah]
so <malay>kau jangan</malay> think it the way just cause <malay>gini abeh kau</malay> down
<malay>abeh</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia dah tak suka aku</malay> like this
overthinking [ah] [ah] but at the end of the day there there's a lot of factors that contribute to this [ah]
one she's alone overseas
<malay>takleh keluar tak ada kawan tu semua</malay> that's what overthinking is a more commonly (err)
ya happen in that situation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> all these toxic <malay>punya</malay>
toxic <malay>punya pemikiran</malay> [ah]
and like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>pada aku</malay> most of the time <malay>kita tak gaduh</malay> it's just that disagreement [jer] [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> we talk about something disagree <malay>macam</malay> #dan# <malay>dengan ni</malay>
[ah] #dan# <malay>dengan</malay> #mel#
<malay>tapi tak sampai kita merajuk</malay> it's just that <malay>aku</malay> disagree <malay>atau</malay> certain things like <malay>macam dia kata</malay> I cannot sleep [ah] <malay>terus macam asal</malay> [oh] I
don't overthink <malay>kau bilang aku</malay> [jer] <malay>asal</malay> let me talk to you [lah] like <malay>macam</malay>
ease your mind <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku boleh buat dia cakap tak nak nanti menyusahkan kau</malay>
<malay>abeh terus nanti kalau dah bilang</malay> then after that <malay>dia</malay> come to conclusion that <malay>dia</malay> overthinking <malay>abeh dia ingat macam</malay>
[oh] <malay>aku selalu buat orang susah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku selalu macam kita kena gaduh pada aku ni tak gaduh</malay>
<malay>ini bukan gaduh</malay> it's just us communicating [jer]

and you are offended
I don't know what else to talk about
<malay>tadi korang cakap berbual pasal</malay> happiness <malay>pun macam</malay>

that [one] I don't care [lah] like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me <malay>ke buang</malay> (uh) me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done [lah] and <malay>dia pangkat</malay> sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant <malay>punya</malay> rank [lah] so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did <malay>buang</malay> so whatever he did to me he will get back [lah] ya
we are basically like the black people
no seriously like white always have the privilege I mean guys always have the privilege
(mm) that [one] is damn sad [lah]
I can't really say much but ya whatever it is like try me whatever happens happens [lah] because I know how to save myself but then we see how it goes [lah] who knows things change we don't know but like I can just be brave that's what I can do I just ya put my mind into him
like because like I feel like I'm talking to you like you know just don't make anything bad happen to me okay
I don't know the way that is not like (err) being like disrespectful disrespecting [lah] I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> cause he's the one that create us [what] so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with #allah# like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like <malay>bukan macam</malay> [eh] <malay>lu macam muak</malay> no
that's exactly ya that is like <malay>ya allah tolong</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>buat macam gini</malay> you know like please [lah] please [lah] at least that [one] he knows <malay>macam</malay> because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>berbual maki ya allah</malay> you know that
kind of disrespecting ya but then no [lah] so far I never do that before I'm like always like you know I'm always very comfortable
[oh] my god
I don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
I think because they watch a lot of nuns [lah] how is it scary we are [oh] my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand [lah] they don't have to also
if not just ask us [lah] about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay [lah] explain us about good I explained ask about your god
just because we look scary !wow!
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those <malay>hijab</malay> people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear <malay>hijab</malay> and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant #blah# #blah# #blah# no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like like that
like all those wannabes
same <malay>sama</malay> ya true true
(mmhmm) like not like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect <malay>memang betul kita semua bukan</malay> perfect <malay>pun</malay>
so is like something is even <malay>orang yang</malay> very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes <malay>kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam</malay> [oh] !wow! <malay>kita aku rasa aku betul</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi orang lain tengok macam</malay> [eh] actually <malay>dia ni apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia buat</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>salah</malay> [sia] <malay>padahal sendiri fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>baik baik baik</malay>
<malay>tapi nanti bila dah</malay> live a long life already <malay>fikir balik macam</malay> like [oh] my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that [lah] like so <malay>sekarang</malay> for the <malay>mak</malay> and <malay>minah</malay> I feel sorry for them [ah] because they maybe <malay>tak dia kurang ajar</malay>
<malay>pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar</malay> so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a <malay>minah</malay> and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a <malay>minah</malay>
I can be any anyone [lah] like can just say I'm a girl with a lot of personalities
I can be a <malay>minah</malay> I can be a #mat# I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and #allah# give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to <malay>macam</malay> you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes <malay>kita tak macam</malay> we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but <malay>padahal macam pada kita</malay> is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to <malay>macam</malay> sugarcoat everything <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you are doing so great [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai hijab tak tutup</malay> (err) <malay>apa apa ni leher takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>lupa melayu sikit takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tak tutup pun takpe</malay> [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai tudung dengan</malay> sleeveless <malay>pun tak apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau nak main bola pakai tudung</malay>
never heard of that but ya like <malay>semalam dah cakap</malay> [ah] it's like okay that kind of <malay>teguran</malay> is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like !wow!
[eh] example like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! #farah# so nice [ah] she everytime sugarcoat me ya but <malay>padahal</malay> #farah# itself is like
like I don't really mean that you know like I I'm just trying to sugar coat you because I want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference
exactly (uh) like seriously I feel so <malay>malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri</malay>

<malay>azam baru dengan</malay> veganism
(mm) (mm)
(mm) <malay>mungkin dalam</malay>
<malay>dalam masa</malay>
<malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> depend <malay>juga</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> have <malay>ada</malay> deteriorate <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>atau</malay>
(mm)
<malay>atau ada apa-apa yang mengubah persepsi dalam</malay> morality
depends [lah] you <malay>rasa macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi macam ada</malay> standpoint morality
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay>
opinion
[oh] <malay>sebab tu rasa</malay> selfish [ah]
(mm) <malay>itu dia panggil</malay> cognitive dissonance (err) basically
<malay>bila</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat</malay> certain <malay>negara</malay>
some of them
<malay>ada yang makan anjing</malay>
you <malay>boleh tengok dekat</malay> YouTube
<malay>ada yang</malay>
<malay>yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia</malay> [kan] <malay>makan makanan</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kat situ kelakar</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita boleh nampak</malay> dislike <malay>pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan</malay> steak <malay>biasa</malay>
beef
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] like <malay>lepas tu korang</malay> comments <malay>semua yang elok-elok</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap sedap</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang</malay> dislike then <malay>bagi</malay> comment
<malay>yang marah</malay> [lah] <malay>marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak</malay>
hypocrite [kan] (mm)
(mm) <malay>sebenarnya tu memang</malay> argument <malay>yang orang selalu pakai</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi dekat situ timbul satu</malay> problem <malay>macam mana</malay> intelligence <malay>satu</malay> sentient being <malay>diukur macam mana dia orang</malay> measure
so <malay>dah jadi satu</malay> problem <malay>kat situ</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>rasa</malay> (mm) morally <malay>memang kita salah</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau nak ikut daripada</malay> standpoint moral
<malay>cuma</malay>
I <malay>suka juga tengok daripada satu</malay>
<malay>daripada satu</malay> (uh)
evolutionary standpoint <malay>yang mana</malay>
<malay>kita dah dah</malay> mutated <malay>dah</malay> evolved
<malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk makan</malay>
sentient being <malay>lain</malay> though so <malay>dah</malay> in a way <malay>dah</malay> adapt <malay>sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan</malay>
<malay>tinggalkan</malay>
(mm) tradition <malay>bukan</malay> tradition <malay>tinggalkan</malay> diet <malay>tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab banyak juga</malay>
<malay>orang-orang yang</malay> ex-vegan <malay>yang dah</malay>
ten years being vegan
last <malay>sekali dia orang</malay>
<malay>dia orang tinggalkan juga</malay> veganism <malay>sebab</malay>
health <malay>semakin teruk</malay> [kan]
(mm)
[ah] in fact <malay>baru</malay> five thousand years <malay>dari</malay> ya <malay>yang yang</malay> recorded [lah] five thousand years <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] agriculture
before that <malay>takde yang dikenal pasti</malay> [lah]
<malay>itu masa</malay> mesopotamia [kan]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> I <malay>akan</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> vegetarian <malay>dulu sebab macam biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan</malay> cheese
<malay>telur</malay> yes yes <malay>tak boleh</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
last <malay>kita makan</malay> beef <malay>pun bila</malay>
mac D [lah]
[a'ah] [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>tapi kita</malay> [kan] <malay>pernah</malay> discuss <malay>sebelum ni kalau macam susah</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam</malay> health issue <malay>macam ada</malay> allergy <malay>ke makan makan</malay> meat products
<malay>ada</malay> allergy <malay>jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> illness [ah] <malay>ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh</malay>
<malay>makan daging</malay>
[oh] ya [lah] <malay>rasa serba salah rasa</malay> guilty <malay>dia dah masak</malay> [kan]
I was many <malay>tak tahu pun</malay>
just just <malay>fikir bila dah tengok banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak</malay> debate
then <malay>dia macam dia</malay> start to make sense [lah] <malay>bila</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay>
discussion <malay>pasal</malay> morality issues
(mm) back then I consider <malay>juga</malay> standpoint <malay>yang lagi satu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang memang</malay>
<malay>kalau ikutkan daripada</malay> organism <malay>yang pertama pun memang dia</malay>
<malay>menelan satu sama lain agaknya</malay>
even plants <malay>pun</malay> evolve <malay>daripada</malay> organism <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> first
(mm)
mostly <malay>pasal</malay> philosophy <malay>yang mana yang mana</malay> start
start into into <malay>betul pun lepas</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay>
start pandemic
and <malay>jadi banyak masa untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> reflect
<malay>untuk fikir</malay> (err) meaning of life
and then <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] (err)
<malay>macam-macam</malay>
argument <malay>macam-macam</malay> discussion <malay>dapat</malay>
<malay>dapat tengok sebab</malay> free <malay>sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak</malay> free time <malay>masa</malay> pandemic <malay>ni</malay>
so <malay>daripada situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni</malay>
<malay>macam dulu tak boleh dengar pun sebenarnya bila orang</malay>
<malay>bincangkan pasal</malay> veganism
<malay>dia macam selalu</malay> irritating [kan] annoying <malay>macam mana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (err) recently [lah] <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>nampak</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> make sense
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya [lah] source of protein <malay>tu senang nak dapat</malay> ya especially is <malay>buat tempeh</malay> [lah]

alright [jer] (mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> still once in a while <malay>memang rasa</malay> craving <malay>untuk</malay>
(err) beef too especially <malay>bila bayangkan</malay> steak
(um) <malay>yang</malay> medium rare [ah]
<malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>kat situ</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi</malay> problem <malay>tu dia kita ni</malay>
<malay>bunuh</malay> other sentient being <malay>untuk bagi</malay> pleasure <malay>pada</malay> taste bud <malay>kita</malay> (mm) <malay>ada juga orang yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> counter <malay>balik dia cakap</malay> okay and then <malay>macam mana</malay> handling <malay>dengan nyamuk macam mana dengan</malay> (err) <malay>lipas</malay>
<malay>takkan kita tak boleh nak bunuh</malay> [kan]
(err) <malay>dekat situ itu persoalan yang lain</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia orang</malay> invasive <malay>macam lipas nyamuk ni</malay> invasive so <malay>dia bukan macam</malay>
(err) <malay>lembu lembu kita</malay> factory farm and then <malay>kita bagi dia</malay> life <malay>yang teruk</malay> just for the sake <malay>untuk dapatkan</malay>
product just for the sake <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk makan dia</malay>
[ah] [ha] <malay>sebab lembu tu dia tak pernah kacau orang pun dia tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>masuk rumah</malay> and then <malay>hisap darah ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tapi pun ada juga yang yang</malay> certain vegan <malay>yang memang sampai</malay> to the extremes <malay>dia orang tak bunuh nyamuk</malay> they just <malay>tiup</malay> [jer] a lot <malay>macam tu jadi</malay> [ah] <malay>yang tu</malay> extreme <malay>sangat</malay> #kot#
(mm)
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kalau</malay> creature <malay>lain</malay> human <malay>ke</malay> animal <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kalau dia</malay> start <malay>untuk</malay> invade <malay>tu kita ada</malay> right <malay>untuk ni</malay> [lah] self-defence [lah]
<malay>anjing ke kalau dia kejar</malay> [ah] <malay>kita boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>baling batu ke</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau dia tak kacau</malay>

<malay>apa-apakan dia</malay> [lah]
(mm)
<malay>ada tapi macam tak nampak</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam nak belajar</malay> serious <malay>pasal</malay> philosophy
