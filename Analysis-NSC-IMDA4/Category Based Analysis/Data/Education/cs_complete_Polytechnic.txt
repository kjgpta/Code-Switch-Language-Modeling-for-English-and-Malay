apa you belajar kat sana
then which one which one your most favourite ah mana satu
my course ah my course is uh also known as apa uh marine engineering
like dia macam um okay so basically
like my job progression kan lepas
err apa err diploma kan is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu ah
okay for third year aku rasa uh aku what ah
so like um for me I I pick the shipyard job ah because I heard of like very good like uh what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing ah because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing uh bila kau sail kan uh macam
enam months like that
six month gitu ah away from your families lah which I don't think I personally think I cannot ah you know
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to ah like in in the future ah gitu
then also apa eh okay um apa dia eh oh okay
but like I planning to ah so now apa eh uh my first year kan ah I only got to like try out the different ah so like we all can like
apa choose ah the various types of sports or
kat sekolah we you can choose ah so I for the for me I pick the apa floorball lah like something new lah for me like I never try before ah
apa eh uh
quite fun ah you know enjoyable your ah kawan kawan you know quite fun ah
apa sport I prefer
ah apa eh okay got offer quite a few sport ah
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but I I don't know ah for poly I maybe won't pick like apa eh
uh clubs as in macam
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then macam
I was planning to join ah in the first year tapi
apa eh uh tak dapat like you must go for apa
like I talk banyak tau
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I tak dapat you know
but hopefully if I tried apply again dapat ah
like for your course other than like programming gitu
for me personally kan uh I enjoy the apa workshop ah not for like year one
because I apa secondary school I pilih ah what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology ah
so like for me is uh is fun lah cause it's actually something new ah some s- some of the what uh workshop practice or something you like welding uh you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding ah something new ah then I macam lepak lepak you know
but err on workshop cause I workshop ah aku rasa macam four hours ah gitu
then okay for my course right uh they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like uh different kind of apa eh dia punya skills ah
err apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
if you just go for interview eh no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa eh uh internship when you go for internship err what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
uh purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right err you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test ah it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
if I'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me ah cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
ape benda like other things I do other than in school lah
kay for me right apa eh uh in my free time I like to game you know
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right uh I start off with mobile gaming ah then I started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene ah
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two ah then the prizes macam uh gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
ya so you obviously ada experience kan
mm can lah you just you just go for it ah dulu
ah okay lah because like semalam I got study like the whole night you know like macam two
at three gitu I went for an appointment ah
how should I say macam
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say apa eh uh it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation ah so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like apa eh
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk oi all queuing up lah
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
apa eh
you suka apa
uh do like apa small business eh is it is that what you do
ah ya calligraphy business when uh like apa notebook ah
what do I normally do kat rumah eh
the apa uh apa airports cover business obviously not bad ah the business the profits ah ya
like the apa the Paris Disneyland
ya aduh
but but then macam there would definitely be still restriction lah you know like beach maximum capacity
but then again if like apa dia punya deadline is like
I don't do right then my will be affected apa
ah apa our school work ah ya
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course ada tak
like for this semester one kan uh I have this uh project called the module name is which is apa eh uh
so like uh we all macam is
uh two from then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa uh
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like uh it was during uh hari raya haji right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to uh help them with something and present then when I tell them macam I say I cannot ah I like damn busy today I got my
they should know the different type of apa
err the type of programs dia punya different types of software ah to do like animation ke
tapi kan I tell you ah these guys kan is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
is to help people with depression you know so like apa eh uh we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
more with macam err people ah online people online ah like strangers you know not in not strangers lah
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing ah like apa the apa the
then our app also ada you have err what ah you have the therapy consultation tab
since our app is based on uh like I said the apa eh the macam Pokemon kan like the virtual pet right
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins ah basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what I decide to do ah
so like the shop right we also have a shop ah the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put err like the what ah poke food poke food includes like the apa
cause like usually my what when I go for interviews I rarely aku macam uh rarely know what to say ah
kirakan oh K K

we all have to uh macam go back to you know to kasi balik the coins

I think humaira did but then she just tutup balik but then like humaira tanya aku eh humaira told me macam eh macam mana dia kasi aku letter sia dia suruh kasi kau then I told her aku tak nak aku cakap dengan dia tak payah kasi aku then after that she apa ni she insist she kasi juga she give it to me then aku buka aku baca then aku macam you know lah I like you lah whatever then after that aku nampak rushaidi was like hiding and looking
then then pastu aku nampak dia tengah tengok aku sengaja aku koyakkan kan then aku buang dalam rubbish bin
dia tengok dia macam dia tengok dia dah terkejut tau and he was shocked lah then after that he uh but after that he still continue to like me and you know he whenever I say like uh where's my block my teacher ask where's your block all abeh he will story to the class dia akan cakap his house is behind my block abeh dia cakap something then teacher ask which school do you wanna go then I say xingnan then he also say xingnan

oh I saw kau ambil gambar lah
ya you look the same tapi but ada lah nampak difference
kat kindergarten
kau pun sama perangai macam eh
sekarang apa dah okay
but dia tak tahu eh
dia tak ingat he didn't even remember that
ya any stories dari primary school you went to which primary school
why korang never just start your name with like arina and diana
ya so sekarang orang panggil kau arina kan
oh ya abeh dia takyah surgery
kurang ajar sia tu
apa nak cakap like you grow out of this
ya last time I was okay cute then after that suddenly the you know period eh period pula sekali the maturing phase I oh my god I just look so oof but okay lah at least now I look better
ya but it was so funny was so funny literally funny gila
nice ke
sekolah kita is just not creative
primary five right starting of primary five I like this guy so much then I was I already prepared I rehearse kat rumah you know I rehearse how do I tell this guy then then I talk to the wall all this like pretending like that guy is the guy ah then after that sekali I met him in real life that time was Mendaki so Mendaki class then I told him ah I like him right then he reject me sia
you don't know who but her name was zulaikha I told her macam eh I like this guy sia then she she encourage me to confess to the guy you know I confess to the guy right then after that tak jadi then I told her semua then the guy cakap like he not ready all this then after that she like she cheer me up all this right end up you guess what two weeks later she got together with the guy
you gave me encouragement and all then suddenly kau yang get together with the guy
oh my god dia dah pergi dengan amira is it
see kalau she want to lie to you kan what is this
petty sia kau
zennis yang kawan dia iman tu she's muslim right
oh then kat luar it's already the swimming pool
oh she wear jubah
wait but right dia is she like religious
eh diam lah
buta sia
then after that why you all sit together dekat-dekat
but I actually want to know right how how you found the motivation to wear hijab like fully like what makes you
apa eh yang safi saw in this guy
okay wait I actually know the story okay tapi you just story I remember I remember the story
I can see that he's very introverted you know it's like very maacam senyap from his photo also I can see he he's a very senyap kind
tak macam how how you feel like okay uh from the start eh like when you just know him
have you ask afiq whether did he like really wanted to find a hijabi girl or
then how how you feel like eh boleh if I if the guy like macam afiq eh he talk to me like that he tak jaga my hati right I straightforward nah this is not the guy then I will just like stop it how how did you just continue
tak tahu ah I just I think my heart just not open yet you know okay sekarang ni orang kau nampak yang selalu marry kan you see like mira filzah also she marry someone she met a few times only
see sekali aku like twenty plus then I met someone yang macam betul-betul like god open my eyes
she can like him not for his looks cause he's more I saw his post kan he's more of those macam work kind of guy
that kind of guy the more pandai kind of person I rather more fun kind of person than
macam aku rasa boring though
itu ah macam I thought if mira with zizan right zizan is like he he's fun and entertaining what he don't have looks I don't mind sia
they say like charli you can just post anything what and people will just like it what she can just post a picture of her stoning and she can get millions of like gitu-gitu dah ya
abeh yang the bella that one she just
no lah you very kaku sia in front of
jom ah jadi agent rumah
exactly the rich yang tak perlu they get more stuff than the people who need need cause they want promote their products obviously can make this kind of people
eh not bad sia my only drop to two point something I think ni will drop some more
dia dah dia dah twenty one he start at nineteen
twenty habis itu twenty dia twenty one eh twenty
habis poly
then after that he have to go so I think twenty one dia enlist or twenty
let's say pergi twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty three dia akan keluar twenty three baru keluar
itu pun kalau dia straightaway like okay after this I do this after this kalau dia macam nak stop sekejap nak kerja
no cause that one is right I think is kalau I don't know ah I think because I oh is masters masters then you need that one to two years of working experience
bachelor is before ni kan before degree right
you should join before before poly my friend dah masuk NAFA now
so if I'm not wrong damn expensive though but kena kerja one year
he singaporean also he have to kerja one year and tak pergi sekolah for one month
tak tau dia kata tak dapat then he work starbucks for one year baru work
tak tahu lah dia suka ah dia suka
some more mak dia tak nak bayarkan he have to pay himself
abeh yang she study and she's good at it also it's good lah because like if you have uni you have uni like you have a degree then after that you will have higher pay enter only will have higher pay if not you're let's say if you enter with a diploma then your gaji is two point five then if you enter with a degree your gaji is three point five something like that
ya if not if you enter with a diploma and then you have to slowly work up you know macam two point five abeh maybe after two years later your boss naikkan gaji two point seven two point eight I don't know
so is kalau I just stop at diploma I can make like three point two ah if I go for a hospital
so they add up together dah seven K seven K is enough
bagus ah
but like I think for comfortable life macam betul-betul comfortable you don't need to think about financial issues right minimum five K I think
uh no it's the same uh like food but then another another shop so like she buka same shop
mana lah aku tahu kan
like I tried lah like my mum own cooking at home sedap ah takkan aku nak cakap mak aku masak tak sedap
ya then she learn she learn from like internet facebook all this I don't for she interested in this kind of thing eh like kitchen I am not at all then she ask me to help aku macam I don't like lah this kind of thing then after that she ask my sister itu semua untuk buka this kind of shop
ya you know yang kedai yang ni she actually wanted to
oh ya you actually wanted to tutup the shop and open because she want to open another shop but then end up she think back pasal her her work workers macam tak bagus her workers like take advantage like she pay her worker like seventy dollars per day
ya it's just like that I mean dia punya pekerja like the food standard is always macam tak constant sekejap sedap sekejap tak sedap that kind
my mum pay monthly four K orang semua terkejut sia
dorang macam how you make money here then mak aku macam uh cause my mum she smart lah in business she smart in business she just put everything macam orang nak taruk barang tu semua kan then they just tell people then she just put on her barang
so she just take everything and just put macam no matter benda tu orang nak ke tak just put lah like kalau orang nak beli
tapi because the shop is too expensive per four K per month then I tell my mum takyah lah tutup ah kedai ni mahal sia
like if let's say if you find another shop like one K plus then that three K can be yours then can add up to your three K can be six K already you earn then this one you pay four K to them just like that I mean bill kena bayar sendiri
bil api air semua kena bayar sendiri then aircon dalam tu macam rosak gitu so cannot feel
ya uh tak dia repair but you know the thing is kita tak ada aircon ah the aircon macam tak boleh rasa then abeh you have still have to pay for the aircon shit
pastu engine dia keep trip ah macam dia punya mak aku my mum say can only open like two switches at a time abeh macam mana nak masak cepat-cepat like two switch at a time kalau nak panaskan it's like very lambat kan
abeh lepas tu then they they thing keep trip the whole thing just trip kan tak ada lampu for like thirty minutes tak ada lampu tau then the person will scold us say I tell already right you can open two two switch
what the hell two switch abeh dah lah mahal abeh kau cakap buka two switch
merepek kan then mak aku dah aku cakap dengan mak aku tutup jer ah kedai ni then after that my mum macam sedih ah to leave the kedai seh like like the kedai then after that my dad already dah tukarkan the wire the whole wire because you know last time can open two switch now my dad dah tukar we can open all the switch already then it won't trip bapa aku cakap they use the wire yang lousy the wire like literally the cheapest wire
ya that's why kau buka tu switch jer dah trip
exactly abeh lepas tu bapa bapa aku yang buat sia semua yang the whole wire then he do by himself then like you know my mum already put in a lot lah for that shop abeh dia sedih nak tutup the shop then after that when we ask her to tutup she like tak nak ah then she say you know what if I continue to just open the shop then at least she say monthly she can still get three K what she open another shop then she can earn more what because she's interested you know this food food shit ah aku tak aku tak interested
jom ah kita buka sama-sama kau masak aku
right right kalau kita buka together then you can cook then I will be the server
kita how about we do western food and not
malay nasi
kita taruk mi rebus plus fish and chips
or like put like chilli crab punya sauce right
or we put um kuah mi soto
ya I can see you your love for soto ayam
that soto ayam
murah seh
malay food I like you know yang nasi rawan but that was so that is so good uh uh
but it's like at pioneer point I don't know I think can sit there and eat but then kedai dia selalu tutup my father always go saturday tutup sunday tutup then my father macam apa ni business macam mana nak buka ni kalau
pasal dulu it never close you know
mahal kedai tu is like you know that time they asking from sara for twelve K a month
ya sara says sara told me last time I was close to her juga what last time
yup because at first it was at four K plus after that they saw macam sara punya kedai always banyak banyak queue then long queue every time then the person keep increasing macam you are trying to benefit from people punya business
kedai lain semua dah tak naik tank
is cannot what cause that is the person's shop what kalau kau it's either you stay or leave ah gitu if the person say okay if you don't want pay then you leave ah
you imagine eh kalau kedai sekarang ni yang that twelve K a month you think they can earn or not after that
and like apa the shop obviously the shop owner dia sengaja nak sara punya father keluar that's why naikkan tinggi-tinggi nanti sara father cannot pay then surrender the shop
kedai tu ah
tu jer that's all you know
cause they always keluar gi malaysia all this together
now dorang ni ke
is either at home biasanya dorang masak kat rumah then they send to the shop
ya ya that's why maybe they busy ke dorang both at the shop
sekarang bapa dia bawa grab pe
should be business tak cukup or like they have a lot of things to pay ah pasal dulu kan the business very good
then after that sekarang dah tak bagus then the father ambil car abeh ambil motor berapa banyak biji motor dia nak then the father buy for the kakak the abang pun all motor abeh sekarang business dah tak bagus how then he have to grab ah bawa grab pay for all this thing because obviously all these you haven't pay finish what
kena bayar so it's either untuk aku your if I am the father I will surrender the motor then just use the car
abeh nak bayar banyak-banyak how to afford
tak lah aku tak boleh ah
kau berani naik motor macam nasib kau afiq ada motor kan nanti dia
abeh takkan kau nak bilang mak kau kan safi nak naik motor dengan
dulu aku naik motor dengan aku punya kawan lelaki semua mak aku aku rasa mak aku tak tahu at all sia
tapi actually aku pun takut aku macam dah fikir macam kalau aku jatuh ni eh kalau ayah aku tahu mampus sia
it's not like it's not the guy's fault what you also want you also want to naik
the situation sekarang COVID
ya because got crowd control so ada banyak-banyak timing so
tengok timing lah selalu kalau timing jam satu gitu lepas lunch ah
banyak orang because they all rush in
ya ah then especially kalau pakai mask kan ah tu lah
ah kan ya then I don't know I feel I feel like I a bit rude but at the same time is just takpe lah eh orang pekak so biarkan jer
ah ah seh just to ah kalau pergi shopping mall pun susah kan walaupun nak beli like one thing only like bubble tea
kan kan like um so sometimes like we just want to minum air and then like people just suddenly stare at you like chill I just I just drinking water
orang pakai mask but never cover the nose like
ah kenapa
eh apa dia buat
mmhmm and then apa
basically okay lah dua macam dua alam like malay call it dua alam
I tried going on dating apps ah you know ya ya ya Tinder Muzmatch ya especially that so bila I kat sana then
it's just the way that they text the way that they reply sometimes I don't like you know sometimes like the way they spell certain stuff you know like you can just say it to me in like one long sentence but you have to kasi short form macam
uh they are actually quite hype they they they boleh berbual ah everything but
you know what I I don't really like you know talking to you you know like just ugh very cringe but it's just you know sadly some some of them are actually nice it's just suka it's just a preference
so ya talking about that tu pun
can still use your picture obviously because if not it will be catfish lah technically kalau
right so so macam kat Telegram or what then you send the video message thing at least they know like ah okay this person is this face but the name
lain lah but tu jer maybe your age lain sikit maybe your birthday lain sikit
okay maybe one of us who are like twenty one years old nak berbual dengan dorang then tiba-tiba I don't know kena
I don't know she was a minor because she never put in her bio or something and then who's fault is it you whose one handcuffs ah you you kena
you kena what house arrest ah that one
you kena the watch on the
I think maybe to a certain extent boleh macam
macam orang yang buat macam gini just to be like a predator or something that one is a no no
okay ah so hari ni makan apa tadi tadi makan apa
ah lah takpe sama I had the Nissin seafood one very nice
seven eleven one ah ah okay lah not bad sedap juga
eh apa nama dia
dulu bila kat sekolah it's just um
I had a crush on this girl so biasa lah eh like cinta monyet everything and then just macam oh my god secondary school ada mata air baru
and then ada lah kawan ni from primary school
and then uh well I have it's just like you like I had a sus feeling you know like the vibes and everything so so okay but I still ignore lah cause I thought like mana tahu secondary school it's a different ah ya ya ya like even though it's like primary six to sec one
dah mature a bit lah ah
I was talking to the guy on the phone and everything I selalu bawa dia ajak dia into the conference call like that because okay lah me being you know seeing her as my
best friend at that point of time macam
you know I want to include you and everything I do so like I tak malu lah ya so but then it's just the the stupid thing is that um
before before that night a few days before the dude and I dah confess so so we we okay lah we say that oh I like I like you too and everything it's cute but then the thing is we confess at playground with letters we roll each other letters you know ya right it's not over over text like I I state my no lah
so on the night we were talking and everything then I ask him lah like do you do you want to go to the next level gitu biasa lah eh you know I dah desperate kan so and then he like ah boleh jer like I okay because I suka you and everything and I'm like aww okay apa-apa jer lah so as long as you and I together
cinta monyet I just said it
ya but for us we don't use puppy we use monyet so monyet because it's ya it's playful basically because we
we see monkeys as very playful so like that lah but I feel like kalau puppy love is quite cute
where was I ah so during the phone call and then we were talking like that and then my best friend was there then dia dengar jer lah so she just like okay tak tak kepoh lah because I ajak so it's fine macam member sunyi
the whole school his whole cohort dapat tahu that
ya I mean that's how much I sayang her as a friend lah that I the first person that I look to is my ex that time so and then he was like takde ah takde cakap apa-apa like you think I that kind of person to share and like that then I was like okay lah mana tahu
after that we I just like okay lah takpe I lupakan jer and then
yang perempuan tu suka dia juga so ya hmm tak player is he he's just never been in a relationship before except except for with me
apa lagi eh so lepas tu
the girl that used to like my ex uh before my ex and I got together she she hated me lah cause I so called aku rampas dia punya
ya then aku macam
bro you you never make your first move how how is it my fault precisely how is it my fault also ya sure korang suka each other but if if I like him and then somehow he fell for me also and then okay lah then that means I I put in effort what and unlike you you just you just like you see from afar and just like hi then for me it's just like
ah padahal dorang ke apa okay no hate lah sia no hate but it's just
not spending time I prefer befriending ya I forgot the word befriending dengan lelaki and everything because they very chill sure you need to find the balance between the guy friends lah
because tak buang waktu sia like kau
kau penat-penat kau berbual dengan dorang kau lepak dengan dorang and then setakat they just like eh your friend single or not then like what the fuck bro
sikit jer ke banyak ni
deserves maybe you guys never you never end it off properly macam tak sedap
itu not
steep cut but kau tak cakap apa-apa then why why would he
I I tadi marah because ada orang terlanggar you know then like your girlfriend will just rely a'ah I faham faham but if you tell a guy is just like
setakat dia cuma langgar jer pe ah like that wait maybe maybe I can say we are too sensitive or kita overreact but
hmm tu lah get out but I got this story back when I was in I had this classmate she was very clingy gitu macam dia
dia dia tak ada banyak kawan lah because dia pendiam then bila orang
sama-sama but for her it's just how to say ah
setakat aku nak kawan dengan semua orang dalam class so
kalau apa-apa nak berbual it's okay lah like rather than you just have beef with everyone like for what and then
lepas tu she became clingy then mana-mana aku pergi dia nak ikut then it's like ah dia dia perangai macam lelaki like she insecure lah because she she's afraid of people abandoning her so when I talk to other classmates she will just like
eh asal kau berbual dengan dia sia then aku macam
biar ah aku nak berbual dengan siapa and then it's like and then it's like ada ah project and everything so for project work
I had to choose ah I was given finally given the chance to choose my own group because dulu is dorang main ambil jer lah which
which was sad because I had those free loaders and everything and lepas tu I didn't pick her because she herself was the free loader
but she she she never realise because sebagai kawan I never tegur because out of kesian right you know like it's your own friend you sayang your friend and everything
and then she she text me she sound me and everything she say why why you never pick me for your group and then aku cakap
oh ah aku tak pick pun dorang yang pick aku
I bohong ah because I don't want her to get hurt but in the end she did and then in the end she found out lah ya and then she
and then bila tengah buat project then she will complain like uh you know akunya group macam gini macam gitu then
but that one I feel like for everyone is normal you know if everyone if everyone if someone just overly control you you would just feel tak sedap hati macam apa sia aku buat aku dengan kau siapa sia kawan jer
okay lah just share share sikit leh dengan
lepak bawah blok eh ah
okay that's cute I guess macam abang-abang ah gitu kan abang-abang yang bulat ah um ah betul betul betul
oh sombong eh ah oh ya that's true
cakap jer lah
so cili padi is like small and feisty and spicy
member kucing ke robot pun tak tahu
ah so the youngest all the very degil-degil bukan ke oh shit

so dia dia tinggal kat rumah atau
kenapa kau yang jumpa atau your family members your other family members oh
anak derhaka ni lu dengar eh dengar eh
wow that's cute um alah cute nya tak payah beli bantal ada kucing
ah so that's why you call cili padi
macam especially
ya it's just it's just ayam masak ya that's true
hey lah how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no I think kita tak jumpa for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right err last year when do you remember bila dia start
COVID bulan sebelas COVID bulan
okay COVID november ya so I I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
early last year you know what what I can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
err my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that eh
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
lah you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah kan
err from my memory is that we went for apa tau performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
err we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of err shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
mm mak long
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku I remembered that ah kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends eh yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat err bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then I remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's sriwana yes yes you see now it's all coming back
yes I think kita orang were quite active in performance because I remember um quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
engkau ada topeng lah but I do not have a topeng so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because lembu kan ada horns right so I need to be a lembu with horns so what I did was during the song of um old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
you were a duck I remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be err not confirm just to be sure lah kan kita orang ni iya lah kan
err I remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa lah you were happy confidently you know yes
err you were itik okay so
lupa ah so err the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some lah community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa ah
ya ya ya we all so it was it was actually quite err at that point of time I did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I I I remembered that err we were doing good stuff lah which we did not know was good at that time
ya err aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
okay cool cool but I remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like oh so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni kan it was very it was because it happened by mm ya so I'm not sure okay so your
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so I was err you know I got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam eh hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these lah and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
maybe dia bingit ya I mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know err I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau jer that was a memory ah ya your turn
I remember those moments of education yang aku tak
really oh that was so sweet of you aku feel so err yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
engkau bukan seorang ya
oh I remember I know where you're going with this I aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
ya I I I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time kan you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil tau tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
I I I I try to describe it ah so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok ah
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak kan
it oh ya yup yup near our house ah ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block farhan if you remember correctly
salah brother love
john J A B C D E F G H aku pun tak tahu
ya I aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alphabetically just to try and eh he looks like a john you know oh ya ya he is a john so we I I go through that thing also I believe apa tau lah like they did err they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa tau siapa yang dulu um buat show dengan mak long gitu
mm siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan sriwana so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if err if you know like if I get to see her eh mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that I have a janggut it's okay because I I saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
ya ya I mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa tau if for me kan aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas mm
ya because I realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know err I I don't mind but
like I am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka jer nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
err yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila err macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
okay okay I I try to I try to from my memory lah because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so err what happened was err after primary school kan pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from yishun you see I went to saint andrew's school err which is located dekat potong pasir so jauh ah saint andrew's kat potong pasir so saint andrew's dekat potong pasir err aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school kan mula pukul tujuh setengah
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the or the bus so I start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because err there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan kan
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar eh
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom I remembered because your mom is err your mom is very strict err woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite err err how to say how should I put it eh verbal
ya she's she's fine with me I I I I actually you know what I I love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know I mean I mean not as close lah because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but I I appreciate the
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old lah that is err there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did lah but not not not for a very long time lah sekejap aje kita lepak then after that err I bumped into your dad
err he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said eh uncle err how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
ah then after that um ya so um your dad aku jumpa dia then after that err you did ask me this question before eh bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam eh
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda tau
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad lah my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
err during on his birthday right two years ago I think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya rather than to just stay home watch blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now kan dia orang dia orang kasih err facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so err what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class ah join a class yang singapore punya funding
I forgot what is it called future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some err security course so ya so
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that eh uncle how are you
okay lah same same lah like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that lah
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road lah sekarang
yes yes that's a good segway actually because um I mean it it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam err doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
hmm okay err is it it's due to the whole COVID punya situation sekarang kan
oh you do err facebook punya session like live punya session is it oh that's cool you know what I found out that err one of our friend's apa ni boy cazly because I did meet up err met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time lah so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook punya account I am not a
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku I
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why I do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many um you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
tak I don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap I I like to be alone and I'm not lonely hmm do I have an imaginary kawan
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang ah
so what you're telling me that you have like err you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau I I I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive err person seseorang yang positive lah senang cakap
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada jer macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever oh so then you know that that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of um negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar lah music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
hmm I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia lah but depends orang I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from penang my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that err dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather err ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari
kahwin lari so daripada penang tu aku punya datuk macam this is a true story ya this is a true story so err what happened was my they fell in love I don't know how maybe under a tree then after that err datuk arwah datuk aku
yes so err that's the maternal side um my mum's father lah so err arwah datuk aku tu
dia I think he was from thailand also
okay I'm not sure oh no he's from like like descendants of india or something like that lah gedebak gedebuk then after that err they fell in love
under a tree bawah pokok then after that balik lari pergi ke penang for them to get married
wait let me get it straight nenek kau punya kakak which is your
wow that is banyak anak untuk tujuh belas is a lot of kids lah tujuh belas is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves wow what a woman wow so this is your grand aunty right
memang banyak ah they have like you know like banyak
ya so seventeen is quite a number aku rasa
of numbers so err back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then err they stayed in penang dia orang duduk kat penang then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that I'm not sure aku lupa
then after that err duduk dekat err barrack police err together with my father's father which is my paternal grandfather ah so they became best friends they became best friends then after that my err my mak aku dengan bapak aku
match is it how you is that how you say it matchmake ke apa
matchmake melayu cakap apa eh kalau matchmake melayu cakap apa
kahwin kahwin kahwin kahwin yes kuih kahwin kahwin try lah kuih saya kuih kahwin kahwin married married okay um so so so they they they were matchmake then dia orang kahwin err then after that a few years later dapat kakak aku
kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december lah ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu err because of the whole current COVID situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight lah
his name is a tricky one lah err pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so um
nama dia is luq L U Q and then after that ada L U Q luq luq luq
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so err
luq lucien so that lucien tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy hmm so I like how they they pronounce err stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy lah but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
okay music part oh so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me ah with my family alright I guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay ah berbual pasal music ah no lah nah I'm just I'm just kidding that's why that's why I love you lah because you ah whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing ah
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
roughly um you know um err as you know I'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then I could been listening to no at first I bought a I bought a guitar I don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical um you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes lah as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated oh ya you do
yang penting kau terror wow that should be that should be your next err malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar lah kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and I I have to say I start I started quite late lah I started quite late then after
I when when I get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of kan kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when I was in saint andrew's school kan aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
ya yes pasal okay err the reason why I got myself into the whole which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to um dance music
some techno punya stuff some err defected err record stuff which is quite cheesy lah to be honest with you like err they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so mm
so aku dengar um techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres ah so they they had err like like like different
genres like sub genres ah within that that genres so I listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so err it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
err I had a I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat sentosa dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a and to mix like
a a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix err satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop ah
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable A right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my err end of it I would like to produce my own track I I would love to have my music in the in the playlist
lagu original it's preferable lah you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play err like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have err you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
in that kind of genre lah in that kind of context mm ya I mean the whole thing for me aku rasa tak
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was ya I was playing in like um in sentosa which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak ah pergi discotheque ah mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I I was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so I hooked up with err a friend of mine then after um together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
err aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago err so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party ah so then we had we fly in the we flew in their to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created I created art not say I created I mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment err value to singapore which which is at the highest standard err at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we err charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make err money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya lah
err now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know

ketinggian is it
oh sekarang awak cerita dengan saya eh

but then now apa tu macam mana how how how do you overcome your fear
is it uh ada ada ada orang cakap begitu tak mmhmm
oh awak seorang begitu ke ada yang lain
oh tak dapat buat ah oh okay alright okay nice talking to you
kakak kalau ada three wish kakak nak wish apa
a'ah lah kalau apa-apa jer wish dia
so macam top up gitu ah
macam magic gitu
err kalau ada wish eh
first wish nak kahwin ah kot
tapi kalau takde boyfriend pun takpe suami dah jadi
going to three months kot
okay lah dia macam probation period dah rupa gitu
so far belum ah
baru tadi oh
mm I mean we still meet ah just pakai mask and stuff
kita actually meet twice a week seh
ah tak serik lah
uh I met his ibu like oh my god nervous uh I call her for now I call her cik dulu lah cik cik suka makan apa cik suka western ke suka indian ke
uh cik cakap apa-apa jer
tak lah tak tak tak kita pergi kat Al-Ameen woodlands
memang nak jumpa dia ah uh uh so actually it was supposed to be earlier but then bapa dia tak kasi like the bapa don't let the mum go out so then only on friday then the bapa let then okay alhamdulillah then I nervous like heck sia
uh so mak dia jer tahu uh uh
sebab dia tak rapat dia cakap he doesn't even talk to his brothers that much then never really go out then I'm like does your brothers know then like ya
tapi kita berbual sampai malam-malam then every time he'll be like I think my brothers sus me already
then I'm like kalau tahu tahu lah
ya sama
mm mm so far takde alhamdulillah like also because right
so like I read up that it was like uh macam satu adventurous and then satu lagi practical like bila sama-sama dia bagus and dua-dua macam bara api gitu jadi macam passion gitu lah
I don't know ah I don't know belum lagi ah so ya so ya but I forgot our I forgot our chinese zodiac
api jer eh
ah tapi tak lah tak lah garang sangat kan
to betul-betul macam
I macam lagi dua ke tiga gitu I pun terlupa around there lah
I think so lah tapi I think his is at most four years gitu
electric engineer eh electrical engineering ah gitu-gitu ah
uh tapi like
he was telling me also lah like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life gitu so takde direction gitu so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
thought that err because dia punya poly punya course takde exam
so he thought maybe ada exam lagi senang gitu then he thought like maybe like even without macam passion he can still macam buat lah macam survive gitu but then apparently he's like not surviving very well
ya but then he say he finish exam first lah sebab besok dengan besok besok ada
ada exam
if you ask me I say go ahead lah macam if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
ah baru twenty five seh
as from engineering dengan engineering gitu kan
oh boleh macam tu eh
ada strategy tu
macam investment kot I don't know lah eh
tak that's the thing like macam he knows
that he like suka and he wants to do like research in the industry gitu but he don't know where to start and how to get there gitu
uh uh that's what I told him also like that's the first thing I ask macam asal tak pergi digipen like why not then after he say eh I got search for that
then go electrical engineering baru eh
ya ya ya I nak minum air
kerusi aku ni pusing ah
macam suruh dia pergi course counselling ah
I am not the right person to ask also siapa lah aku kan
tak tahu bila lah but some day inshallah
ya lah ya lah ya lah tak ada minat kan
ya sebab sekolah lama seh like you you school like continuously right
mm the macam the momentum kan
so sekarang ni twenty twenty jadi next year
uh huh two a'ah betul two
entah lah tengok dulu lah lepas kahwin kot
and I have no pressure to get married so dia macam so you know what don't stress
lepas kahwin baru fikir ya
once your suami is okay with it then like if anybody else says right you can just like kau siapa suami aku cakap okay apa
uh uh kau siapa
maybe in two to three years then I'm like okay lah kau fikir dulu lah
because to me it's not about the duration is not about macam oh lepas dua tahun nak kahwin oh lepas tiga tahun nak kahwin no it's more like
that's why cause kahwin tak senang seh
ya sia mahal seh
ya exactly and then then during your wedding already people like oh your wedding going to be besar ain punya nanti besar-besar tau then I'm like siapa cakap siapa cakap a'ah I'm like excuse me
exactly eh suka hati jer main cakap jer
uh uh malangnya
mm maybe not necessarily lah my perfect wedding will be dekat kampung ah makan ulam-ulam semua
maybe kampung kat buangkok ke
ada yang satu dekat buangkok ah pulau ubin ke mana tahu weh kan best
ya I know habis pulau semakau pulau tekong
ya but I would I would rather have like a wedding at pulau ubin eh like siapa tak nak pergi pulau ubin okay tidak dijemput bagus filter filter
a'ah ah bukan tak jemput tapi korang tak nak datang betul tak betul ah bagus
ya ya it's okay ah this one macam plus minus lah mm mm
ya I mean I've seen people get married at tuas so I'm like siapa nak pergi tuas
ya so bagus ah siapa takde motor tak boleh datang
a'ah bagus tidak dijemput
uh uh uh uh dia dia saja jer
ke hujung eh
kirim salam sampaikan salam nak kasi duit PayNow takpe
uh uh zaman sekarang semua dah PayNow
but ya it like sebab kalau drive dari luar kan nampak dia punya
nama dia seafood restaurant so I don't know whether they like the building is owned by the seafood restaurant or like they do it at the seafood restaurant itself ya
sentosa mahal
go harbourfront go batam terus
feels like that eh rasa macam gitu ya it's like because
dari sentosa kan I always see all this ferry go to batam kalau lah boleh naik satu feri tu kan bagus
best juga tu
mm best apa
habis wallet
tu dia punya tu tight sikit dia punya schedule dia tak boleh lambat
mm mm ya like jangan nak janji melayu eh janji melayu kapal dah jalan eh please eh
ah lepas tu orang lepas tu kalau makcik makcik semua dah lambat habis semua orang muda dekat terus kan habis clubbing terus
tu bachelorette party seh all out seh
uh mocktail ada mocktail ada ya
ya it's a rooftop bar very nice ya me and adik went
you should I mean it's not cheap lah but like ya mm mm it's just strange because it feels like a nice place to for a date but I came with my brother instead so I'm like mm okay ya I went with adik
ya because right we wanted to get the very nice looking drinks and you know macam instagrammable gitu ah but then when we went
it was a like a brunch punya promotion I think uh brunch menu so it was like a buffet instead so I'm like okay lah
free flow macam barbecue then there's also free flow like telur nak omelette ke scrambled egg ke apa burger uh it's very nice but the I remember like everything was nice you know the
pasta you can choose your sauce chilli crab ke nak aglio olio ke apa uh then
uh and then the tacos I didn't try but then adik said it was nice
when I went then the there's like it comes with like a main so I bought the main and it was very nice it's some seafood soup something like that then you cecah dengan roti
uh but then paling best tu barbecue barbecue dia
cause like the sotong and the ikan and the ayam
tak dia barbecuekan dia macam counter kita just
of all things kan ada sotong ada sausage mm okay ada ayam then you know what was there
but I don't know maybe kita tak tahu makan or something lah maybe we just don't know how to eat lah cause we didn't like it ah very much
it tasted like meat you know then I'm like what is this it's very strange ya but then the good part also ada tempat solat
sebab ada banyak benda-benda kan
oh pahit eh
it's just it's just hilarious lah cause every single time then hazim will be like nak pergi staycation then I'm like what me and you
ajak him first
kekek seh
but I don't know whether abang hafiz will be okay with him and if he will be okay with abang hafiz also
can you imagine abang hafiz with another abang hafiz okay then you just put that in mind
think in the end eh in the end they will just like abang hafiz will call you and then hazim will call me like
tapi voucher belum lagi dapat
uh because tak ambil leave mm
baru boleh ambil leave
ya cause now also I need to take leave then tengok budak-budak sekolah ke tak
ya cause dorang deaths I mean not deaths lah but like dorang punya cases like macam tak terjaga jer
mm mm did you see the numbers everytime umi right like whoa wah malaysia punya numbers naik then I'm like umi
it's always because of like macam
tak lah like the whole show I think wasn't that macam
cautious about it dorang macam tak berhati-hati nak ikut rules tau
and then people are saying like that's only the one that's tested then the one yang tak tested
ya and their country also not that develop like especially macam tengok the medical facilities and stuff kan dalam the hospitals semua tu
it's the culture lah like dorang tak macam
gabra sangat lah I will say ya that's why
ya lah macam conspiracy theory lah
I mean in an emergency and pandemic like this kadang-kadang cannot help it
terpaksa you know because of the resources that they have and stuff like that
so macam it's sad but
terpaksa ah
mm entah lah eh kalau orang tua kita yang paling degil kot macam dorang yang selalu lawan why cannot why cannot wear then after that nanti dorang yang
dorang yang selalu marah-marah orang tau I always see you know all those like boomer whatsapp video then always send one right
then it's always it's always the older population tau is always they are the one that is scolding yang budak-budak muda then budak-budak muda pun nak cakap apa
just follow the instructions government cakap tak boleh government cakap if you don't do this fine three hundred dollar not I say one I say not I say one this one governments say one ya
wah and then there is me I was at choa chu kang interchange okay I was waiting for hazim you know I was waiting for my boyfriend and then and macam cause I came early what dah siap kan jadi duduk dulu lah kan you know dekat drop off
err when you drop off ada kerusi-kerusi gitu
so I duduk situ at the drop off area duduk dulu lah tengok TikTok ke apa dulu ah
tengah lepak-lepak habis lepas tu sebelah like
then after that kita macam kita pakai mask kita tak kita tak berbual pun dalam I didn't even notice she was there I swear
then I was just like tiktoking then after that suddenly this group of aunties right like I don't know where they came from also tapi tiba-tiba dorang datang tau like this group of like five aunties I think they came then after that uh dorang macam berbual-bual at this area like very near me ah beside this aunty was sitting so I think they were one group
like one big group tapi cuma ada satu tempat duduk so dia duduk lah
ada lima orang then satu aunty tengah duduk jadi agaknya enam lah tu tak tahu I ni macam primary school maths gitu
ya but then jap jap jap jap I haven't belum habis lagi and then right so he halau them already like kesian this aunties you know they just like there talking they tried to adhere to as many rules as possible already they just want to talk you know then uh uh
like they not even like like not wearing not even spitting or anything you just you know speaking you know tengah berbual-berbual jer seh
after that dorang jalan lah maka terpaksa mereka jalan
this aunty who's sitting dia macam tengah macam lengah-lengah lah nak duduk-duduk because baru duduk tau baru duduk
the pakcik came to me
sejak bila aku tak boleh duduk kat kerusi then I'm like
err okay ah okay then I just like perangai sia then after that I I just left lah like my mood no good already lah then the the aunty who was
sitting at the other seat right then she look at me walk I think she wasn't planning to walk but because I walk right then she look at me then she's like aiyo semua also everything also cannot now semua pun tak boleh then I'm like
a'ah nak buat macam mana aunty takpe lah
tak nak kena saman so ya
I'm telling you ah if we don't wear if you never wear mask and someone sampai sekarang eh the one person sneezed and that person is let's say positive eh
liao satu I'm telling you it's gonna have COVID already
ya so it was dah nak kat satu tahun ah oh my god ya sia
wah cepat seh
then after that only because of that kan only sebab uh of this kan then like
dorang punya living conditions got raised up as well which I think is a positive side effect of this I mean I'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but there are some positive side effect is like one of them is like this macam dormitory is only now baru tahu oh dulu kan dorang tinggal then after that I was thinking
cause kalau tak siapa tahu eh like when was the last time you actually lap itu benda punya handle like I don't know ya so I feel like it's a good reset in a sense lah
when when I was like when I use the soap and I wash wash like betul-betul punya wash like scrub scrub you know the eight step gitu kan
be like what she doing why you wash until so clean like but then ada lah aunty yang cute lah cuba ikut juga lah
macam ya but ya now they don't
ya ya ya is like ya I mean that's why I say like I think there's positive side effects also lah I mean it's not a good thing but you know if you think about it another way mm mm ada lah hikmahnya
so macam kadang-kadang like weekly she will ask us lah so how's your COVID situation when we're like oh it's getting better here you know
cause orang tak ikut orang sana tak ikut rule
like it's a law tapi dorang tak enforce sangat
lepas tu selenga I don't know lah I think
have the whole the whole island eh the whole singapore tengah geram dengan dia
check check that one time eh satu kali
it's just that everybody was just wondering macam sejak bila boleh dua belas orang
kalau phase three pun lapan orang jer
mm tapi
in all honesty at least they jujur but actually saya ada dua belas orang lah that time you know even though you might get saman or what but
ya at least dia come clean
kita sejujur-jujurnya eh are we even as careful as we were las time kan
oh my god how macam mana tu
macam gitu eh bilang orang tak payah makan sudah
ya it's basically tak masuk akal
I'm like nak cakap pun fikir sikit ah like
I I think even a secondary school kid boleh fikir that um even kalau macam situational writing eh I wouldn't come up with this
oh wah not bad sia the job like quite chill for me I've been like searching for jobs because like susah lah like I don't know if what I should do with my life right now because I I'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so um sometimes they will pick a fight lah but like uh uh I'm used to it already they will be like eh today don't have the discount meh you sure or not ya then I like uh
oh my god kesian apa like I okay lah because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the uh aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
ya I also got something like that because ah in we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
then lepas itu err this girl fadreena um I think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay lah I ask her to come join her also I mean join them as well so at first it was like okay ah
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately ah then after that right my friend was alone lah like she was left alone lah
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short mah so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt lah then she my friend like we like how to say ah err like she kena back my she kena back fadreena then fadreena not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like ugh
like uh the boyfriend is quite old not old but like a few years older then she also say about that like what my boyfriend all like old what is your problem then like just cari pasal lah with my friend then ya ya like she think like the whole world revolve around her or what
oh wait i think I saw it was cause if tak salah it was on his instagram still right like the picture of them together but until now he haven't delete meh
the little actions he do I guess like fold the clothes all ya then I saw he also like apa treat treat her right treat her food all sedap seh ya I wanted oh my gosh three hundred it's three hundred
kau serious apa kau serious
ya oh my god it's scary though cause the first thing right dia kan engaged he's engaged and then now he's like what he cannot move on from rachel when he should be like focusing on his wife kan ya exactly
not really toxic relationship lah but like cause now I I think her life is a movie kan like a drama you know no serious cause she got two guys um so right now she's in a relationship like baru-baru jer lah the she apa itu this guy like proposed to her
but not like nak kahwin propose that kind of type but it's like uh girlfriend like will you be my girlfriend ya but then the guy is in so like now she's like thinking whether she should
so now she's like deciding lah I mean she still she loves her current boyfriend now but like to think of having to go through the next two years is also like a bit hard for her so if you are her what apa apa kau akan buat
that time recently I think was just this week lah uh they had a fight then because like my friend right she called the guy because after like uh dia dah at night right they can call already right so she call the guy ah then apparently the guy macam like I don't know why like bingit or something like cranky
the new guy obviously want to beat him up lah it's like really because it's ya like I don't know it's just a bro thing then uh apparently what else ah he got the ex got also like macam maki dia
maki the my friend ya like on a tweet then also wanted to make a thread about my friend but apparently he deleted it so I don't know problem sia ya it was damn problematic ya
oh ya I cannot I cannot sabar so I just watch every week
oh tak as in like for ratings right usually they say ratings is for like we watch on the but for most of us is like we watch on online mah so I think that's why the ratings not as high ya but
from what aku observe ya from what aku observe right it's really like that like every workplace will have that one guy who is tua
like they should look at themselves in the mirror sebelum dia orang nak prey on younger girls like seriously
especially those yang belum legal like that's that's like that's like a crime
burn burn the anak
ya like macam mana kau boleh buat like that to your own own kid sia that's so sad
no uh ya then they say like uh apparently I think either one of the mother or the the boyfriend was taking drugs then it's can also be like the cause of why they killed the child because you know when bila kau ambil drugs right then you won't like know what you're doing that kind of thing
wah so sad oh my god I cannot leh cause you got see or not if you scroll down below right you got see the gambar of the child
ya usually if like terbunuh it's like you the kid is like abused lah like like
no they never say abuse but like um they say she just they she killed the child in like february I think then like three months later then they burn the anak ya
ya then the kawan also like a bit bodoh ah go and help to
ya it's damn sad because like ah the father the the biological father of the the anak right uh was like finding the child but then apparently they said the mother
mm tak kasih tak kasih dia tengok or like tak kasih information about where the child is or what so for like five months I think the father was like finding the child and then end up the child mati
sakit hati sia ya
psycho sial gila sial this girl is gila like gila
aku wah aku embarrassed sia like legit aku macam rasa malu
ya it's not on it's not like apa itu it's not on like purpose it's on purpose ya it's on purpose then I was like wow how can you like put him in a cage all sia and the cage is like a a cage for cats eh not even for like humans or what
they got other anak you know like they they got like the younger siblings leh I think
ya like like those typical macam you know those malay drama right then got the the evil evil fella
hijrah hijrah fund
then uh bastard oh my god itu terus just pergi neraka sial itu oh my god uh
then ya I saw the syed saddiq also oh my god he always kena sial when all the older err ministers you saw the syed
ya that's what I want to say also like because they all like macam oh you must because I'm older than you right so you must respect whatever I say that kind of thing right but end up whatever they say is like really stupid sial like really
a'ah oh my god did you see the kanye mess oh my god I don't know what he doing sial like legit apa dia tengah fikir dalam uh otak dia sekarang
I should just go lah and spend two years in wah rabak pe lima tahun eh kena tunggu
ya like most of them never wear mask and also like I don't believe the cases really like zero in malaysia I I think there's more just dia orang belum report you know when they are sick
ya ah how is he a how is he even a president aku tak boleh I can't I just cannot
oh my god he's so like apa itu macam what's that word uh he's so calculative ah kedekut yes
ya yang birthday surprise
tak salah pe
I mean like dah dah berbual sampai one one plus
so he and his girlfriend dah kat situ then me and my other guy friend
some Marvel Marvel punya like
uh what else I forgot lah what else ada kat dia punya package yesterday I I read together with them then ya lah
you know like my birthday that time macam
is a company yang buat
so this one we do our own ah like small picnic mat some food very macam
that day punya is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
so the the the macam deciding factor is
if the birthday boy bawa motor ke tak
and my guy friend ni yang the non-birthday guy
dapat kereta ke tak he can drive what okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend ah eh like
you you ask him lah go out for once tak yah bawa motor then I say but
because ya he then I say you use lah the excuse kalau pergi Sentosa like
parking mahal then he say but can park at the Seah Seah Im eh he always park there
boleh pass ah
because he did say he did say that uh she did macam bilang dia
my other guy friend cannot get a car kereta bapa dia
what's the plan ah sudah lupa
ah actually if you ask me frankly I prefer kalau pergi Marina Barrage
because dah dekat dengan kedai makan
just just so that macam tak waste time on the road I feel lah
from the other guy he feels that kan macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua if he tak bawa motor
I I lazy lah go through all that apa monorail eh
okay if we go Sentosa we must start like lepas zohor lah that kind
ya but then he has class ngaji so
ya so need to wait he finish ngaji by the time like two already then nak travel all the way to Sentosa three plus
kita kita nya more like museum attraction kind
uh apa eh
the girlfriend say ah sometimes he like penat from so he
then I'm like kalau he penat like you know
he dah biasa buat
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay uh apa you wouldn't believe it we wanna go Tampines hub also naik motor
even though it's like dekat gila
no lapan ratus lebih
to naik motor lah so cannot stop him
so if if he still macam go for ngaji then most likely is Marina Barrage ah cause
macam we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
dia by six sudah tutup I think
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be biar lah
you know the kedai makan dekat sebelah
I've never eaten there right so I ask him agak agak berapa ah kena bayar like how much is the
korang korang makan apa sia dorang beli banyak ah all guys
then she's like eh then I then I told her lah macam
worse come to worst aku beli air jer ah
then she was like kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air jer
yeah I mean if there's simple food like nasi goreng mi goreng I'll buy lah
ah like this type ah macam shell out eh I feel
yeah macam I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask uh mana kau nak makan ah
point ah I will tell them takut like penuh
uh I did say if we go Sentosa tak ya gi Marina Barrage Vivocity area ada pe then he was like tak nak nak makan restaurant atas sikit
Vivo uh that's what I thought hmm then dorang kata apa nak makan apa Mac then I'm like
kenal us lah cause she knows like
ya and she's not like malu malu dengan kita
she she was the one she was the one who said eh korang nak jumpa for dinner tak a few days ago then I was like
nak discuss about this lah
yeah then I was like masa tu I busy
uh we were in the same class tapi kita ada different clique
ah subset ah dia macam
abeh ada smaller group
hari raya ah hmm
the the guy tak suka the same person I don't like
the other guy also don't like tapi dia pandai bermuka
so sometimes raya also he never come then I a bit sad lah cause like I mean like I close with them what then only me and the other guy ada
ya no loss then he say it's okay uh I will go to your house for raya with the other guy lah just the three of us I'm like okay
ya I think hari raya is the only time that whole big group meet
Arshad say in the group uh apa apa kau kalau tak pergi then kita tak nak pergi ah
just go anyway I also bajet lah I spend
ni nak keluar for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
I also macam don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
I said that then then the the other girls they alah uh apa you never go then macam boring ah
kalau pergi lima orang then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
no tak pernah pergi
macam company just another person
tapi three three people is still not bad
I told you what dorang kena kena buang kerja
the blue one the kaki tangling
yesterday ah the girlfriend was telling me kau dah naik yang merah
take lah try taking the apa blue one
this is just before you went umrah
it's just before you went umrah
Aisha aku takut Aisha aku takut
ya I told her that then she's like tak betul lah
oh ya I haven't reply ni
cannot tangguh anymore
semalam oh after we talk about the birthday thing we talk about like other things also lah
then she a bit malu ah and then she was like korang tau eh we we know everything
they uh he saw her in school but he wants to kenal kenal with her right
you know you know the line that guy like uh apa guys like to use or like they ah basically he said uh dia the girl that eh hari tu I saw you at

but you staycation kat mana seh
bila eh thursday eh
okay ah then we kita pergi tuesday
tak tapi celton oh ya celton end at thirty oh ya
nora tengah buat apa seh
mm itu jer
probably okay dah stop now one two three
so beauty to me I would define it as personality and manners adab lah adab
mm okay look before kita start kan um
uh okay macam mana nak cakap eh um
so macam uh sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana
ten years down the road bila kita dah ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
um macam for example friendship lah macam kita nak buat kawan baru kan
err tahu tahu
inshaallah tak
okay okay untuk aku kan because poli poli aku lah macam what I can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
macam mana eh um define
my course banyak cliques tau then um in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation kan so macam apa aku observe kan
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is dia orang popular and then they are
macam for me uh in my course most of the cliques yang macam the big cliques right they tend to I mean they are closer to people um they
they are closer to people that macam ada good looks semua so macam
so it's very very subjective lah in terms of macam mana dia orang select uh friends and ya and how the friendship last till
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so macam teaching ke uh
ya design ke ataupun like social service ya F&B also then I think what is for me if I want to be an employer then I would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
it depends beauty macam
but I think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain uh like macam for example for female right they like males macam
the lelaki yang ada certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
aku rasa macam are we talking in like first first
um like kau nak share
okay uh okay untuk aku kan macam if I want to find a partner
then I would say beauty in their personality and mindset sebab macam
uh for me I place I I put more I mean macam macam mana eh my first first
how do you say it macam
uh for me to identify that person as my partner in the future I would uh my first check list is like mindset or personality so macam ya because macam
macam mana eh kalau kita uh kita tak
we are into only the good looks then like I said macam in apa ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so macam to me I will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect lah so macam mindset and personality so macam personality and mindset is something that your bring uh macam mana eh it's like since yang kau dah ada personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset um like
macam mana eh what uh your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods uh rather than your looks because for me I emphasize on the personality macam like for example ten years down the road kan kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita when you have your children then like if you
okay uh firstly memang aku ada watak a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly macam
uh memang high punya
dia lebih lawa lah ah
before we go to the next question I want to ask macam
okay okay best ke dalam topic of friendship kan
friendship bila kita buat kawan uh buat
buat kawan for the first time
to me uh in terms of boys or girls I would say girls sebab macam
I don't know whether boys I mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like macam their
macam the friendship is base more on macam
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly macam I mean
not to generalize lah macam like boys they generally talk about like
uh apa macam like topics that are not so emotionally involved I would say ya
mm actually for that topic aku pernah lah belajar lah in aku punya course if like
macam what we think is a society it's not like um good but then it's still functioning so
macam is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional it's it's called something functional something lah
rather than to have a society that macam everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of macam they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
disanjung yes yes yes
macam content is it the content they deliver
they they apa tu they are attached more onto the expectation rather than reality
lain macam extra
okay so for fashion um back in those days macam nineties eighties kan
macam the fashion do um I'm not really sure because I don't live in that era but like the fashion mm
err yes based on pictures also lah then yes it's very laid back and macam
like I'm I'm not sure whether it's true tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan dengan the fashion trend you know so macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now macam
we have like the uh what the term E-boy E-girl then the uh then the what type of new dress macam hipster hipster so macam
mm so macam
the no um the fashion macam mana eh do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
macam is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so macam do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
oh pasal journey is it
apa tu macam um right now uh
macam mana eh uh so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is macam kau ada banyak kawan then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is um ada ada uh ada value lah then ada macam ada tempat dekat society but someone macam just dia macam apa seorang
then dia macam pentingkan not really pentingkan diri as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care lah so like what what you think of like um this society standard macam ya
that was jodoh seh
we ngam-ngam
and I think for our friendship also um we are not that judgmental like in uh between ourselves so macam
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and kita macam banyak advice each other so so like it's really something
the negative side there's uh society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself lah since beauty was so macam
ada okay uh ada kebaikan dalam kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung
mm so it's like full package lah macam good looking very humble also
but I heard okay so that one is um macam kita kirakan macam uh role model yang macam
someone who is err so macam mira filzah dia macam actress kan
western eh uh aku tak berapa tengok
mm okay then for ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam uh pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam in your own
macam those not as
those not popular lah so macam kawan kau
ke or like someone
yang macam dia lawa and very like lemah lembut and all
it's something macam
ya macam uh kan cakap pasal uh apa tu
deen and deen and dunya so macam apa tu dunya means like world lah so macam
dunia tak di akhirat lah so
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak I mean not to generalize okay but like budak-budak sekarang is more
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore kan dia uh nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
so macam the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world lah instead of like the the uh afterlife
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those yang macam dia ada dua lah so macam dunya and deen
so like more macam be comfortable in your own skin
ya sure okay so kita tinggal like a few more minutes lah so like I would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
okay so aku start first lah so regret aku is to be the beauty standard so macam dulu uh secondary one primary six semua kan aku macam very uh very insecure lah sebab macam
kita ada influence dengan K pop apa so macam kita nampak woo macam lawa seh and kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua I mean kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam uh we are not there lah so macam ya so like what I regret was like uh
like aku terlalu pentingkan like kecantikan dari luar instead of dari dalam ya
um then jap
like I think message something like to to remind you during your apa macam uh bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat lah I would say
um the priority will be uh ke uh work live and
I think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage lah so I think
I think the pressure will be more bila kawan-kawan kau dah start to slowly get married so macam you'll feel very pressured so um my message would be um
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause macam to to to learn to prioritise
do ask ask to do macam-macam
orang kaya kan bagus nak jadi nak jadi kaya-raya
boleh tolong mak bapa sekarang kan pembelanjaan kan banyak that's why I need a lot of money lah and
furthermore now my age is already dah tiga puluh lebih tahun
so I will need the income the additional money to support my mum lah and my dad ni semua
oh ya lagi dua wish okay lagi dua wish is mula-mula nak jadi orang kaya selepas tu nak jadi orang yang kurus
cause I am right now I'm my weight is about one one two so I'm quite fat lah and dulu-dulu kan I was actually um eighty kilo only I was quite fit lah go to gym one week four times
per day I mean four times a week I do all kinds of exercise even at one point in time I even had a abs lah kirakan dua pack ke
empat pack punya abs lah kirakan dah tu I also last time belajar karate judo belajar mixed martial arts semua
cuma sekarang jer lah dah apa tu dah kerja kan jadi pun dah malas
um lepas kaya sihat okay err since my age now is tiga puluh dua tahun I'm just waiting for three more years lah then I wish that I can buy my own I don't want to buy private cause the maintenance tinggi sangat
so I just want to buy itu pun kalau boleh empat bilik lima bilik ataupun masionette lah mana yang I mampu why
cause kalau beli rumah besar sikit boleh rental income so I can meet one of the agent yang I kenal which is my friend lah
ask them for advice so they can help me lah um tolong cari kalau boleh pun nak nak beli rumah dekat-dekat dengan hospital ataupun dekat-dekat dengan any healthcare punya tempat macam polyclinic or what why
cause kalau kita pindah dekat situ I mean kalau kita ada rumah kat situ
kita boleh rental kan rumah dengan nurse nurse lah lagipun nurse gaji kan okay boleh tahan so kirakan kita boleh earn quite a lot from that rental income ah kirakan ah itu saja lah yang my three wishes lah very realistic punya wish ah cause kalau kita wish merepek pun I mean uh bukannya boleh mencapai kan so I will always wish on things that I can achieve I can confirm I can achieve
okay lah kalau if I have any superpowers out of the three right
hmm superpowers eh err superpowers what are the three eh apa best eh mm
tengok gambar avengers
superpowers ah jadi thor ah
thor best ah thor thor is the god of thunder dia boleh pergi to a different realm boleh pergi space boleh pergi sana sini
thor pun kuat kan dia punya ada hammer dia lah hammer ada dua macam macam hammer lah
abeh lepas tu dia boleh pergi mana dia nak pergi he's the strongest ah actually but then there's also another one strongest which is also my choice is a
captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady lah but uh actually kalau you can make it into a man punya character pun bagus juga
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos pun kalah okay there's one more is I like to be the witch ah a witch
from also from avengers kenapa
cause yang time kita tengok end games tu actually kalau
thanos dia tak panggil ah apa tu dengan dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia who make it link it's actually witch tu witch tu yang akan kalahkan dia lah cause he's already
on the verge of losing bila bila kalah rabak ah but then cause he asked the dia punya kuncu-kuncu dia untuk bring down the ring
so all the yang spaceship besar punya cannon tu kena tembak jer rabak ah kena that's the three superhero that I want
hulk no cause hulk dia besar sangat actually kalau tinggal dekat singapore nak jadi hulk aduh
sebab tu kat singapore kalau nak beli kereta pun jangan beli kereta besar beli kereta kecil sudah kalau beli kereta besar kereta punya parking pun bukannya besar-besar pun
yang parking lama lagi halus-halus jer nak pergi sana sini aduh nak belok jer nak u-turn jer leceh
kita punya roads actually very very small so it's the best kalau
even your body jangan lah jadi macam bodybuilder have a small physique lah kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat
meal tu apa makan apa-apa ah
ah until now I pernah makan
itu that is very memorable apasal
itu whale meat yang paling mahal sekali
actually dia punya whale meat dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis jer dia potong
lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan ramen ramen
dia punya japanese version punya ramen lah then kita makan
selepas tu first I thought macam dia punya dia punya portion dia is quite big tau besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih too little
oh it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause uh it's not sashimi usually orang jepun kalau kasih sashimi dia akan letak dekat a different plate
but this one is cooked uh but not like deep fry punya cook lah macam I think steam or what lah cause
dia letak on top of the ramen itself so we must eat along on the ramen dengan dia punya
condiments ah basically dengan dia punya seaweed semua lah
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually um the most unique lah paling unique sekali and dia punya
restaurant is actually located outside meiji shrine ah yang pasal halal
tak halal tu actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese punya
restaurant kan once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else macam
babi or any uh meat stuff lah even ayam ke daging ke apa so once they sell barang
seafood is purely hundred percent just barang seafood jer
okay okay yang itu paling best okay yang dia punya whale bila makan it's eh dia punya potong slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
lah put inside my mouth it just melts dia kira macam makan butter gitu cuma rasa dia is bukan butter rasa dia is lemak tapi bukan lemak macam
kambing ke lemak ah no tau it's just lemak
but you just taste the sea water so kirakan
lemak ikan and whale punya lemak is really one of a kind ah it's really wah if
kalau awak pernah makan macam sea urchin ke apa ah macam gitu I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat itu itu yang very very very unique
ah tak pasti isi or fats
but uh mostly it's I think fats ah cause kalau isi whale kan is a tough kan
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut even fats kambing
ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti melts in the mouth
ah so that is the thing and lagipun dia punya I think dia potong tipis-tipis lah so I can't really
actually takde yang okay compare japan korea lah kita jangan cakap pasal thailand
thailand is dia punya makan just semuanya pedas-pedas jer
uh japan boleh tahan uh but japan punya makan is betul-betul
yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu is you know what um makanan korea
cause makanan korea even dia punya mee hitam tu yang
orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa exactly the same as kita punya mee rebus
yes jajangmyeon cause kita punya mee rebus semua the difference is jajangmyeon is macam dia macam basah-basah
dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa exactly the same macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah and of course kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap cause why kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi
and ada telur ada apa so dia orang punya is a mixture of japanese
punya taste bud dengan mix with into mee rebus punya rasa that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique lah quite unique tapi yang I really like about korea is dia punya daging bulgogi
itu I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner dia punya daging bulgogi dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas enough ialah cukup
cause pasal pasal daging bulgogi dia is macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu bulgogi tu you imagine macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate fuh lepas tu makan dengan nasi
nasi biasa nasi panas-panas eh steam rice ke apa
sedap you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you takkan rasa jelak I mean according to my taste lah cause I really like the daging bulgogi
yes I've tried wagyu beef yang halal punya actually we have
until apa tu um A three ke A two usually halal punya wagyu beef there's no A five yang tak halal punya iya yang A five cause um
yang halal punya is actually err it's only made in australia
yang the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself lah yang halal punya is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five punya punya apa tu punya punya grading
the the wagyu beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan yang yang ah
the essence of wagyu beef ah yang banyak marbling it's also I heard there's also a
for the wagyu beef punya itu ah market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya the rest of it is a usually um
tak uh no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia punya is uh dia punya grade not that high lah but dia punya rasa okay lah actually okay lah the thing about
uh wagyu beef is just that dia punya lemak jer
yang if you if you really notice kan dia punya yang urat-urat tu is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the lemak fats is the same
what makes it different is that orang jepun ni dia punya wagyu beef dia suka potong raw
makan macam apa tu the sashimi eh then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that umami effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
ada itu umami punya effect umami effect is exactly like how you
eat macam uh apa tu
ajinomoto dia that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the wagyu beef
uh dia punya lemak-lemak dia
oh like I say just now lah I only eat bulgogi cause that's to me is the best of the best paling sedap
the bulgogi is really my got to lah I've eaten orang makan thailand makan indonesia melayu semua I just like bulgogi cause bulgogi pun kira macam-macam tau a different part of korea yang halal punya they make different type of bulgogi the one that I really like is the budak-budak yang bikin kat
that hill daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua
makanan halal from singapore from malaysia
turkey negeri arab semua ada so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque nama dia
oh tak apa-apa nama dia is is not it's a adalah I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
okay cause dia pun macam road kan so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small macam
err macam mana eh you know like those kind of arab street punya shophouses you go ah
macam gitu you go then adalah dekat situ ah actually yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu
a lot of them and also there are other specialty kan it's actually ayam rebus and dia punya ayam it's actually they take the whole
macam spring chicken dia kasih steam itu benda
and dia rebus kat dalam the chicken soup the chicken broth wah then they they just ah basically
dia tak potong tak apa the steamed chicken tu they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
ah apa tu one bowl of rice
fuh makan sedap ah actually during winter makan tu is the best ah
not really winter lah it's quite cold but not really winter yang I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
dalam minus
twelve ah minus twelve yang paling sejuk ah lepas tu yang paling best kan kat japan on the new year's day new year's day pagi-pagi bangun
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean dia punya snow dia punya snow is tak banyak must wait for the night time then we go to the
ah kalau you go cause tokyo kan is bandar kan so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields dekat yang pokok-pokok ah then you can take the snow from there
err truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore punya weather cause singapore punya weather you can only expect two
punya weather lah like uh autumn
uh apa tu spring lah winter
livelihood lah I mean tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah berapa besar lah rumah kita then lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk weather singapore sendiri dah
dah banyak apa lagi kalau imagine kita kena simpan for
winter clothings lain
autumn clothings lain
spring clothings lain summer clothings lain so we will ah take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal lah that is for me lah but unless it's ah you are
talking about we are living in japan negeri dia besar even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there dia punya rumah sana
murah-murah and actually it's freehold tau it's not macam kita lease
ninety nine years is freehold rumah dia is actually very affordable
kita punya rumah three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized punya rumah in japan freehold
punya scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area macam kita punya
tempat lah hougang ang mo kio
kita punya you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right kalau dekat jepun you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban ah it's macam dia punya heartland ah kira
is all rumah dia is all uh rumah bungalow bungalow bungalow
lepas tu yang ada tempat ada gate yang ada tempat tak ada gate but mostly tempat dia orang is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
dia punya village dia is actually a farm
dia akan farm is actually itu farm dia uh jepun punya beras kan lain kan so basically all the villagers dia akan um
apa tu have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right ah until modernization come lah but that farm itself right untuk kalau
nasi basic punya nasi is actually more than enough to feed the whole
so even until now also there are still people but not young people lah the old people ah dia orang tua-tua yang ah mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right um yang paling best kita orang tourist they let they let us enter
cause dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun
dia orang will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english yang
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english pun is actually
broken english it's not really full uh punya english the language that we learn um from our
oh budak-budak singapore kita punya english is one of the highest grade lah kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa english in all of asian punya country even if you go to like
russia even china you know apatah lagi malaysia indonesia ni semua their english level dengan budak singapore punya level
is really macam langit dengan bumi lain
oh tak for japan tak uh it depends on where you go kalau itu tempat is betul-betul hundred percent muslims okay usually macam gini even if you go
to any other country macam thailand even bali or what kan kalau if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a dua dapur
one dapur is for the halal the other dapur is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they ada dua dapur for those pure
muslims usually yang macam if you go japan is those
orang kita cakap mualaf ah orang jepun mualaf ke apa ah they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the dia punya sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually kalau macam kita punya singapore ada MUIS
ah so they also have their own punya MUIS lah dekat in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those uh restaurants yang mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think dia punya rental dia punya duit
sewa dia every month is very expensive so they need to cover lah they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive mm korea jepun all the same even bali even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop dia punya area
that's how they live their life I mean untuk kita kalau macam extra was-was kita jangan makan but you must we must know that there is actually two dapur
it's not one dapur they make they mix everything together no no no two different dapur
actually they yang the alcohol pun it's not really dapur lah it's just macam a bar just a bar place
err cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty ah but since kita pun dah ada banyak options sekarang so mm
uh what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much lah kalau macam dia cakap buah avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday nanti you get other complications when you get when you eat benda yang is too good everyday is no good if you search
there's this guru from india he say garlic is the best uh medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
uh have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic punya uh cara perubatan really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic punya treatment they all use garlic
itu aje the most the most healthiest yang I eat
apa-apa skills lah is it the the the
hardware dengan software punya skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether nak jadi apa I say I nak jadi kaya kan so
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine ah you dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja eight to five
or kerja shift or whatever
untuk cari nafkah you straightaway have an app
cause sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua they
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in negeri macam kita ni singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause kita punya negeri ah is the hub for education so if we have the right skills kita boleh bikin product from that skill
I suka makan so I kalau boleh skill untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak um but one thing eh kalau I suka masak I don't like to
masak a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before dia punya barang mahal-mahal portion besar yes dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam very posh
tetapi their fusion food macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu even dengan tekak orang putih they don't like cause um when you
fusion western dengan asian punya makanan
uh I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants yang ada makanan fusion yang betul-betul
err how to say ada dia punya rasa dia is you can actually you can want to go there again lah
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event macam birthday ke kawan-kawan nak celebrate birthday promotions ke ah probably
sekali-sekala macam gitu dah but for
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money untuk apa kan
oh ya uh the last skill eh I have eh okay basically for me eh I daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah start belajar karate lah
uh I really want to have that kind of skill untuk
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it macam example karate
ah judo ataupun mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
karate under okinawan punya style
and okinawan punya style is actually the original punya karate lah which is actually
in fact yang karate yang
orang jepun practice is actually fake
cause orang jepun punya karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about orang jepun it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese punya karate
it's called nama dia bukan karate nama dia karate-do
do dalam bahasa jepun is a way of life even judo
all the do yang kat belakang semua is actually maksud orang jepun
is a way of life so orang jepun is more on to the perfectionism
tapi if you really learn the original okinawan punya style it's more of the
the relax orang okinawa actually belajar karate like even
kalau awak awak belajar okinawa punya karate kan
even if you come late the the orang the instructor tu can actually still accept you but for orang jepun punya karate
so untuk orang okinawa punya karate is actually untuk orang malas-malas err like myself
actually orang okay the main difference between okinawa punya karate dengan japanese punya karate is this orang jepun punya karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to oo oo dia kira itu dia punya how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by uh contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think ah orang jepun punya karate is by contracting their body
untuk kasih badan dia tense
uh cause untuk dia orang what they learn from
aikido judo ni semua if you
um you can practise the real okinawan punya punya martial arts ah punya ni karate cause even
dia they call this macam kita ah nama dia bunga-bunga lah kita punya silat bunga-bunga
err orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun
punya is a
nama dia kata kata
so kirakan okinawan punya kata is actually more
practical tapi orang jepun punya kata is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't uh focus about dia punya feel
actually ini karate ni semua eh it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a budak yang belajar okinawan karate dengan japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm budak okinawa they will win cause orang jepun they also learn kata but dia punya kata and karate dia they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause untuk orang
korea punya
orang korea punya the way they fight bila when they practise
but orang jepun dia punya kata
the stands dia punya kuda-kuda dia is
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original punya martial arts fight is for
you ask them to fight each other yang long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan punya orang
come close to japanese punya
karate punya budak
dia akan blur dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin
okinawan punya karate will always win japanese punya karate
but the big but eh orang okinawa even though they are more relax dia punya gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
okinawa punya karate kan every class only maximum ten to fifteen people yang belajar
ah dia punya guru dia they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan punya karate lama-lama is dying out
but japanese punya karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class ada dalam hundred people
two hundred people tiga ratus orang belajar in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese punya karate-do
ah and also in ah in japan punya karate-do
but by right the original karate yang from okinawan one
that is the true essence of okinawan punya karate
ah tu
bezanya it's actually there's a lot of difference ah you can talk
three days three nights eh tiga hari tiga malam boleh
berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis cause it's actually the punya cerita is very interesting
apa eh
okay for singapore context eh aku nak percuma senang jer
cause healthcare dekat singapore yang paling mahal lepas tu
yang lain benda percuma is of course kereta dengan rumah lah rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal
orang budak-budak singapore ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah
yang dia orang boleh mampu uh mostly is that's the case lah lepas tu yang pasal
kereta of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
yang kau dah kasih orang lease for ten years engkau charge orang tu sampai hundred over thousand for a a normal car
carparks yang kita ada is tak cukup
apa barang free nak of course lah nak rumah kereta dengan healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare dah ada pernah personal experience ah kalau dekat singapore you do not have any insurance apa-apa jadi dengan you ah
bayar lah sendiri sampai pokai
kalau ada insurance boleh cover sikit at least duit tu boleh cari juga lah
boleh apa orang cakap ah termampu
kalau no insurance at all ah kena bayar pokai-pokai ah pandai-pandai lah hidup nak
what we do okay kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu
then zaman kegemilangan islam
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the khalifah punya empire
ada dibiayai lah oleh
so apa dia orang bikin
dia belajar um err
zaman-zaman rome punya punya buku-buku
they translate daripada latin pergi arab
in fact ah even the egyptian punya historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why kita banyak actually a lot of our
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually ah push ah macam all the
so kalau untuk zaman sekarang if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing lah we will explore untuk sekarang lagi kita ada we are very modernize
kita akan explore the space ah
ah just ah apa tu
kita manusia ni we we love to explore
we automatically learn a lot of new things lah macam gitu lah
ah repeat repeat soalan
work bukan activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity kalau activity
okay activity yang paling boring kan eh
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight tak boleh cause uh you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
mm kalau okay lah
cause why I every time I hungry kalau rumah tak ada makan I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
kira kan I don't do a lot of stuff
dekat luar I'm always at home so kalau
say about macam bad stuff no lah not really lah
kalau ada bad stuff mesti hidup pun I can't sleep at night also lah
kalau not really lah
I yang pasal ni I can't really say much lah ah ya
dia punya abs tu eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
dia jadi achilles achilles itu punya movie okay I like two movies ah in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is ah ni lah troy so that the difference
is actually pasal orang paling kuat achilles
mm in the end he died he have a choice actually kalau dia if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong lah
had eternal glory macam orang ingat dia
any normal egoistic man he actually uh it shows kita manusia especially man ah uh all
about this movie right about three hundred and ni ah troy is all the quotes that they used
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity itu word eh macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena
so it's it's about the same thing and also dalam
ah gambar-gambar macam achilles ni semua troy ni semua it's all the same thing it's their quotes eh you can actually bring it to real life and ikut lah so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out one lah
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is uh macam
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy yang
texts yang panjang-panjang semua
prefer texts yang macam
yang pendek-pendek short and sweet kirakan macam gitu yes summary and also mostly
thirty two tiga puluh dua tahun
tengah buat apa is it the O levels
apa eh actually seventeen
apa eh actually nak cakap err
actually kalau if I look back in my life right
kalau whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever lah I've been through um but kalau betul-betul nak advice of course lah um
cause at that time also kalau misal kata nak cakap oh you learn coding you learn all these app making right
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn sekolah poly that I learn is actually that was the
err orang yang ajar tu pun the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that err they are not that brilliant also
so if you ask me to macam you know to start a something new I don't think uh there will be good advice cause
microsoft mark zuckerberg ni semua eh the way they start kan is a really is all a downhill task lah
ah so cause also apa-apapun nak kena see
tujuh belas tahun really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned wah betul-betul uh benda baru
wah ni banyak boss semua cakap gini
you just be normal stuff ah five years' time eh okay kalau cakap pasal goals eh um
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like macam ada have that kind of materialistic punya goals
terus jadi billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing macam nak beli rumah besar
beli kereta besar all these I don't want cause benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat singapore we know that it won't last for cars
which one oh dia
I only eat waffle but then I'm so full babe what what do I have to do oh topik topik perbincangan
sekiranya anda

then yang majulah singapura pun
macam conductor ah wah I know three step only
dan mari kita three step jer dia itu
alright boleh
boleh eh okay so basically aku tanya uh whoever living at my place first to do this lah cause I thought need to do at my house
then I aku call siapa ham boy dengan uh I they technically live near my place what so easier so I call them dua dua tak nak buat
I actually oh my god I forgot to tell ham he told me uh dia nak fikir dulu
ah nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
no is based on macam first come first basis
okay basically err my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
sekali suddenly she just sent me this lah so I actually thought this was a debate
ah so aku so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I ah call you lah uh I was looking for people ah macam ham boy
actually one of my friend who stay kat
ah very near right tapi dia tak nak
like I don't I don't get some people punya mindset macam
tak kan satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
oh my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
ah actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want ah ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
ah always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
kita tukar question jer ah
tukar question
let me guess kau kene kerja for
settle down relax there K dah settled
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay lah tapi nak
commit and ah macam apa
ah but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita lah
six fifty nine I aku dah kat rumah
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
so they talk about the dulu orang Turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
uh rumah tangga
uh musuh
cucuk belakang and all ah oh my god I tell you
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class ah
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek kan two years in a row ah don't need study ah lepak ah
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class eh kita focus jer how to be best in the cohort
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
lepak kat luar lah ah tak belajar after oral
aku main catching
ah prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
past tak terjadi
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
yeah oh my god dorang punya cara berbual
some um country ah they you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
like dulu punya time ah
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
dia punya masalah yang betul kan is actually apa tau
life hidup
macam life is so simple
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
everyday activity lah bukan kerja ke apa macam K for me
nanti muak pe
and what jelak sama jer lah
eh kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi tau pasal sekolah
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
intuition that I can read people face so like I know oh muka gini ah gini ah orangnya
like oh muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini oh macam gini ah orang dia
so tak ah so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
I expected you to be a super mat rep
err perang perang kan
so actually alamak confirm mat rep eh fikir dia siapa sia
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the apa the headmaster apa
course head eh apa
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa hamizan tak ingat
what skill eh apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
I mean I heard of it before tapi macam
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu kan cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
then you know his uh dia punya cara marah macam mana kan see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
takde lah
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops lah ni lah tu lah ni lah tu lah
ah definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so I can them like bombard them
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
so aku macam oh my god
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa lah hidup macam ni
it's for me is merepek ah like I I can't believe ah macam
K ah kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly kan what what's the point
obviously ah kita macam you know what
kita punya pathway macam gini jer
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit jer
abeh kalau kat rumah I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
precisely I aku it is
I find it super merepek
so it it made me like oh you know what ah so tiring ah malas ah
ah tak leh ah tak leh ah
abeh come by my house lah one once in a while
eh kim cam
pergi pe ons see you in five minutes five minutes eh toa payoh to woodlands
why your apa engine so loud
yeah I never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit jer singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa ah
kalau kau tanya aku eh mm
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
if they give us like pre before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
kalau basketball oh definitely ah you need upper body strength ah but that means
like I pay for competition semua
izzul kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot eh sorry sorry sorry
no no no K basically in basketball kan kalau kau main
so my game and dorang punya game tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
tak kira apa-apa lah
you know because uh you have to understand in Singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
correct so parents aku suka apa tau they like err
air bahasa melayu apa ah
angin tu wind
oksigen ah ni dalam melayu properly ah eh
oksigen ah the proper the proper malay pronunciation for oxygen
G E N oksigen
kau punya okay ah let me see eh
then tak tahu dapat dorang punya salary ke tak
dorang punya families kat overseas macam mana
book reservation punya
kalau dorang buat ni eh kalau dorang buat ni kan
dorang punya tracking system pun senang tau actually you know what implement to all shops
dorang buat gini senang nak track orang
untuk orang turun dengan nak masuk kedai right
tapi satu masalah will be apa tau
okay lah playing sports and all is a different thing lah you need to you know move because like berapa hari lepas kan aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan
so I just need to get up I I so I went to play takraw kat serangoon sana
because kalau if kalau kita lepak kat luar
ah kalau korang kat rumah aku ke apa like we just do our own things
Italy they have a very big hit all this macam tourist attraction punya tempat eh very big hit
so kau masih kerja
eh tu nenek aku
I mean technically it's my sleeping time ah aku switch aku punya body clock
after asar to subuh
now is subuh to after isyak
okay apa ni kau punya time tinggal berapa
sixty mine is only fifty nine fifty seven okay lah I guess kita end the conversation now lah eh
so macam very boring you know and like some more all all my other friends like we want to meet up
if aku ada pagi punya kelas then she have petang punya kelas then if have if I have petang punya kelas then she have pagi punya kelas then it's like you really boring
lepas tu it's like how to say
it's very dry cause sekarang tak ada hands on cause of the COVID so kita tak ada jadi hands on activity
then I'm like central ada macam
uh childcare kat dalam kan tapi kita tak dapat pergi and we suppose to pergi so now it's like really dry and like err boring and all we do is like datang school lah habis kita tak buat apa-apa kita just do nothing we just like sit there and then we revise our own work
but then at the same time macam best sebab
dapat jumpa kawan pe
dapat jumpa kawan habis like
we go eat together sometimes tapi macam sometimes cause semua tinggal jauh-jauh so we cannot
do anymore but then college central still do but now because ah recently ada like COVID
case at college central so right we don't do anymore unless macam is online class tu pun online class we do like a lot of like projects like we research about the different type of sports and then we research about division of different type of muscles
habis lepas tu kita buat powerpoint slides about the muscles all lah
but ah then actually tak do like any like that is kalau kita buat macam project ni kan
it is counted as kita punya participation mark
so that is considered your exam marks so like sports and wellness we count that a lot somehow like we count that a lot lah from the projects that we do since we cannot do like real life cause we are supposed to learn like swimming rock climbing cause they all have like their facilities there but then we now kita tak boleh buat so we don't do anymore then we have like
I already took like test I think earlier this year cause we learn excel and then macam quite senang lah cause you just is given at basically it is given the answer is given like they ask you oh your chart must look look like you all like pivot table must look like that so it's actually given
but then cause just like you figure out how to do it so and then when we like in the weird thing kan pasal
each of the people can there's like uh over hundred like there's marks points but they don't tell you how much you get they just tell you pass or you fail and what's your final nanti kau your
kau dapat when nanti kau dapat tahu ah kau do like well ke tak then after that for my class like kan you can if you fail
or you like don't do so good kan you have the opportunity to retake your punya like test lah but then my class tak ada orang retake cikgu cakap like all did like quite okay all did quite good then I was like thankfully so we dah ketepikan tu dah lama diketepikan but then project went on like for a long time
like for a really long period of time I mean module tu macam cause very frustrating cause it has nothing to do with our course which is early childhood so nothing to do kan so you learn a lot more to macam business more like
options and like assumptions that why the company go back that kind of is more to that kind of stuff but then like we did our project and all but she never tell us like our final mark yet then life skill is more of like presentations like how you present yourself is more of how to say macam
uh in macam experience through experience cause we do a lot buat macam relationship management lepas tu kita buat the time kita buat like kita punya individual presentation kan it just
we in right this is the frustrating thing ah cikgu just go just go through
cikgu just go through mana part yang kita nak ada buat assignment one dia orang tak ajar like throughout macam in secondary school they ajar everything what even if like those tested only a bit right they go through everything with you but then in like you need to go through it yourself and then sometimes the information and dia orang bagi pun
uh is not correct so you have to search online about that kind of stuff and then you have to remember like cause in early childhood is more of like you have to memorise a lot of things like kenapa budak ini nangis then kenapa ah dia tak eh separate dengan parents jer then uh what kind of symptoms
so macam a bit dry it's very dry
business writing is more to macam you write emails letters
then is easier in a way because ada multiple choice
twenty out of thirty you should get cause teachers said is like a giveaway mark but then yang section yang lain cause you have essay and all that kind of stuff so that's like the
we are like like you said lah this is just semester one it feels like we have been in school for like a long time like we entered like april oh we entered april but like it's it's like we have been in the school for like a year then we still we forgot some if we forget that sometimes like macam how to say
individual task now then you are going to take off our exam then our holiday which is only two weeks we cannot even go tak boleh pergi mana-mana sebab COVID
tak yang mana eh tak boleh keluar sedih and then but then like it's all like we just want to like finish the exam and get it over with cause it's
tak boleh keluar cause mana-mana pergi tak ada duit
so mana nak pergi kalau tak ada duit kan
and then like ni then can think about like other stuff
but they want to tanya you to continue this course like in poly so it's very hard
do like I I I just like to get it over with macam
senang kan kalau kau
aku like I can do bila-bila aku nak I can do any time I want and I'm the type that I want it to be like
macam I'm a I'm a bad person lah I that really really die die I want it to be like perfect like near perfect I want it be like
like cause I there are I've grouped with like there is a lot of like banyak gila is the amount of like group projects right is banyak is like until like every week you tukar group you've just tukar tukar tukar constantly you tukar cause cikgu first of all like
the reason they give is because sebab apa cikgu nak kita meet
work with people they want dia orang nak tengok how
speak english or like other ada apa language from overseas then you will be sent overseas that kind of stuff so they want to see how you are
macam mana kau boleh cope dengan working with other people
kalau aku group yang dengan kawan aku aku sangat frustrated tau
cause I'm the type that okay just get it over with like when you I don't cause I'm also like very noisy aku macam noisy playful naughty but when I do work I just want to do work that I I realise that's my attitude like when I doing work right I just want to like get it done macam complete ah cepat habis cepat kau pergi relax cepat kau pergi like
one corner kau there duduk kau boleh cikgu pun orang bila cikgu bagi time kat kelas untuk buat project kau just duduk jer apa habis tidur
like that kind of stuff but then like almost this semester almost like semua my project kan is die like hujung hujung last minute submit like eh but eh is good work lah we are able to provide good work but it's still
depends banyak dengan who you work with
honestly like there are people that cannot work together ada like yang they are mm
people it matters what my friends like girl friend but I cannot work with them like I cannot work with one guy in my classmates name ima cause he just talk malay cause he macam he's really a perfect
honestly banyak orang cakap is easy in a way it depends they are some courses
banyak yang senang like
senang for you to masuk senang for you to complete senang for you to get a good grade even the teachers admit that if your classmate macam kau yang classmate bo chup like serious like
tak buat kerja kan I mean kau do kerja yang you are given kau boleh dapat A even though gonna work is like so bad
eighteen nineteen seventeen for O level they end up there just because mostly is because of math cause we are very weak in math and then early childhood pun tak ada mana kau perlu ajar math kau ajar one two three four five under ten pun sudah okay dah you are set for life in that career in that sense lah
like because of that guy and people tend to look down so macam
but then macam what they never think is that
really competitive you know like the other type that macam every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada soalan every lesson ada like macam oh
they like the macam
they really think about their ranking a lot lah macam I know that some macam
my friend sawar she hasn't really think about ranking lah but she's clever but rela also clever but she also don't think about ranking macam kita
sorry to say but melayu more relax lah
kita macam more like okay tak apa kalau pass pass kalau fail fail gitu tapi we try hard
tapi macam there are a lot more other races macam they are very keen on
macam competing macam hardcore gila ni semua kan so to me there's no maybe is going at a slower pace than poly because what we are learning is what year ones are learning ah but we are learning it break we break up
more slower in a sense kita boleh more slow but
because I'm used to like I'm the type of person like in secondary school macam aku dah fail fail fail fail fail lepas tu bila kat the end aku macam okay pass macam I made it jelita bah cause I I do set expectation that are high
in it's all about okay every time must be good results and it's like the pressure is mounting up macam
I aku rasa macam very like less freedom cause like continuously like okay everyday I have assignments submit by this submit by that submit by this like even though like I have more assignments than some of my even poly friends like they are more chill they relax actually
senang jer macam gitu then I'm just like oh my god why is this so stressful I was like cause I think that was my mistake
aku go into thinking that macam
senang like ni like it will be nak very easy
but anyway I was inside already like first two weeks first week of school it kill me like okay because no orientation because you straight go into our assignment which drove me like crazy I was like okay I need to find a kid I need to find a kid takkan tell me budak tapi tak nak observe budak tu lepas tu I nak tanya write report pasal budak tu then I'm just like oh my god I cannot do this
but dia orang ingat like macam ni senang cause kau jaga budak jer pe kau jaga budak kau budak tu mak dia tinggalkan budak tu kat kau habis kau jaga jaga but actually
we watch how the budak grow
like how he is doing cause sometimes cikgu yang responsible for like the early childhood of the child the more the responsible is to see if there's a problem with your child developmental wise cause by certain age
like you know we grow up right we grow up knowing nothing then kita okay just besar macam okay lah by this age dah cakap actually there's a
oh I look back my slides right I'm learning ah I'm like tengah revise jer aku macam apa yang aku tengah belajar ni apa kena mengena ni dengan budak-budak and we revise okay that's actually link kita belajar pasal brain then kita faham okay which budak pakai which part of the brain when they are doing this budak pakai then we are just like oh my god we are just learning like
seniors mereka cakap from the first year
kau boleh tahu how hard it's gonna be for the next year
then it's obviously kau dah tahu like you are like
macam it is and there are some poly kids they go into early childhood in poly eh tak tahu apa-apa they don't know anything about budak-budak you don't know anything like
some people even like masuk early childhood they don't even like kids that much cause it's just early childhood is how macam early childhood has
so end up you jadi cikgu atau jadi principal more of that but then
it it is a very stable job cause obviously that job is not gonna that job cannot be taken by robots that kind of stuff so it is a very stable job everybody's gonna like end up like being a teacher so macam that stability is what people want in life kan
dia orang nak duit dia orang nak macam ni but that they don't pay a lot they don't really pay a lot you know in the sense that they do not pay a lot but the stability that
for the next few years kau ada job untuk dapatkan they focus on that then a lot of my classmates they want to go university there are already thinking even up when they start thinking okay aku nak pergi uni from my mind is like okay I know I'm in but do you want to go to uni
I want to I don't know initially memang aku nak baca psychology
that how a child thinks it can further my career in a sense but it's also what I'm interested in but I haven't decide macam belum decide kalau aku nak kerja ke atau aku nak sekolah macam I'll pass macam how to say ah
poly obviously I aku tak nak just stop at like I want to learn more there's a lot more things that I can learn at poly I know that and then
my friend said that in every like I was macam very when dapat pergi kan you are very saddened at the fact that you go cause when your end goal is poly but then my friends said that apa tu once in your lifetime you must experience life
like everybody like is that kind of stuff and you will have a lot of things do but sekarang COVID so kita tak ada buat semua tu tapi we still have like
like just a few week days ago last week we like before our exam like our teacher brought like some snacks and she brought she bawa nintendo switch jer pergi class ah semua orang main just dance is like that kind of thing
all of us want to go poly semua nak pergi poly kita punya ultimate goal is poly
macam bila kau kat first day
dia orang tanya kau like um
then like I think about like ninety percent not hundred percent said they want to go poly and then you see okay ngee ann temasek ngee ann temasek that kind of stuff bah banyak orang cakap dia nak pergi twenty percent want to pursue uni psychology
macam susah tapi that
bila aku tengok semakin aku cakap okay memangnya it's gonna be hard cause there's so much people there's forty people in this room but then like
that's obviously true lah then macam very susah then I see you learn by laju so aku dah macam
oh my god I cannot take this aku macam dah stress I remember ah me thinking that when I do my assignment like oh my god is already so stress aku dah stress gila masa buat assignment aku tak boleh like sometimes kalau kau message aku aku tak reply apa-apa aku just macam
I cannot do this aku tak boleh aku tak boleh aku nak focus like I not everybody when like it's my assignment I just like do my work
how am I supposed to adapt into poly I mean the transition macam I think itu yang susah transitions to secondary and tertiary life cause it's
totally opposite cause in kat ah secondary school all these are the teacher untuk guide kau like okay kau nak buat ni kau nak buat ni okay kau nak submit kan ni kau nak submit kan tu in kalau kau tak nak submit cikgu macam eh kenapa kau tak buat submit
ah kau nak submit tau next time tapi dia dia orang tak remind kau they don't remind you they didn't like teach you everything in that okay ada exam make sure belajar tu jer aku macam what the hell aku macam come on man like
adaptation is how you are ah adapt let me ah I think most people tak nak it's understandable kalau kau tak nak
cause kalau kau dah badly adapt poly right kenapa tu like you kau tak macam you cannot get used to
macam I know ah focus a lot in group work
also I think everyday every thursday is our presentation day every thursday then now change every day like every assignment like macam cikgu ajar one chapter okay by next by tomorrow submit your slides then by this day we gonna present
I cannot I think that's the thing I need sufficient time to study I'm the I'm a very slow learner lah macam you have to admit I'm a very slow learner I'm good at language language macam mother tongue
your english you need to at least get a B somehow because language is very important macam but then now they are making like macam oh mother tongue punya base preschool semua kan but it's still english very important
cause like at one point you realise that a lot of your learning is due to rephrase the words macam there are some things about ah what we learn about like theory psycho analytic theory this kind of stuff is where there's super ego and then like ego that kind of stuff is where we learn how like you know like there's macam kat movie
like macam devil and angel right that's like a real theory and then we learn okay how it affects children
punya like thinking how they make decisions macam mana then macam oh budak ni
like is like macam evil not evil lah
is what you truly desire then how to say super ego is the one that influence you to make good decisions in ego is the one that is making the decisions so these two person are just influencing then macam ah when we realised that it's hard macam susah
serious susah bila aku kat muka sekarang kadang-kadang hujung just tidur I cannot take it aku macam kelas pukul lapan we start at eight and we finish at five and it's back to back classes I don't have a lot of breaks in my class how could I text I don't have a lot of breaks
kita back to back classes
then you get very tired get very tired and you there's more information that can go inside your brain then when you go back home right you macam I think the
macam kau punya record senang kau record like how to say that time aku the whole way aku tidur like it was like two hour class I just sleep the whole way through I off my camera and off my mic then I slept
then there always there's someone in the class that always record and send it to the group so that's a good things so aku tengok balik recording okay macam okay now we have to mix and match that kind of stuff macam keeping balik cause it's very hard to concentrate online class
it's no matter how like late your class is right I just sleeping is like more better like kau tidur jeng kau nak nanti kau bangun kau cakap okay fine
it's just seriously hard oh you know macam now is
now like macam honestly okay at eighteen right ah when I turn eighteen of my birthday I did a video call with my friends
I have a older friend right aqilah kan a year older then dia she tell me macam tegur aku lah
what kind of people you want to mix around with kalau orang mana yang kau mahu dekat dengan
cause biasalah cause in like in religious terms we cannot cut out anybody but still
and eighteen kan kau obviously kawan kau bukan semua ada boyfriends kan sekarang jer kan oh ajak kawan ada they're going out dia orang keluar kat boyfriend dia orang lepas tu dia orang go to the beach even kat COVID COVID ni dia orang text sahaja it's just like ugh I want that I want that but there's no one to have that with but I want that
then like it's how you deal with that situation macam okay kau nak boyfriend tapi kau tak dapat kau nak buat apa are you gonna be like sad but I mean now I I don't know I'm not sad I'm more like okay lah kau tak ada boyfriend
that's why I relax macam okay now I realise you know macam ninety percent of my friends that you macam
my close friend lah macam kau aqilah megan they prioritise studying over anything else they prioritise like how to say like or guys studies
that kind of stuff and then the I realise maybe hada you know she has macam ada boyfriend sekarang kan
takes a lot of decision tau cause kau one year kau nak pergi mana kawan kau semua nak moving along with your life what dia orang tengah kerja dia orang tengah belajar dia orang tengah getting uh upgrading yourself in a way lah then kau nak you won't have a lot of people to spend time with you
betul tak unless you have boyfriend lah but then your boyfriend also studying then what you gonna do
it's different ke so it's college lah so she can work after NAFA but she wants take a break
cause me megan aqil kita plan lagi
ke korea belajar
then we're just like come on hada then she just said kita tak nak
she she doesn't kita tak nak how to say dia nak take a break dia tak nak continue belajar cause I don't think she prioritise
we we are scared to admit but ya we are we we would choose our education over guys kita macam okay kita macam single sedih kan cause sedih tak ada boyfriend
sedih dan lain-lain but
if a guy tells me that my biggest turn off in a guy kan is bila dia bilang aku jer tau dia tak tahu apa nak buat into the future
I don't like aku macam god you need a plan dude you plan your life you need
to get a job you need to like come on like dia nak kena get dia life straight I like I find guys like macam tahu what they are doing in life right very attractive first
susah kalau nak like okay mm we are young so we are supposed to experience a lot of stuff we macam get it lah but then macam we
who you are in life you know macam eh sekarang ni school decision um aku selalu cakap tau oh tapi some people doesn't mean determine who we are who you are oh I'm like
like cause my okay my my parents in a sense they don't really macam put pressure sometimes they do but I kind of understand but top that
and then but the but then macam to me kan the
the aku punya pressure towards myself is lebih besar
so at the end of day kan I'm scared of the disappointing myself you know because macam kau already
macam let's say I aku ada a lot of thing spent untuk diri aku aku ada like a lot of
I actually single best gila sebab kau first of all aku boleh tidur pukul berapa aku nak
like aku boleh tidur pukul sembilan pukul lapan siang
how to say aku tak sangat
aku tak nak lelaki yang macam sticks around all the time
I don't like that I don't like macam macam I have seen a lot of my friends banyak bagi tahu aku apa everyday kau everyday jumpa
macam kau okay kau tak ni macam kau tak rimas kau aku tengok kau aku rimas tau
macam I cannot cause I have I like hanging out with my friends I like hanging out with my friends I like doing things like cause like ah you know I'm crazy right when I watch something I binge watch it like then I can watch like five episode of like criminal minds in one day then I'm like ugh like come on like that crime the passion you know that kind of stuff but then like how to say like
bila kau dah seorang eh
kau ada banyak freedom you know kau you can do a lot of things because now banyak of my friends that break up they are like oh my god
single is fun but after two months they're like oh my god I can't believe you have been single for two years then aku macam aku tak nak kan saya lelaki aku macam ah you know macam my life has been fun all this while
I feel like even if kalau aku dalam relationship kan I would take it very slow
cause obviously aku nak date for long term
apa yang kau nak in life like is it a need or is it a want
I feel I I want a boyfriend but I'm not gonna die if I don't have it cause I'm fine now like aku tak ada boyfriend tau macam
most of last most of my last time my friends ada contact kan can go back with aku akan text macam balik punya eh ya aku balik macam but then when ah I go back home alone
I feel fine apa I feel like okay I'm fine I can sleep bro tak ada tak ada orang cakap dengan aku aku jer tidur jer janganlah aku tidur aku boleh tengok tiktok like the whole way home I'm just watching like tiktok and nobody disturb me
that kind of stuff kalau aku nak pergi aku lapar aku nak pergi makan
then I'm just I just call my friend that okay kau nak you nak makan tak the I the best thing is aku tak payah minta not minta macam aku tak payah macam
like worried keluar dengan kawan lelaki boyfriend aku macam marah eh kenapa keluar dengan lelaki like I can be friends with whoever I want like literally like no doubt you are free but in a sense bila kau dah free for too long
tunggu macam how to say ah
first of all you learn to love yourself back kenapa macam cause girls highly like not just girls even boys sometimes bila dia orang break up eh dia orang kena dump they think that macam somehow ah what's wrong with me berapa muka soalan kau kan tang is like kenapa aku then you have to over that
like time where you like okay aku ni okay actually it's just everyone around me that's shit
kau just macam build up on yourself lah
aku faham ah in a way and then
cause fikir banyak pasal orang sibuk sangat pasal orang tapi tak fikir sendiri sendiri
then bila now I'm thinking like at the end of the day kau seorang jer during this pandemic I spend a lot of time jer I think I spend the most time with you during the pandemic
like bila aku dengar anything I have this habit of like using my phone even when with my family cause aku just nak text all the time then sekarang macam I like brother and my sister they were sick ah what earlier this year so when they go out they always don't want to be ask like
so they always want to have private they want to call girlfriend malam call boyfriend calling ni kau tu
family is important to me macam I think because I grew up
me and my siblings grew up separately so we all came together kan kita macam really emphasise my dad my dad really like
how happy I was when I was with them thing macam
my family is a type macam
kau nak faham like kawan friendship semua
macam is not
anytime boleh end
walaupun kau rapat kadang-kadang eh
kau boleh end kan tapi family kau will always be there with you and you need to understand because kau dah besar you are adult
adult you know macam
aku sekarang I'm eighteen right you don't stop me but I still ask their permission when I want to go out like can I do this can I do that I still ask permission and they still like I don't mind sometimes my mum used to have this family link like macam ah she she like how to say
location ah phone kita like she can switch off she can like switch off our phone
but then like but the way you have to install it cause she recommended my mum have a best friend right she recommend it to her friend but her friend was not happy her friend was like kenapa kau nak lock phone aku macam that kind of vibe you know then bila kita the way my mum install it on our phone right
my mum just macam how to say
my mum just like ah give me touch you punya phone
then kita kena bagi like my siblings just like macam uh tanya like they never ask
aku aku reply aku macam kalau mak aku minta aku phone I aku macam tak tanya aku macam tak ada benda nak hide
I have nothing to hide so aku just bagi
kenapa main kenapa cause he's always playing game
so dia macam very agitated tau so macam
and then macam kita dapat balik kita macam okay and lepas tu she lock our phone like at certain times and when we want to download stuff you have to ask her that was in sec five you know cause it was last year
that wasn't like what tu bukan masa aku muda-muda tau tu last year tau sasha knew about this like apa tu
and then after that she always like lock kita punya phone semua kan then habis tu when family time she lock off kan I was like but we don't ever feel macam
cause like and macam kalau you
that app kan kalau kau pakai more than eight hours kan dia orang lock kau punya phone tu kau tak boleh buka so maximum is eight hours I've never gotten my phone lock cause aku sahaja I spend a lot of time with my family and my friends
I spend tak tau it charge charge semua pasal kita just macam bond banyak-banyak bond
so macam aku I never had that problem
and my sister had more for a few times and then she was okay with it kita tak pernah marah kita macam bila app tak ada kan then we understand now kenapa
naturally now kan kita spend a lot of time together a lot kita tak on the phone kita macam I say to my mum
I have to sleep early today then I don't watch movie like this year during the COVID we watch like the whole harry potter series as a family like every night kita watch the harry potter series as a family macam
uh like at eight after my that eight eh like all on my apa dia off day kita just duduk habis kita tengok harry potter like kami pun tu nangis nangis hujung gila pun macam kau orang mati macam it's that kind of vibe you know then macam but when I spend a lot of time with cousins kan I realise that their families are different
macam they don't really tak kisah sangat pasal family dia orang say
okay aku dah besar pe okay like now what eighteen
kenapa nak spend a lot of time with family
shazlin dia family tak pakai baju raya dia matching tau
dia beli sendiri so pakai different colour ah but my family is like every year like we sit down and we talk about it was like my sister always want pink eh
my brother always want blue then my dad want black but we'll always decide okay satu colour jer
then we buy like same colour and it same with macam makan tau like it's like puasa right we all like put
our suggestion in a bowl then that she picks up every day then she read out then she's like okay today I pick out like we do that every year but we do never complete cause every night ah last day usually last week kan kita banyak makan take out like my dad will bring us all out we had that tradition then bila aku macam spend a lot time macam
with other people and aku realise like I'm lucky in a sense that way cause my family is very close
they dia orang tak macam
dia orang tak macam forbid
but they are like they advise you need to understand they my mum always told me my mum always cakap why do you want to have a boyfriend you are so much more you want accomplish why do you want to be tied down
a lot so macam my mum is like don't want do that then I just talk to them freely like if I have even friends' problem I talk to my mum very freely I talk to my dad then my dad give me advice even education like macam every time I'm moving on to another school or another part of my life I always I always discuss with them I'm I want to do this

that's the thing so tak kan nak kasi macam kawan kita datang abeh dorang tak dapat makan seh it's not a buffet get it that's the part that they're not they don't understand
yang yes fine I can put them as crew macam like so that you get more seats but they won't get to eat lah because they are not itu pe a'ah the food is only fifty pax what
hais so tu lah a'ah I just ignore abeh after that dia tak tanya she didn't ask me but dia tak tanya macam directly after that bila dia delete like she didn't ask me my mum ah

ya lah just kalau ah tu kalau orang tak bilang pun nanti semua macam lost
dia cakap dia cakap boleh aku boleh emcee tapi um suara aku tak sedap lah nanti aku bawa sham sekali eh kalau kau tak kesah aduh
dia menggigil nanti mata kelip-kelip mata dia err err err err aku tak tahu ah err aku tak tahu ah apa nak cakap
tak because ya nevermind ah just kita just takpe tak kesah on the day itself boleh tengok just see actually all these things nak kena tanya can you just write it down the things that we need to ask like what time we can come in to start prepping like cause the cake semua nak kena datang
ya so just can you just can you just write down first but it's christmas I think mesti ada event nya yang masuk
ya like when can we come in cause we also need to plan apa someone need to come in to look look see see first siapa syafiq
awak ya ya
ya actually awak can come with me jap you mak awak terus awak dah tak payah worry about is it
actually awak kalau nak you can come from the hotel also lah
entah but the this is kita belum halal nanti kalau orang tengok awak tengok saya macam tak pakai tudung macam weird
tak or you you just wait at home first bila macam about ada timing lah so make sure saya dah pakai a'ah dah pakai tudung and all that
ya then you meet me at the hotel baru kita datang sama-sama lah I mean ya I mean we will just gonna I don't know ya the thing is because dia cakap we have from seven to ten abeh dia cakap kalau bridal use the room but we also don't have much time before that what
mm not enough time lah nak makeup
ya ya biar lah I don't think nak kena tanya mak andam juga ni like like will you follow me uh to the venue or tak ya cause kalau tak dia buat kat rumah then lepas tu dia jalan pe
pak andam usually is your brides man what eh brides man groomsman
alah kalau gitu rizal tahu lah
a'ah rizal dengan syam rizal dengan syam semua buatkan hafiz pe
actually syam syam yang bagus benda gini syam yang bagus
syafiq tak tahu ke
actually saya tahu tapi tak kan saya nak ikat awak
ikat pun boleh ikat sendiri pe
tapi saya saya pun tahu dulu malay dance pun kita belajar benda ni semua cause kita pun pakai apa a'ah kita pun pakai samping pe kan ah malay dance pun kadang-kadang our costumes we have to wear the samping kita semua belajar pe buat flower and all that I was talking just ask the person to teach lah but it will be weird lah kalau bride ikatkan samping
but the thing is if the thing is kan when mak if mak andam is there dia boleh siapkan awak juga pe if you come to the hotel room
tapi mak andam nak siap lelaki I don't know
ee tak payah lah
I think ya I think it's part of the package awak pun nak kena is it awak kena tiga kan
tengok lah tengok my mum suruh
takpe I tengok kalau dia tanya kak kau nak pakai inai ke tak tak yah lah ah okay lah ah kalau dia macam gitu okay kalau dia cakap eh kau merepek pakai lah inai ah then tu makna terpaksa
tak perlu lah hafiz pun tak pakai
and lepas tu ada lain benda ah ah pasal yang food serving
ya cause after nikah nikah selalu berapa lama fifteen minute twenty minute
mm tak ah ambil gambar jer lah abeh lepas nikah dah ambil gambar
doa ada doa kena doa bismillah gitu
okay lah so so fine eight thirty nanti uh the thing is actually kita dah short of time tau
ya nak ambil gambar orang nak ambil gambar kita
ya abeh kita tak makan ah
sekejap ah like the last ah last last eh we are photo taking tiga puluh minit sudah eh
ah okay okay so okay so awak take note err for lepas nikah kita cakap the food is served at eight thirty walaupun apa jadi just serve jer because it's gonna be on the table jer kan
ya so so just eight thirty a'ah macam eight thirty eight thirty gitu okay start serving lah like once once dorang dah they feel like nikah tu dah is okay to make noise already then they can just go
tak lah
tak kesah lah kita nak makan we still need to cake cut okay
like okay dengar dengar dengar that's why I say ya we'll go by table that's why I say biar let them serve the food after this lepas nikah lepas tu okay just ask rizal to okay um now the food while the food is served we will go table by table to take pictures eh like each person ah
ah but first of course our parents first ah ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue ah so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan jer ah like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first kan selalu cake cut is the first kan
ya ke
eh okay lah okay lah okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut kan together with the berkat kan okay okay so oo but I need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak ah plastic okay lah macaron plastic okay lah
macam macam yang kopi ke tak kopi punya ah itu okay tak lah on macaron ya allah macaron
tak itu itu nanti saya suruh siti siti siti bagus siti kan baker
ah tu yang nanti siti nanti suruh siti tolong anokan
ya so eight thirty makan table by table take photo and then once we done we join bila kita dah habis blah blah
baru kita cake cutting cake cut okay dah jalan-jalan dah
so table by table kita makan by the time should be nine thirty lah tak kan kita makan lama sangat ada chance pun saya pun macam tak terasa nak makan a'ah lepas tu suruh dorang bungkus makan
shouldn't be lah kalau pergi table by table should be tak terlepas ah
I think so confirm rizal sabo nya dia mesti sabo punya like uh korang ada apa words to each other oh okay we both have a few words conjointly rizal kau irritating okay dah dah siap eh okay then something else I want to ask lah something else I wanted to ask the venue but I forgot ya lah yang pasal deejay tu are they giving cause dia cakap remember yang pasal spotify cakap just give us and then we will play it for you
oh ya okay okay so so can kita lupa pula nak tanya pasal tu sound board ah you tanya dia like who is is someone manning the sound board supposed to be from our side or you want your person to jaga your sound board
ya so so just ask him kalau tak takpe I just standby hafiz hafiz nanti kau pergi
wait eh nanti nanti ya it's just fade down fade up actually kalau rizal boleh buat pun rizal boleh buat sendiri jer bila dia nak berbual just fade down sendiri lepas tu dia berbual bila dia dah habis dia off mic lepas tu dia pergi ah lepas tu dia pergi balik to the sound board to just ah macam fade up lagu sikit ke ya atau actually awak boleh set kan on the board auto fade down
a'ah then awak buat itu jer tapi nanti dorang tak kasi eh kalau tukar setting nampak macam yang kecil punya macam yang

ya lah awak nak cakap cakap ah
ee banyaknya
dia cuma nak duit jer buat apa nak talk to dia buat fifty fifty fifty right technically it's including am dia ikut pe
tapi memang nak kena gitu kalau dah invite banyak you need to engage an ambassador to make sure that everyone is ya it's better to have rather than nanti everyone all standing at there in front and then kena saman might as well you hire an ambassador to make sure everyone is abiding with the safe entry rule ya lah
dia boleh buat cuma siapa nak jaga macam shah ibrahim easy dia hire an ambassador that's his way tapi kita ah bila kita buat siap nak
oo I remember the question that I want to ask tukang ambil temperature
tak but ya siapa yang jaga is it our people or his people
ah just ask awak just ask put down and just ask jangan I think I think nanti saya datang eh don't have anyone ya it's err you need to ask someone from your side to do it barangkali banyak gitu pe
I don't think so cause dia tak minta dia tak kesah kalau submit name I think hotel hotel yes macam restaurant ke
I ya we really need someone to jaga the tempat seh I think rahmat have to do it I think rahmat have to do it jaga-jaga macam nanti orang datang oh cik eh cik duduk kat sini eh cik duduk kat situ eh atau atau beforehand beforehand kita buat allocation and then we update them okay you be seated at table what table what that's why we need I put I put first thirty first october is their last date to so first november kita confirm everything we assign wherever and then we can send out like send again lah macam their confirmed punya table if any changes please let us know beforehand so we can make necessary changes and all that
then wait nanti after merisik I think um the week saturday we can send out the invitation lah
can merisik is on fourth october which is sunday then the following saturday can send out the invitation so we got one week to print out whichever siapa-siapa yang awak nak kasi the hard copy then we can print out
I will I share with you ah eh got google this I dah buat schedule perangai perangai production manager cause I'm like I tengok I need to see the dates huh
ya that's why now I use mine ah I already apa apply eh pakai twenty four hours tu ya I already put it so nanti on the card ya I will just tell them to search my name ah
because when I search I dah try I signed out from YouTube and then I try searching my name just nice keluar everything mine right my account
tak I actually don't know how it works ah
I just for me pakai for me just use laptop camera can already but you awak yang nak
biar ah bukannya kita nampak it's the screen is going to be so small we're gonna be far away from the laptop
okay lor so it means you what you're trying to say is the camera tak payah like be connected to the laptop
eh besok awak kerja kan
mana tahu sometimes you go site you take a while what
entah lah
tapi fajr takut dengan mak dia mak dia marah dia diam dia ni tak dia ni jawab balik
cannot ah mesti have to dorang nak kena takut takut they need to know the consequences of their wrongdoing macam zurai tak pukul langsung
ya lah ya pukul just to dorang rasa dia punya pahit ah macam ow
nak kena sakit sikit jer
I I tengok terus I tertidur
tapi ya lah like let's same ah like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya lah dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap ah biar ah dorang lelaki
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners ah like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam wow a man ya tu ah
or is it it comes from the western ah so orang tengok macam gitu kan
the children the the children will tengok at how their parents are ah nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
it's no lah sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
I think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show lah kasi like give and take
tak sayang ah tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know I saw I read something like I think we should do it lah when we get married dia cakap tak I read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner a'ah then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date a'ah lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit ah you will macam you will refresh your dating days a'ah so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle ah so at least diam eh ya so that so I think it's a very good advice seh macam I think ya it's it's it ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak lah don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere lah
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke a'ah just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food ah pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating jer huh ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure ah tapi susah because I think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap kan dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that kan macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
ah lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so ah suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah lah with the wife
nanti balik ah imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah lah tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak syafiq eh ayah what time already
tak lah dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak jer dengan kita jer nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri
I definitely eat rendang
rendang actually that's a good question why tau because
I selalu makan rendang
hari raya but then mak mak
mak always masak like anytime she wants
so when she everytime masak I everytime makan and I love the taste of rendang
so I makan everyday ah
dua bulan makan rendang straight
maybe for my breakfast example then maybe petang makan with roti then malam makan dengan noodle
ya lah ketupat is the best lah definitely
you put serunding oof
actually kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan noodles and like
you had lemak cili api pasta
sedap je lah cakap
sendu lain lah
macam step know it all ah
kirakan the big shot ah
people yang ego
so macam
I just can't stand kalau orang nak macam nak step besar ah nak step orang yang nak step I really just cannot
kirakan dia champion ah kirakan dia champion
more better lebih baik
then hidup tak ada objective
tak ada makna ya because for example if someone
work in terms of because orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu
ya so macam
ah so macam buang masa ah hidup
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed banyak banyak industry he dah masuk he fail banyak
and then after the dia dah buat the apprenticeship dengan tattoo artist dia buka kedai dia sendiri
at forty five and kedai dia successful
you rasa you
dah puas with the thing you buat kan
if not sampai bila bila pun kan you tak akan
dapat that this is the life that I want
all that thing yang you dah explore remain inside your body
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff kan you know I did all traditional stuff
and susah untuk kita nak
that society punya ape tu what do you call it requirement
yeah you go first ah I tak tahu apa nak
because melayu always masak with agak agak
so it's nice when it's agak agak
I want the rendang italian
mana-mana ah
my most memorable meal was your macaroni goreng
your macaroni goreng
and we ate dekat stadium
dekat lantai because we like we just that time I think that was the first few dates that we had kan
like you just cook macaroni goreng for me and then kita duduk dekat
right dekat stadium punya entrance
and then we just sat there and people were like taking bicycle around lari lah apa lah buat exercise lah
we wanted to go kallang wave mall and lepak dekat waterfront punya tempat tu
zaman bila kita pergi ice-skating
I tak ingat lah
I tak ingat
I think so eh no kallang wave mana ada movie
ni hundred need to lookout ya you can see it it's gonna be huge
imagine you get you a hundred lipas ee
yeah yeah kan I cakap
rendang because that's what I deserve
so so you rejected my rendang answer but you gave me kari ayam
apa sia get ignorance
all my punya members lah and even my friends
they say when I masuk dalam bilik
makan oho
if I nak pilih satu eh
you pilih dulu ah I think I know yours
yes please there's another outlet kan
I thought dah buka
somewhere in the west eh or center I tak ingat I know it's not in the east
a'ah seh sedap seh itu
muak because of the cheese dalam dia punya daging
sekarang nak masuk airport leceh ah
buat lawak eh
you doa lah I got car
try kalau pergi changi airport parah baby
because changi airport punya car park kan
so kalau kita gi Shake Shack boleh makan kasi habis five minute okay ah
yours is yellow kan
apa good energy
apa superpower itu
I would say the power to control my kentut without having stomachache
orang nampak me
you know what's a death note kan
which avatar yang botak ke yang biru
oh yang botak eh
tak ada tak ada backup on that statement just because dia budak botak you tak suka
dia macam Ipin with power
badang stuff
ya then then I tak gi mana mana ah
you tak keluar eh
you tak keluar jugak eh
I thought you say you dah catch up already
tomorrow confirm if keluar ramai orang seh
dia makan taugeh macam makan keropok
after she wash right while she's cooking and waiting for the other things to siap right she just take the taugeh and put inside her mouth like is potato chip
rosak eh the lidah
that time yang you buat kan
but that one the dashyat
dia dashyat gila punya lah masin
percussion tu main music
if you minum Boost you kenyang
so you minum Boost yang besar punya that time I always like drink Boost for my dinner
in the morning I eat all the normal normal stuff then malam I just like
sebat Boost jer
macam waste of money
iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus ah
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang eh sorry iphone pro eh iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
oh so I think tengok tempat dia plan jer lah tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs ah
hmm tengok benefit benefit dia
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
ya ya our saudara
alamak drill ah buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu uh you plan to take which plan
tu full price ah no contract ah
oh actually iphone seven also not bad tapi I I would suggest iphone eight ah because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone ah
I think tu paling terbaik lah kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough ah
ya so that one that time was during COVID kan so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya lah sebab COVID kan so not to get more consumer to buy the phone lah at a cheaper price ya
even ah android phone pun sama lah like google the new google apa pixel kan they they make it cheaper lah but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang lah compared to the previous one ya
must check the new iphone right jap eh let me check eh
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
ya they are still selling I mean um you must check you must check takpe ah ustaz tengah check
takpe ah ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
iphone X eh iphone X jap jap jap there's a face iphone
oh our ni eh parents eh
I think biasa ah mum is sleeping then I think bapak baru balik ya and
ah bapak kerja ah dekat ni lah iya dia kerja ni lah hari ni kerja pe hari ni hari rabu kan
tak lah I think he working three times a week
tu I think paling penting ah so like macam nanti um once I've started working
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
apa start started working kan you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing kan so you need to
for coding ah ya so basically it's not that hard lah because really we can just uh search up in the in the apa
ya ya some some some apa some company kan they
they know ah whether you you've you search online ke tak lah cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important ah it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice ah you need to really improve on it ah then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered lah by the company
jangan kena pijak ah gitu
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
uh full time ke part time
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation kan macam
tapi N level start sama time eh dengan O level
tapi ah the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya COVID dia orang ambil O level december apa this COVID kat
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically ah system engineer lah you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni lah
software engineer ke if
macam mana nak spell F O R T L A N
apa skills ah like
for example apa eh okay name like
I think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart eh dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang eh golang
like owned by google ah so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
yang tengah ah siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager kan the apa uh the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan kan this apa
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
abeh sekarang like ah
you know macam COVID pun is getting better kan singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border kan to singapore kan macam only for those yang business
ah green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana kan dia orang boleh ya for us I think we can't ah sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti kan
actually boleh balik ah because technically she is ni kan she is not singaporean kan
actually I'm not sure like our cousin yang always uh who are staying there kan who are staying there syakilah iman do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini lah dia orang ada kerja kan atau rumah kat sini kan
the malaysia people ah the ah all our saudara kat sana
oh cik rozi lama tak call eh
alhamdulilah dah makan dah I think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu lah we just ate the
kuah apa kari ah kuah kari and I just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu lah
ah that one the smell nanti apa
iya lah bau dia kan nanti tu kan nanti iya lah tutup tingkap
but I know ah I know how to cook macam like simple simple ah like usually I cook thai food ah sweet and sour fish
and kai lan ikan masin
baby kai lan ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni ah ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni ah barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde ah just find a replacement ah macam
that time takde ikan apa eh ikan tenggiri ke apa eh
so uh I replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu ah nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin ah macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
simple lah dia punya masak it's not that hard ah just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ah boneless and dia macam I think it's dried ah dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried lah dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube ah cube then with that cube just ah letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu kan
dah lembut ah baru tu lah pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby kai lan
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan I think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome ah kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung ah tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat ah sweet and sour sauce
tapi tu lah I think this is like the starting point ah cuma macam nak I think I took me awhile ah like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni lah
ya true ah barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me kan senang ah I think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house kan the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house kan
iya lah iya lah of course
ah iya lah
pause jap eh pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu kan kerja timing dia kan
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day kan except malam ah kan
dah berumur ya
mmhmm betul
ada lah dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada lah sometimes I think
that time I saw like macam halal punya daging kan
ya really ni lah dia punya which section eh the section yang ada frozen food
actually I saw this youtube video ah very interesting dia macam punya shopping
tapi I don't think singapore ada ah dia macam like I think in america ke apa ah which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop kan there'll be someone who welcome you pastu ah you using the lah I think it's a like the device ah you need to buy the device device
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty lah dia punya ni ah
tapi it's very hard ah like I mean the software wise like
iya lah iya lah
of course ah dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing four punya punya tu kan console
but I think can be solved ah like technology wise macam they keep changing kan most like it's probably ah I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change ah macam in terms of like the new normal
like dulu takde kan I think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer ah work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days ah
kat rumah lah you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
ah ya lah as long as you do something lah usually the manager will ni lah the
you need to be apa
ah ya lah my company former company use zoom for ni lah
macam container ah nak letak something container like small one ah ya but I think ah
tak tahu ah hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
ya they they limit ni lah the number of ah customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa ah
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person kan they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space ah they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time lah kalau weekend kan in tampines kan
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control eh ya ya
ya betul
oh iya lah iya lah
ya I think it's a bit tu lah a bit
it's a bit scary ah kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa kan
like actually you say you heard places yang some
apa dia orang kena ni kan kena warning kan because of this thing kan
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya lah you see like in at apa shopping mall like it's those crowded kan nowadays macam susah nak control ah
ya I think they will just monitor lah this apa maybe there's someone
watching the ke apa kan they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
check out lah don't check out lah ya it's very difficult to ni
about I think regarding the the battery lah dia cepat habis ah
like the the nearby devices kan siapa yang
um google and apple kan to ni with the android dengan phone
or you still stick with ni
I think this is still depends cause google home kan they detect ni kan the surrounding kan
as long as jauh ah microphone dengan I mean dia punya google home kan ada microphone kan
I'm not too sure ah like like what will be the reply like ah macam default like
ya maybe ah maybe ya ya the default punya default
oh iya lah iya lah ada offline data lah persistent storage ah
maybe you can try like alexa ke
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation kan so at certain points at certain ah zone for example I think punggol ke sengkang eh
like punggol kan there's there's a lot of flat kan so I think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices ah macam ah smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart lah basically so bila macam masuk bilik
for example smart light you enter a room kan nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase ah
as we walk into macam tu example jer lah
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
I think they have ah macam
ya macam ada sensor kan
ah iya lah iya lah
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country kan dia kat india eh
ya there's some country use that ah macam pedal ke apa
I think in singapore ada some building kan dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar jer
okay then nak bual pasal apa
apa what's the last one
for the rest oh my god it's so lame you nak makan apa
and dia kata apa he wanted to eat ya I told him if we get like one thing
then he was like ya nasi ayam
entah lah
speaking of makanan
so it's like a shape of a sotong
you tengok you tengok you just look at it first you want turn turn on the lights or no
kejap eh
eh it's delicious sedap
but is the shape of sotong
sedap kan so that is mala this is the most spiciest one
so the tak pedas sangat like
ada rasa macam dia then then dia tak macam meresap or like or like lama-lama macam tu
sedap kan sedap kan
so um I google and then youtube this thing cuba tengok dia orang makan macam mana um basically they open like four five packets
dekat dalam mangkuk and then apa
sedap kan
they will accept this conversation at us kunyah-kunyah makan-makan
but you see the shape of the sotong is actually it looks legit macam sotong
oh my bad jangan kena baju
it will really stain tadi tadi you drop on my kasut
then don't bother makan dia punya oil
macam apa what's that word eh macam
randomly ah my friend dia cakap mm
I don't know how he came up with this stupid scenario dia cakap kalau macam uh what if you
scenario but dia kata
something like macam if this guy bump into you
the black american card uh not american card pula apa the black
meaning like unlimited spending dekat dalam itu ada macam a billion dollars he say you can do whatever you want with it lah
he let you spend use the card for one hour what would you do with the duit
bear in mind satu jam jer

when I tengah tidur malam-malam nanti I will burp then like it will get stuck in my throat
I tutup lampu I macam panas siol see told you you're thirsty already right

it's like two totally different things and then I got a before that I got uh no when I was at when I had my diploma I had my apa

dia punya perangai macam eh he he's like putting a front or a defense kind of thing
everyone macam sus

mm no itu betul-betul menjaga seh
mister soput itu nak kena sebat
so it's like wah ini kalau ada uh ya can always teman what like someone to talk to
instead of seorang seorang
ya exactly then it's going to be perap in this whole room
considerable amount of space to joget-joget
move around lah at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like bersepahkan
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything semua sekarang tengah mahal I don't know ah like
I have no idea okay lah probably yes I have an idea what is is mahal now because
panasnya ya allah
then that that that's the thing price should be kurang apa should be lesser what
and nak itu pasang apa
and then have to pasang another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
the outside of the house was like rimas
then after that bersepah lagi then rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows ah tingkap macam best
kan mahal
you fikir masak-masak dulu like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like fikir masak-masak dulu like if you move in
no I think I think she like macam because her life
got so susah kan so she want like
she tak nak tengok dia punya husband and new wife hidup senang
ya so I think that's what she wanted lah so that the husband hidup susah juga macam tak fair kalau
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her tapi cause that's what she's not getting from the husband what
who the siapa
dia berapa episode ah sixteen eh
but other than that I think macam the korean punya broadcasting stations all like their um
ah no sebab kan
so I hardly ever like really habis kan any drama
I actually for my migraine lah cause my ubat migraine finish already
skin condition if it's like macam he can lah
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then dia cakap can ah but
he will prescribe topical or oral punya ubat like they don't do aesthetic services ah
then I say okay I understand then lepas tu dia cakap but if you want I can try to give you like
macam the first three months I give you this ubat
because he said is not ah because I I I did ask him is my macam I feel like my face is so macam rabak ah then dia cakap
oh err it's not like macam really a severe case so I can still macam prescribe prescribe
ubat for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the kecil-kecil punya biji
ya lah like macam there's no head on top right
like I don't macam I don't see myself spending
but yours is not like macam yours is just macam white heads kind of
ah you just get from Cosrx kat Watsons ada
maybe that's because like macam depends on the product lah
haven't yet macam usually my cystic acne right other than this lah
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone gitu jer
like macam after you get you've after you give birth like macam
and then apa bekam kan muka ada mini cups LOL what the heck
even even in even on weekends right macam rare gila
I think aini macam semua turun-menurun because ayah dulu pun ada pe macam gini
you see ayah face lah or all the macam wak mak long also have like
like the bekas-bekas
I regret one thing I regret right macam in my life
my poly first year seventeen when I gatal-gatal you know bila

you use the macam the high the heavy duty punya Kat Von D dulu then
no lah I'm just saying then I didn't know what macam I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation what so I just use that every time so macam I think that
but it's so it's not accessible nak beli
ya so kirakan macam
kalau pakai makeup lebih
muka muka lagi rabak even though like macam I do the proper cleansing ah
ya because like macam I don't put anything on my face what and I do macam regular
punya skincare
pakai plaster
I know I mean it's the wrong timing for my pimple sticker to habis but don't know ah see how lah later
ya kebaya
boots no I never buy I never buy I only buy like strappies and the tu
apa senang lah kalau nak pergi kerja
two bikes what then I thought like macam he thought when I get my license then I just
use that lah rather than to leave that bike all the time kat car park jer tak buat apa-apa
the high maintenance mean kalau buat delivery is very macam will cepat rosak and cepat
masalah so naz will spend more if he use that bike to do delivery
bapa dia orang kecil bapa dia orang that time datang sembang dengan ayah I thought bapa dia gini ayah ayah like lagi tinggi jer

macam dekat part of the story was like the guy that dia suka or like macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta kan
it's actually it was was one of the reason why dia buta
ya ah because of like when he got when she got into an accident the lelaki tu macam buat benda yang like
tak tak supposed to buat lah because you know you know
ah then after that like it lead her to macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu
then yang paling sedih part is actually like bila
err perempuan tu kena undergo surgery kan pasal boleh actually boleh like rawat lah like boleh get better so that guy pasal that guy macam very poor tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam you know
kerja cara wrestling semua so kerja untuk like because they macam ah couple what
so like that guy macam ah dia
kerja sampai dapat duit untuk undergo for that girl to undergo surgery ah
then after and then after that bila like uh
ya so because of that rant dia bagi like duit to undergo surgery then when the surgery tu was successful
dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu lah because he doesn't want to like
and after that yang part sedih was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
dia macam contact later like contemplating whether he should jumpa perempuan tu balik or like
tinggalkan so bila part like
bila part dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena stabbed
from like this like bad people because dia dulu kerja memang jahat
then after that dia kena coma for two years ah
lelaki tu kena coma for two years and after that he was in like this like care hospital macam orang jaga then that girl was one of the volunteer
you know the thing is like bila coma so he cannot talk what
ah that's japanese punya movie lah but then bila like sekarang hospital tu then the guy was like the the guy saw the girl but he cannot say anything then he was crying so bad then perempuan tu macam
apa ni like
then like he alleged actually before that he also macam buat sculpture
ceramic so he before that macam when dia buta he she felt the lelaki muka ah
so and then after that uh I think macam there was one this music box yang reminded of both of them
one of the pekerja kata dengan perempuan tu yang there's this guy who came in the
crying while listening to music box terus dia tahu ah that was like the last part terus dia tahu yang
apa it was the guy that
ya but then the only reason why she wanted to undergo the surgery was because the guy kata um you don't want to see like our home together our future together our child together then the part damn sad ah sedih gila and after that ya me and abang was like tengah teared out already then the whole cinema tengah nangis gila kelakar gila seh
no I mean like if I explain all obviously like it doesn't really make sense lah but then if you tengok the trailer is already so sad ya that's like the the movie yang like made me cry so bad
in a cinema like never in my life I cry so bad but I cried so bad there then even my abang was like are you crazy
kat netflix kan
how many seasons ada though
eh banyak
wah it's like macam the
dia pada like when he was like a'ah
dia semua ingat dia orang macam like weird
who are this semua nak
kahwin semua and like a lot of people look down on him lah
oh ah betul betul
serious ah ah so like betul betul just like awkward lah
ah tak boleh just
just like kahwin terus lah dia dia straight
but like to me like nowadays I don't I'm not that interested in those like mat salleh
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and kakak and abang also like watch everyday like at the
eh but then like thankfully like ibu and bapa is like
that time I came back home then lepas tu ah ibu was like um

I I beli like I bought there was like
a few only then I'm like I mean okay lah it's not that expensive so ni lah I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits dekat
dekat somerset
it's like bingsoo then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe dekat dengan

start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very mahal like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
a'ah then kau kalau also need to promote then what if like orang don't want to come so
tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap then that was the problem fit in the cafe
ah they just go there to take picture ambil gambar aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two punya ni like

in the future I don't know what I want to be I don't know what I want to like what I'm interested in and all so macam like err kadangkala also macam keliru like I know what to do so macam I guess I want to find like something that
because I feel like I I like to try like a lot of things so macam

cuma just
kenangan kenangan yang lalu ee I don't know I cringe
true especially this year raya like
uh kita tak dapat pergi jalan raya kan then kita tak dapat jumpa most of them so we really haven't seen them like one year plus gitu
oh I thought worst I was like oh my god no hal
can't ejek seh
to eat it because I really like the biscuit and between like me and my datuk like um
he always like uh cakap like
the biskut is biskut hospital lah dia tanya oh adik nak ke tak biskut hospital ini then I'm like yes please please nak like it's so good like macam like um
I will makan it with Milo or like or like minum teh gitu then I will eat the biskut together
that biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah] with my datuk so I used the biskut as the background of the painting then uh for the forefront of the painting like I put uh my sofa all like from the living room
like tribute gitu
so like I just joined it so I'm trying to start drawing again like I really rindu art lah
it's true it's like I I know a lot of people yang macam
they ada then uh like they
letak like all their energy into the
then their is like wrecked ah but then they are like very bagus in their
word of the day penat
it's very macam
asal kerja merepek seh
tapi sekarang susah lah because uh COVID ya then banyak orang
that masuk that programme jadi to have something to fall back on
legit lah compared to like having tak ada kerja langsung kan
imagine those lagi like
orang is not oh
I don't know macam cool
rasa seh tapi this is like
oh oh I know so you are saving the earth by not eating sayur because you love the earth then the earth need more sayur
my nenek love kambing man
she gonna give any excuse just to eat kambing
she can makan kambing for like
I don't know I think she can eat kambing for like
the whole month straight or something really seh we really have to macam kita kena macam hold dia back untuk
like from eating kambing it's just that bad but she got like high blood pressure all which is like bad ah
you just triggered my like primary school memories like I uh like my my last time school also they they tanam pokok Ribena then they they kasi like me macam
pegang the Ribena punya fruit
it was quite cool like but I don't know how the dia orang buat the fruit to the air gitu
macam like dia orang just
um dia punya buah dia like
like it's not even buah it's dia macam bunga gitu
tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu eh
oh but tapi dia buat apa competition
oh dah itu jer
tapi cute seh
oh sedihnya
satu minggu jer
but I like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like macam
singapore cuba try
jadi macam more environment friendly
I don't know dia orang buat like macam ada certain
just rich like dia orang rasa like that sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu so dia orang macam oh just bayar it gitu
so like they will still bayar it like that ten cent like I think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something I know fifty cents kan confirm orang macam lagi terasa macam like oh my god that is like duit like I should really bawa my own plastic bag or like bag in general
you know like very like feminine punya bags
apa seh I thought I want to like
kumpul duit from uh
family member ah like kita ramai ramai kumpul duit then like beli something
tapi right some of them already uh like dah beli like dah beli the present
ya then they buy like bag wallet gitu which is something that
I want to buy ah like I don't mind macam we kumpul duit then we buy like macam expensive like Coach or what you know like something a bit more pricey like more quality kan then how ah or maybe I should ask them ah but I haven't like ask them you know
dia orang kena ada bunyi gold kan like
mak cik tak trend ah
she just like gitu jer like it's usually like clothes like very cliche ah like clothes bag like wallet
actually boleh juga ah
boleh ah go jer
I think you know I think I can like kumpul then like buy
uh gelang tangan
because itu hari kan me and my sister we went to Tiffany & Co dekat jurong east
then actually kan dia punya harga pon like tak mahal mana ah like it's still like quite okay I can like kumpul duit ah or maybe like can be just like my immediate family kumpul duit then we just like buy gelang or something I think jewelry is like a good idea
ya boleh juga [ah]
so macam mana this considered as the start ah
oh just now just now tadi meet up dengan ni dengan rizal
dengan shahrizal
dia punya dia mum passed away and
his mum passed away is about pasal cancer ah
then ah there was err few years ago lah abang tak ingat bila ah
so ya so sekarang dia kerja dia kerja ni dia kerja jual emas
so dia ada dia ada kedai lah dekat mana dekat jurong east station kind
dia kerja CISCO
and then now dia macam work like this lah dia dengan wife dia
so dengan wife it's like doing like those like last time the event event the wife will sell those like macam those cakes
like Ferrero Rocher kind you know so he would do event lah tadi dia cakap
so dia cakap dia just tolong bini dia lah ya lah kan tolong bini dia
dia cakap doing but now masks currently is just masks lah plus events ah
probably ya because dia cakap dia ada ada dekat storage space dia ada apa err where all day he keep all the fridge there fridge
all those the cake fridge got for last time they rent so now dia dah beli secondhand lah
like you know dia check out that time
oh you know ni err beach road is closed do you know that the hawker is closed apparently
the tulang place nearby lah there's another tulang place lah
just go there because I was alamak I was so like not so clever move lah cause I was wearing white right then I eat tulang alamak it was like alamak disaster
ya so the the tulang experience wasn't so enjoyable because you know
dia ada ni lah dia ada apa ada macam titik sikit lah
not bukan macam like yang splash it was
err tulang dropped then there was a splash and I thought it was gone but okay lah but everybody is stained lah just now everybody have err something to remember ya ya
so is very evident lah that everybody ate tulang right so
shah shah then after that rizal lah rizal rizal also dia punya
ya nama dia shahrizal kita panggil dia shah
and rizal also lah rizal dia punya daughter next year P one what
daughter dia
ya ya ya tu err tu lain itu rizal
and then dia punya son dia punya son
is err in learning age apa
ya son dia nama harris
dia punya daughter is I think
ya punggol so dia cakap his house ke apa lah gitu
apparently dia cakap dia nak kena jumpa hari ni
because err something like err dia punya daughter is taking up chinese so
he jumpa then after that dah boleh ni lah I think got in err school something like that
so besok kita nak buat apa eh
ya apparently I thought like not non-halal then I see then I was err passing by there with err kak zarina today then
kak dina cakap eh ni dia cakap eh tengok dia makan dia macam like because dia tak eat all those stuff lah like korean korean ni aku tak tahu uh kalau macam ni ni dia cakap lah mana boleh makan ni tak halal eh tak eh halal ah
that's why dia pun cook pun like mother mother punya cook
ikan sepat go ikan sepat ah apa
eh dia ada three daughters
pun dah adult pe
anak dia already adult like I think
the youngest one also is like what twenty one this this sunday eh this weekend besok ah dia punya birthday
panggil family come eat she cook
balik time ah balik fetch her tuition
anyways uh ya you were saying apa tadi afikah pasal
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got dia ada macam beberapa sample gitu
because in her team kan ada macam leader tau
so leader leader nak kena macam like
err macam leader macam uh if got macam the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier lah
so if this is a macam leader punya role lah
so tapi macam this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge ah you team leader
so they cakap lah got one one time tu
eh dia cakap dia she was in the toilet sekali ada this leader
ah and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking ah talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave ah like macam like you know
so diorang cakap then the other lady was saying like err eh then you leave then how ah
cause is like err say I also new say dia cakap like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is uh this indian lady lah older than her like master degree and all
but tapi dia macam I think the quiet type lah you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
oh okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague pun macam like eh
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so tak maybe ya I don't know maybe tak
tak stand out properly I think ya
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay apa like you know at least you know the next job
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good what kita nak orang orang ya that's why
so what was the painting yang painting tu dekat mana
ya so so what's what's what's going on dekat apa gillman baracks is that ah is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right
eh apa tadi
tiba-tiba ah
the first his car tu apa
more than she did that then what's that just now she called me then dia cakap dia nak apa go vivian house tomorrow
ada jer
mangsa dia kan
dah habis eh
okay so nanti next next friday dah decided where to eat
tapi I think dia macam macam weird leh
cause senang lah you are you're opening a restaurant and you are using my name eh
you know eh kau aku one thing then you use my name
oh she came ah tadi
okay habis so sekarang dia tak laptop ke macam mana
eh ya you say you want to have like nak advertise what paid by
so hari ni siapa buat all these err like math questions
there's time for solat there's time to bath there's time to eat
yang first paragraph tu nak kena bagus lah
that's why I was eh ya ada eh accountant
but last time was like very far because apa eh dia macam english camp gitu ah
go this camp ah and like dia ajar dia ada macam
err I think ada video let him talk then he see himself
I think last time eh ada tau macam Mendaki Mendaki macam apa
macam like err after kind and then like
that kind got cedar girls tapi ada ah macam all that ada
macam really smart smart student one ah ah ya lah for sure
tapi ada juga ya some some of them is nice ah nice like talk normally some of them also like a bit weird you know
like macam
then ah think we were int the room then I don't know what's wrong with that guy makan pun nak tidur
then the aircon have to be like super blast one ah then quite sejuk
some Mendaki camp right so we had like solat all that lah
you know they need to pay tahu tak I think tak payah
I don't think I think I go there by self I go there myself I come back pun myself
that one ya uh tapi he buy like those like
nak buat apa sia ni buat apa
tak ingat ah siapa
so tu dia orang lah
ni apa ni ni kira apa ni Facebook ah
ya lah dengar baik dengar they they say that now
err apa eh get the sebab like
like your parents punya house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
so tanya ah your mum macam mana
eh tapi you not there what you should be there I think you should be around ah like to hear like you know that time you were around right mencari sales whatever whatever right
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are dah tukar ke belum
kalau dia dah tukar what is changed you know
ya ya then from there then she cuma
mm so I think what you are concerned that one dah macam like stage three stage four lah to sell like how to like
now is number one kita nak tahu whether boleh
ya boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita belief that can jual also is is it really makes sense to jual
then if jual already then after that then
and like decide on what to do kalau it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
semalam ada dengar yang pasal news yang I think there is another three families yang dia cakap
yang geylang lorong something ya ya ya ya
macam macam weird ah I don't know whether it's an old
family ke apa ke kan
lah this one I just knew like here dengar dekat radio jer
so tinggal lagi berapa minit you cakap tadi berapa minit
besok confirm aku nak kena like
oh dia apa cakap-cakap oo buat dia cakap apa err
kita talk ah I see
si liza left already then talk take another friend
tak ada lah not confidential just talk about family lah family macam gitu
tapi dah cakap like
tak tahu asal lah dia cakap dia oh
sha sha rambut dah putih like I think she he like she got a lot of white hair so is like like what
jom kita bercatch up
sekolah kau macam mana ah
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
tapi if I were to
like menyerah my freedom cause kan being a being a photographer is like a freelancer job
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah ah satu kali aku um aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak ah
okay ah kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay ah not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you leh
oof aku pun nak pergi korea sia
eh hari tu aku baru tengok movie tau keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir ah if right you found a time capsule ah from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule ah
ah ah eh kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if manja tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do ah
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga ah kalau nak jadi free
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy mendaki tu semua kan
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok ah nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university ke susah juga ah
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni ah kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university ah under medicine gitu tapi susah juga ah pasal very competitive punya situation so if I were to join a local university ah under medicine it will be so competitive with all the kids lor
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer ah tapi macam
impian photographer jer macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer kan so dia punya
hmm so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa ah tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
kau pula kau punya course apa ah
tak ah aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
aku tengah cari kerja ah sekarang tapi pasal
times are tough ah so I know for government pun they macam
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
so a bit lah I don't think so I can tahan lor
eh berbual pasal COVID COVID ni semua kan eh aku dengar that time kau kena
satu kat malaysia
the one in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow ah
um that's why ah if like you want to study overseas as a melayu I think kan australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where ah the place has accommodates to what you are lah like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat itaewon situ ah ah cause I heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah kan confirm kau tengok banyak Netflix kan confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat Netflix
tak aku tengok movie eh
I a bit scaredy cat ah to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer I don't know kalau kau tahu ah tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam ah detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre ah ah so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like um then people started believing it ah cause they are like mere humans kan so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also ah he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show ah but it's super overrated now
no bukan part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different um two different parts ah so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of COVID right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes mah so in september then they resuming back lor cause the COVID
maybe can rent bike because I don't know if kat situ macam ada tempat rental bike kan macam east coast park kan ada tapi I dengar east coast park pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ
ah dia macam dia macam mana nak cakap ah dia macam mysterious kau tahu tak dia mysterious abeh macam kau ajak kan dia macam tak comfortable gitu dengan lelaki eh dengan perempuan so kat dalam school context okay ah but outside school context aku tak tahu ah tapi aku punya cikgu yang lagi satu kau tahu yang yang teacher tu aku nak jumpa tapi aku macam paiseh aku tak tahu nak ajak dia keluar ke tak
tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa
aku jumpa kau kat situ pe hari tu
aku tak ada sebab aku tengok jer aku tak ada sebab serious aku suka turun bawa pasal aku punya kan abeh aku sorang aku rasa abeh aku macam catch up ah dengan cikgu cikgu lain semua sekejap tapi other than that not much ah aku tak dapat aku ada number dorang ah tapi macam aku tak tahu kalau dorang save aku punya nombor ke tak ataupun dorang okay ke tak keluar dengan ex student tak tahu ah kau pernah nak ajak kau punya cikgu arts tak keluar
um a'ah lah dorang sekolah tapi lain lain tapi ada satu yang sama sama sekolah dengan aku um tapi dia different course ah dia masuk dulu baru dia year one sekarang aku kan year two sekarang so tu jer lah yang sama yang lain semua A-level ah
oh yang A-level punya dah quite some time ah dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa kan sekarang dengan A-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat tampines kan jauh kan
cause kan one of my friends yang A-level dia dia sekolah dekat jer ah not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit lor but cause we not that far right so not too bad ah cause our group of friends then got three of us so
I actually sometimes I want to see some teachers outside of school lah so like if I see them at least I can I got chance mah to say eh how you doing but because I never see them outside ah a bit sian lor then lor cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah ah gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi ah apa rumah cikgu cikgu kan tak boleh pasal COVID kan so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita kan lelaki
zoom raya ah it was like um I got two session ah one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause hor but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call I three three like three families ah like mine included lor but then my dad side ah eight siblings eh difficult leh then they all very they cannot hear one another
dress up tak dress up ah pakai dress jer pastu dulu punya baju raya ah aku tahu lepas baju raya dengan buat rambut sikit sekejap jer lepas tu
a'ah bodoh aku makan semua kau tahu tak aku makan semua kuih raya aku yang aku buat aku habiskan tak ada orang nak aku makan aku gemuk during zaman raya tu
my favourite kuih raya will be no doubt kan my grandmother's pineapple tart kau tahu tak aku punya nenek punya pineapple tart special punya
abeh kau punya favourite kuih raya
you talking about the cornflakes ah the honey cornflakes ah I go to everybody's house I sebat you know I makan all of their honey cornflake until I ask them to top up
tu ah like personal experience right then like wah every confirm hor you open your cabinet finish already still confirm got few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth right
yes ma'am then you know hari raya haji also this year at least got the the the curcuit breaker the the the I don't know ah what they call it ah the rule the ruling I think
not too bad ah can visit this year for hari raya haji like like five people per family eh five five visitors per household so you eh hari raya haji you got got visit your aunty your cousin I don't know
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
I cannot tahan ah I think ah I had to celebrate my birthday during circuit breaker like my birthday was right after the circuit breaker um announcement ah so a bit sad ah then like you know uh cannot have the big celebration like last time so I celebrate with my family lor but then I celebrate with my family also cannot do much cannot eat outside mah during that period of time so all order in lor then like a bit special kind of situation lah cause first time mah celebrate at home nobody else so okay ah not too bad hor how about you what is the most difficult part bila kau during circuit breaker
ah I drink bubble tea but like cause I a bit lactose intolerant so I can drink maybe like the small one if not like my stomach a bit upset so aku punya favourite bubble tea is called HEYTEA dia cuma ada kat orchard dengan jurong so tak banyak sangat ah aku quite picky on aku punya bubble tea KOI Gong Cha tu semua okay ah tapi aku lebih suka HEYTEA it's more settling to my stomach kirakan so if I buy bubble tea I will buy kat orchard ah kat situ kalau dekat dekat dengan rumah aku Gong Cha ah tapi tu bila kakak aku belanja tapi aku sekarang dah tak suka bubble tea kau pernah try mister coconut
yang colour pink yang mana satu
oh cause I go with my friend ah then my friend helped to pilih then you know she like a bit like a bubble tea expert ah she keep all the bubble tea chart all in singapore but then like um cause I wasn't that much of a bubble tea fan before so macam aku tak tahu apa aku nak beli abeh dia tolong aku dia tolong aku um pilihkan apa bubble tea like I think I tried the kalau aku tak salah aku tried the not the pink pearl ah I tried the tapioca pearl kot oh tak aku try yang black sesame pearl tu macam tak sedap sangat
aku rasa eh HEYTEA pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli ah aku selalu beli brown sugar so HEYTEA is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat CHICHA San Chen kau pernah try CHICHA San Chen tak
oh tu dia punya pearl very chewy very um sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu ah basically dorang letak susu jer so but then I like their pearl ah not bad not bad sama dengan HEYTEA tapi kan paling mahal kan is uh not too sure eh hmm maybe
maybe maybe KOI aku dah lama tak tak try KOI
aku tak suka pearl dia ah to be honest like I tried the pearl ah it's a bit I mean I cannot I cannot expect lor cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so uh I just anyhow ah but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea lor I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended ah ice blended or something like that ah small like that lor
shiok bro shiok I tell you my favourite drink ah is horlick cause of that I I I cannot stop drinking horlicks ah I tell you is like wah out of the place eh my favourite drink now so like wah thinking about my school food ah oof now ah got halal mala also in one of the food court so not bad ah then their mala also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken ah suddenly come out ah after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces eh then we don't know where it go
then in another of our food court got like this one like food ah I think I think this other poly also have is like um Indomie wah Indomie goreng that one the best bro that one like my go to that one ah with horlicks oof me and my friend every day right every day buy that meal then you leh what's your favourite food in school
wah but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold leh like I swear I don't wear jacket right I I I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch ah somehow ah the aircon a bit leh sekali become hot but maybe because of window open ah then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
sometimes ya ah cause like we want the space to study right after school ah cause we need the school wi-fi then lor all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late ah then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend lor then they take up the space in um in the library eh then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already what they we cannot tell them uh excuse me we need the table mah so just have to tahan lor like wah leh then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor ah sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die ah ah this kids ah
but I say ah she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do mah so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient ah inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat kan semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada ah tu memang ah tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam ah how to say ah modified ah I guess
hmm oh I like soup ah so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat ah cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning ah she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks ah I don't know if you got try before kuih keria wah that one I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy ah cause that's the least I can do mah then Sheng Siong also a bit a bit pity on her ah to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her lor
dekat tu dekat ah jauh pun jauh cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood mah so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk ah don't want waste money don't want waste money buy ah apa sometimes take bus ah if I lazy want go home like that ah I take bus but other than that I walk ah walk faster
actually tak I go seorang
I got here like thirty minutes lah cause you know ah the train ah super late ah I really hate it you know the aunty mak cik all very irritating
tak lah kau gila punya jauh aku kalau boleh nak naik Grab but I didn't take Grab either no lah I very very everything I just take train or Grab but that time Grab is expensive ah so cannot lah okay I no more money already
eh you text me just now you say kau cakap kau ada mimpi eh
walao eh sakit sia
oh got saga just sambung ah walao eh then the then the second dream whose inside the dream
then the baby like what how she look like is she naughty dia baik ke dia macam
ya lor so macam like got the happy ending lah
ya but so many signs eh already like before sebelum ni pun macam like kau dah ada mimpi-mimpi right like all this type of dreams
so okay my intention is that ah aku nak cakap dengan engkau dulu the dream then after that both of us can like um
but like ten years ago how how umur kau berapa ten years ago
eighteen siapa kau dengan siapa ah masih dengan azee
so enam belas tahun kau tahu lah kan sec four eh ah sec four pun nak cakap apa sia dengan diri aku
dah happening ah actually dok aku sec four pasal aku dah jumpa julie semua apa
aku rasa macam aku wild cause uh I met him towards the end of my sixteen so means aku dah habis A-levels ah
so then ah hakim and I we started meeting and then he taught me how to longboard then we went to gigs but it's like going out with him is very decent like you know macam not say abang lah but he's
longboard I even worked with him at his Sakura part time until the following year uh seventeen years old I I masuk
uh and I hope that you're still friends with hakim which I still am alhamdulillah
our english always berterabur sis
tapi memang irritating ah kan
umur dia berapa macam oh
is she like really obvious that she didn't see you or dia just buat buat tak nampak
ah seh so no I'm like okay I like definitely if you ask me now I don't think there's anything that can make me dislike a person but if I try to backward backward like zaman I more impulsive and reckless
macam kita cakap macam condescending like like kita ni macam bodoh like that then ya lah then macam okay oh oh okay this one is the pettiest reason
because he tegur ah so it make me not like him so it's a petty reason lah
ya lah ya lah it's like okay but then again because the way they tegur ah it's like really kurang ajar also
but there is ways for you to like kejutkan orang you know this engineer ah will really scream at your face yell at your face one leh like like no cara tak ada cara aku aku macam nak sepak muka dia but then
masa kat kerja right tak boleh buat apa-apa so okay lah just terima seadanya jer lah
oh ya I think kau pernah bilang dengan aku ini
she's so weird because pasal kau dengan dia macam tak ada kena mengena gitu
like and then like my friend happens to be that conversation so she she told me then di belakang aku padahalnya macam
she's like kau tahu yang ni tak suka kau then aku macam apasal
she then like I was really shocked lah cause aku really like pandang dia macam sister ah but then like
and then I'm like when I heard that I was like kesian or what like you think your tits are the selling point ah bro
ya and it's like very macam
rabak ah like eh aku oval tak tahu merah ke tak sial bising sial aku oval ha walao eh
then I ask lah who is this girl then he told me then I know that girl what she's my ex-classmate then I then I then aku naive ah habis aku cakap dengan dia ah like
like you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know lah she's my classmate dia dulu like always
stupid sia you just so stupid like you're so stupid like perangai jantan kebrek punya macam like oh you are les let me turn you straight like you don't try to be some hero and in fact she's the one who manipulated you
so ya lah but I never confronted after her her after that but if I everytime I saw her at school I will just like jeling her so hard and like actually uh like I'm not the type to
hate on girls or are like macam be enemies with them but wow what she did was something so nasty and like even if she never did it to me right let's say she did the whole thing to another person I would still feel so turned off
I know lah like okay your self esteem probably like jatuh because you know all the guys like went to me like I don't blame you for that but for you to take vengeance that way is so dirty and nasty sia
ya babe kau tak payah cakap babe ex aku dia nombor satu babe dia kalau buat benda dia fikir pakai konek jer dulu sebelum apa-apa babe
bodoh sia
I think it's just more to me it comes off to me like wah aku tak tahu ada manusia macam gini macam that can do that to someone else not that I was so hurt by it but I'm just like so
apa babe
ya that's so awesome nanti kalau kau pergi travel settle sia
oh ya and like baca quran and also kau faham
I'm not surprised that you want that because aku macam pernah nampak kau like one like being handy like remember that that that thing jatuh kat toilet
like ah but it's not because I will learn cooking eventually but it will be like beginner level so if I could take one skill that's immediate like chef level mak aku punya level I will take cooking
aku tahu berenang ah but I pun tak pernah masuk dalam ah berenang aku tahu pasal kat secondary school kita belajar
eh float dah okay sia some people don't even know how to float which I teach them also ah sometimes
but ya I would learn how to sea dive actually it's a very ah actually cooking and sea diving I feel is very doable lah can so ya but if I could choose it right now aku terus tahu it's sea diving ah
kau bayar setakat berapa hundred dollars then kau dapat can do sea diving cuma kat singapore nothing to sea dive ah so you have to overseas ah
so third skill if I could pick up okay ah kalau nak cakap nyanyi nyanyi is more of like a natural born lah so tak boleh ah kan
can ke oh kena vocal coaching
ya ah like okay some people macam like born with it like dah bagus but ya there's many cases dia orang macam vocal coaching right
right is the vocal coach yang kau tengok kat YouTube tristan is it
ah I always watch tristan correct and then his recent videos james charles nyanyi dia sedap sia ya it's nice
rabak sial babe
suddenly aku suddenly aku punya spike up banyak apasal
kau can think out of the box kau boleh ambil orang err orang korea orang jepun orang malaysia orang indonesia it's up to kau lor
so you wake up you look at the cermin and then you'll be like oh be that man be like ya sia then eyebrows I've dark eyebrows
but you know kau tahu ah dia kena bahan rabak kan kau tak tahu eh rabak
dia actually from season tak dia tak kena bahang umbrella academy umbrella academy does a great job ya kat luar because
kau faham tak he's young like no lah macam like booboos like err macam on Instagram live macam macam macam acting weird acting macam socially awkward
but I guess the ones who's making fun of him are also about that age ah macam thirteen sia so ya but then it's a lot of them so they really bahang kan him lah ya
but you know goodness kau tu belum lagi nampak
ada satu video dia nyanyi kat Instagram live memang kelakar ah dia macam nyanyi yang yang love yang love love tu but that is not so rabak also
correct cause we're like dude oh wait kita lagi rabak daripada dia kan okay we couldn't even act back then
rabak ah uh correct but then I think after season two ah umbrella academy kan
macam this season dia orang lagi banyak scenes kan and like boleh cakap he bawa the whole show on his back
so it's like even though like the bahang still exist but uh I think a lot of people are giving him acknowledgement and credit that he deserve ah for season two
padahal dia orang tunjuk pun macam the videos of him being socially awkward with his fans online pun macam pada aku like normal seh like it's just like macam
dia macam okay he has a sort of personality lah which is a bit quirky but if we see it as quirky then you will understand why his awkward not as
it can be anything from audio err to like macam you doing cartoon and then he will showcase it and bring it forward to the world you know
like ya that's why uh recently if you saw dia macam post something like hey someone in malaysia can you guys um
err say a a poem a puisi in malay err so that aku like so that dia boleh
wife dia is a like a like a brilliant also like she's some ah president for like an kind of company so
personal life cause I was a fan I was a very huge fan of johnny depp when I was in my teenage years all so aku
okay dia tak resist to adopt like so many kids from different parts of the world
and it takes two hands to clap also and also like I think the relationship between brad pitt and angelina tu pun macam dysfunctioning at that point of time like because brad pitt did come up of thing to be saying that
jennifer still wanted to have fun macam you know they were they were high they were taking weed
and then like when I see her older videos when she was younger right when she was like gila gila
macam you go out you go out of the house and then like so many girls
you can speak korean because that's the body's ability but then nanti ada orang melayu macam ah
aku faham sia dia cakap habis apa macam tapi how you learn that sia
ah ya ya tak payah pergi kerja so there's no nothing like you there's no transaction to get something or whatever so basically right maybe you can imagine the world in a in a more messed up way
like macam dah macam end of times ah tak ada kerja langsung ah macam so macam purge ke apa macam
it could be looked both ways it could be either super peaceful or either rabak it depends on the community I think
huh macam mana kau nak beli benda ya correct
jangan kau messed up dangut sudah sia you need this you
I feel like ya I feel like ya I feel like Netflix should do like a seh can just do a whole show based on this question alone like macam imagine kan
tak pernah ah singapore in general babe
dah banyak benda kita tak dia orang tak buat major it's so boring sia
but ya like the macam
imagine if they did something more non realistic like not family drama and like macam just you know
ah like that's why Netflix shows always make it what right because the umbrella academy is not going to happen in real life like ya apocalypse ini semua
okay definitely cannot be macam a one time hit thing pasal singapore satu
satu island dah jatuh babe ya dia kena macam sikit sikit sikit lah
but I think kalau macam there was like maybe a five episode show ah apocalypse in singapore kan
comedic like from there you know indian to the chinese to the malay then campur them together eh ya sia bro rabak already sia bro
same government and then like suddenly like everybody aunty uncle mak cik all united
oh he want to it could be anything lah ya like you said because global warming ah then you know factory they campak here campak there barang so like
so like using bandages lah obviously if you want to talk the islamic context we already know so we take that away this one is imagination is um ya I will just imagine that one person kena sakit
sakit then lepas tu um
ah dia sakit biasa habis dia dah mati tu kan doctor tu macam nak tengah nak tutup dia habis tu doctor tu sakit but from just sending tahu
then the doctor cough at the wife when he come back home then the wife sakit then the sakit she becomes the first zombie
then maybe we can place this selalu always the lah dapat all this kind of thing korea also already let's put this at malaysia very close home
so ya lah so then it starts from there then then you know malaysia people quite degil right they still want to surau they still want to solat at the masjid so they go and then orang masjid pula kena
gigit zombie and then very close to oh but then singapore is kiasu huh so from the first time we hear the one
person already kena then we already cut the borders so it's quite safe ya we already like
dian kuai dian</mandarin one like very cut that bridge ataupun ya correct
because tak boleh already sia kau tahu kalau macam zombie yang macam macam itu besar boleh lari punya habis sial dia lari sudah sampai dah so we have to like they have to
ya okay if they could if they could swim ah you know how singapura last time the history how we put the
you know the tajam-tajam that we couldn't let the sea the the ikan yang macam panjang ah correct
so we will go back to history and we'll do that so the cannot wah then like ya orang singapore will like train each other like macam
and we're like somehow tercampak from everyone else besides like err indonesia so ya but then this will
so bird flu semua we used to have bird flu lah swine flu lah banyak lah seh mad cow disease
ya macam case macam chronic gila macam kau once flu okay this person is going to die in two days
actually a lot of things sia anything if you do it repetitive for eight hours macam boleh merana sia
so imagine kalau kau brush your teeth it's a normal act tapi imagine you have to do it eight hours
gum kau dah dah dah dah dah sah dah sah dah kau dah over
ya so actually anything could be err ni kalau tapi exercise
cuma only maybe tengok ah it won't be a torture
pasal kau boleh tukar banyak channel kan kesian ah aku kat rumah
ya tak lah pasal kalau kau tengok different different cerita lain ah okay ah kalau kalau kau tengok the same show for eight hour then ya maybe ah
but then if like because kalau tengok ah cerita like err in general for eight hours it's not even like torture it's like it's what we do on like rest days like
ya unless your eating is like macam you can choose what you want to eat so maybe like eat sikit-sikit but
the real torture is like the person gave you nasi ayam okay you need to eat this nasi ayam for the next eight hours repetitively
orang boleh mati sia from exhaustion exhaustion exhaustion what other everyday activity that you wouldn't think is a torture but it's a torture if you do it for eight hours
I think washing your face like washing your face with a facial scrub lapan jam straight
kau punya kulit boleh dry sia
oh my god rabak gila actually anything that you do to do your body for eight hours ah
sometimes he dust it at eight hours so he thinks eight hours always like that now penat aku like clean the like you know he do the whole thing
I think ah ya I don't know why I thought of brushing teeth straightaway that's like ugh eight hours sakit sia gigi aku
teruk sia
aku macam ada high pitch moment uh bila excited macam ni so ya
apa sia
if it's for yourself macam
ya macam I
ya kau pernah other vulnerable component like you just you know I want to go on current god do you like the how is it whatever the I I also have
oh ya kau pernah like dengar kawan kawan kau ada third eye how is it for them like I I also have
ah of course wei menyusahkan sia
correct I but I don't know whether they can choose that option to tutup that batin I think
I think they maybe can but cannot go to bomoh lah go to an ustaz or something lah a skilled ustaz
I also have like my friend's friend ah dia pun boleh nampak benda so macam
it's not everytime akan ada benda but macam sometimes ah so macam tengah lepak ataupun
lepak kat luar pun nanti dia cakap eh ada benda ah kat situ ah atau dalam bilik macam alamak ada benda kat sini ah
are they constant tu or are they consistent
oh they want to scare you sia basically dah tak sui ah sis
oh I know him sia nak saja takutkan ni
ya ya boyfriend mana ni
oh I hate that everytime I ask about that ex you tak even refer nama dia kau just panggil dia misai
and I hate also that aku boleh macam oh ya as
though you only have one ex with one misai but
because his misai was the most evident ya
kau follow dia dekat social media ke tak
okay ada low key ah alright
okay so for me my unusual super power apa sia
I think ah the super power that siapa that
for like betul-betul like for bad people then like macam let's say this bad person was going to kill someone then
she can whisper them like macam you are not going to this you are going to try and believe in yourself you know
use it for really so the person that has that power has such as strong responsibility not to misuse it tau not for herself
like but we cannot macam do it for them as in for example a guy who is immature right we cannot be like
macam cheat code ah macam they don't go through the process so it's more like you are going to start going therapy
but then macam
and also macam I I get it like I also wouldn't want my partner to be misusing it on my child but
so ya but I mean it is messed up but messed up to a point that nak sampai divorce semua macam
chill lah like sort of like she rumour you tak berapa baik lah
kau ingat yang the part where ellen page pergi slice the car
ya ya ya but it's so kesian in the season two end up she never use but her husband irritating
kau just enjoy dia punya power habis kau nak use it the definition of toxic men sia babe aku throughout the movie aku just like
like get go I was trying to obviously give him the benefit of the doubt lah kan pasal dia macam
this like heroic black man but then as we go go through macam and he's not
luther sia aku prefer bluther with allison even though in the first season I was like meh but
dia tu baru cakap kau sayang citizen kau
yes one room flat but then nak kena ada conditions to pass lah so you must like graduate ini semua okay so if you haven't met that those conditions you still live with your parents
but then if you still haven't met that conditions then it's either kau can get the twenty one year old house ataupun stay with your parents
and then the last will be thirty years old which is like a five room flat because nanti kan semua dah ada anak semua apa
so it's all government dah macam plan untuk kau orang
and it's not like semua dapat what it's like there's conditions what so it's also it makes sense what right
ya that's why ya the ration is over there because the thing is with food is free obviously orang yang tak tamak okay lah kan
tapi kau imagine lah orang yang kau tahu kau tahu yang macam dah suka belum apa-apa dah pergi hog semua exactly kau imagine
ya takkan dia sapu
ya no food I think food can't be free I think if I really want one food that is free ah one thing that is free is ah ni sanitary pad
but condoms mana satu pun orang kasi free free per
so anyway uh babe uh kau wish aku lah ah untuk interview aku
eh babe thanks ah pasal kau macam berbual dengan aku semua so aku dah have a gauge
because  macam takde kawan gitu then  takde orang cam ajak but also  macam I want to like stay at home honestly cause like I really tired from like all the school work  berlambak kat like when you were studying
yay finally do you think  kita like  akan ada graduation ceremony
yeah  aku nak ambil gambar semua with like all my friends it will be memorable and
maybe but not so much lah because like I'm so tired of studying and the workload  banyak gila nak kena buat and  dengan  jugak
honestly I just finished my very last assignment then ya I didn't sleep that much honestly so I'm like taking a break  sekarang yeah
it was on my module quality management be ah  soalan dia anything to do with quality lah basically  macam there's something called balance scorecard that kind of thing you got learnt before ah it just  macam companies  guna like for
its quite a fun module ah do you got any module  yang kau enjoy
 tapi kau dulu pon kau cakap nak jadi pilot kan like or is that like not really
err I feel like err singapore airlines  rugi seh  kalau tak ambik kau cause like I feel like you very like you are capable ah of working there yeah I can I can foresee that you will do good in your job
tomorrow is tuesday right um honestly just stay at home like I want to  tengok my Netflix shows yeah
is there any Netflix show  yang kau tengah tengok sekarang like what what what is something that you are recommend me because like I don't know what to watch also actually
 suka sangat sampai tengok dua kali eh okay I'll like watch that maybe thanks for the recommendation

 mana ada beli beli a'ah
the module I mean the intern manager like yeah and the company's like it just saying that oh near this  ada students that will be working under you like that its just like it just a list lah that show that show who will be interning with me basically yeah
no no no but the thing is we are all separated into different different location so I'm gonna be alone ah which is  sedih yeah
 kau dah  carik err part time  punya kerja
no actually  aku enjoy seh
because like err  kau tau aku lah  aku memang suka duduk rumah aku memang pemalas nak keluar yeah and I feel like I can really rest cause you know sometimes when you go out you can be tiring like yeah like everyday we have to school right like even though its quite near but just lazy and but then one thing I don't like is the we have to study at home lah because its very hard to focus like I'm not gonna lie I slept during lessons before yeah
like thirty minutes like that yeah but its still manage to catch up on the lessons though lah I can still understand so okay lah but its very hard to focus then very hard to understand also at the same time then like  aku kan  pemalu kan so dah lah  nak kena press the recording then like its very hard because you don't want to interfere like when the teachers talking and all right yeah its a bit hard ah through teams all
 itu ah
quite manageable  tapi macam one or two modules  susah sebab ada maths yeah  susah sikit lah hmm
but alhamdulillah ada my friend is smart so she can help me
then  kadang kadang macam
 macam err  kau tak nak macam tanya soalan bodoh gitu so like
hmm honestly I want to  kerja tapi err my parents  nak me to go to uni first
which I mean I I don't mind  tapi nak kena tengok result  dulu lah cause you know uni kan  susah sikit kan like you have to be at least three point five and  walaupon macam three point five  pon
you might not get in also because the competition is too thight you know you have to compete with faci people and all so  macam aku pon takut lah but at the same time also  aku tak tahu nak buat course  apa yeah I I have to do a lot of research on my own lah but yeah everything now is like I'm unsure I just
 pandai pandai that's a smart idea yeah
oh yes like you know like I I was thinking about it I feel like I don't want to  kerja kat office I think that is so  macam stressfull because you have to deal with  orang lain some  orang tak kan  macam suka kau you know and then you have to deal with the boss I mean like you may or may not get a good boss you know you never know then yeah I mean like the working hours
I mean like it's it's tiring lah from what I see like I ask my sister right like how she work like she also have her own office drama  padahal dia tak buat apa apa macam ada orang macam just don't like her lah like especially since she got award she got an award right for being the best a good worker like this ah the person was like jealous of her and all so its like so annoying I don't know I think I want  aku nak jadi boss
I think that will be nice but business  tak tau ah  nak buka business  apa eh
oh yeah  aku nak jual apa seh
 tapi like what kind of cafe you know this kind of you want like like like some cafe they sell like lunch kind or lunch dinner ah like rice everything right but there is also the bakery kan of cafe with the coffee cake which one you want
yeah you know  macam orang dulu dulu cakap start jer  kecik apa  sikit sikit nanti err
at the west because all the cafes right now is is at the  dekat bugis  semua jauh kita kan  tinggal kat west kan  habis cam cafe  dekat sini is so limited so we should open one at our area yeah
 sekarang err  makanan apa ah  yang viral  sekarang
what is the trending food right now  apa apa lah  apa apa
oh yeah dekat Liho pon ada
 kau ada kau ada
kau ada instant coffee
ha okay then  kita boleh buat ah  nanti
err I think brown sugar right like everything also have brown sugar then I see  macam orang put the pearl  dekat pancake or something  macam semua benda nak kena ada pearl  macam a bit  merepek lah
yeah I mean  aku suka bubble tea but as just a drink is okay lah but once its like in completing in food I think it's weird but I don't know I've never tried but just the idea of it  macam merepek ah yeah
ha  aku sekarang tengah pokai  ni so  tunggu aku kerja dulu my intern  baru kita pergi you know have fun yes

but we never like eat any street food you know we eat like like proper restaurants but yet we still  macam diarrhoea  muntah muntah semua macam it's quite rabak seh
everything is nice actually is like singapore ah but you know their food  macam it's feels more homie feels more authentic like their  nasi goreng can imagine lah  macam very nice  dengan dia punya sambal dengan dia punya keropok is yeah you should try go there one day

oo ni tasha ya she got a supposedly free specs that eh that one I think ida did hers
cause it was such a long time just to choose which err apa
everything dah siap
later dekat waterway point I need to collect my stuff from her
then I have my all the two tudung
it thinks it easy but it's not I'm so busy with so many things so many things coming up my kacang having promo
macam dah tau kejap eh
yes we're planning to meet up for another another time once the teachers dah school holiday because semalam um haidar and ida still cannot make it their dia orang ada class eh bukan kelas dia orang ada um jumpa parent jumpa mak bapa
ourselves you guys only need to go out at night for teh mummies need to go out for lunch

K never mind like I dekat I I can't recall
it's so leceh
malas lah nak buat zoom zoom ni I'm not comfortable lah nanti
nanti I keep looking at the teacher while I dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat teacher nadia
just like sad that her malay teacher tu
cikgu melayu dia cikgu hafizah dah tak ada ah
err cikgu suhanis is there lah definitely she's
but I believe cikgu iza will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say cikgu suhanis is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then cikgu iza make it more interesting
when nadia is in P three err cikgu hafiza she's lucky because she knows cikgu hafiza even before she started
ah teaching her so cikgu hafiza already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
when when the teacher she tak suka
see like the I mean not apa
um dia punya prefect punya tu
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance eh her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her kakak
at least she got two to her ni to her name
ya dia suka panjat-panjat pe banyak pe they go hiking and everything but then sekarang
she's the one yang climbing all over the place
tak boleh loose out ke dia
dia takleh kalah you understand or not
that's why dia main game dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang jer tapi I think dah I rasa dah better lah sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh lah dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam iman main nak menang
then you nak nanti settle the boys
I don't know if see kalau tak sempat masak
macam penat lah nak masak ini hari I tak tahu nak masak apa
nanti you just get
but I think it sounds better to last night I think I didn't hear sangat
semalam I think dah kurang ah
nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum they they dia orang minum air putih
I think she's coming from sengkang I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later si mas ni
they've prepared so much so half a year later baru dah towards the end nak nak nak dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat
kalau tak nanti kelam kabut because kalau you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
because the thing is for me dia punya the the the problem sum lah
baik lah as long as it's not so expensive lah but I think this teachers are
okay boleh
okay lah boleh
ah next time me parents gateway you kena cepat-cepat kasi I tau
parents gateway punya details nanti kalau you dah start kerja I tak tahu apa-apa seh
the cikgu I mean the the and tasha tasha's teachers are using class dojo
like your what like what your sister was mentioning lah during this COVID it's best that they don't change classes because it's easier for contact tracing it's easier lah they don't want to ignore it because if not you have to go back and change back then the thing is our the girl also pun what like like tasha they she still moved around to
semuanya okay
oh aku baru balik dari batam meet my family during this COVID lah
some place most of the places is quiet lah some of them err ada yang dah tutup tak ada apa tu business kan some of them close
ah like massage parlours all dah tutup
a lot yang know like people with families lah with families I think affected them a lot orang some of them macam duduk kat kedai kopi hari-hari you know cannot do anything have to wait for this thing to be over kesian
so he dia dah tak dah takde kerja so he buat tu lah parking lah do the parking
tanam sayur kat kat kat apa dekat tu ah dekat tu kat barelang
tanam sayur dapat gaji lah sikit-sikit
ya yang macam kan normally kan over there when you park your car before you move kan ada orang datang they they call it orang tukang parking lah so they jaga to park jaga that parking area parking shift so one day I think the pay is about hundred thousand which is about singapore ten dollars
harvest already then after that jual ah kat pasar okay okay okay then other than that how's how's the the the the mall there the tourists there and the
what do you call it the massage spa abeh shopping centre
huh that means from singapore you have to fly to jakarta first then from jakarta quarantine for one night lepas tu duduk satu malam satu malam naik kapal terbang then pergi batam why never go batam directly from singapore take ferry
okay okay tanah merah because you know just recently I heard I read this news you know this singaporean that have not return back from singapore for seventeen years ah dia cakap macam macam nazi lah macam world war two lah kena halau sana halau sini I not sure whether it's true or not lah but
ah so maybe haven't come singapore seventeen years so he thought like macam nazi lah but so it's just a systematic that you just need to follow the whole sequence and then after that if you have any questions you just ask information lepas tu dia akan bilang mana nak pergi mana nak pergi sana pergi sini probably they are quite busy they are not suppose to talk much for for certain reason ah
ah okay lah because there is also people you know some you know from every you know now social media very strong right some people say stay in the hotel singapore not good and then some request to have balcony some request to have sentosa hotel I don't know lah these people sometimes I thinking if let say you want to prefer all these kind of thing then might as well don't come out from singapore in the beginning ah betul tak then just stay in singapore don't need to come out ya
okay lah alhamdulillah lah at least okay apa at least something kan daripada takde apa-apa then kalau kata orang tu kalau tak nak tak nak tak nak bayar then jangan lah keluar duduk kat singapore jer betul tak
oh abeh sekarang tengah buat apa lepak ah sekarang tak buat apa-apa ah
makan tidur makan tidur terus menjadi tau badan cannot no badan semua menjadi nanti have to go for exercise already have to keep fit already if not ah mati ah then what what what what what you doing later after this
okay lah you are become your own boss what now is your own boss ah err own own job own own money everything your own don't don't need to report to anybody what just report to the money the longer you work you get more money err but kerja kerja kerja sikit dapat sikit kerja banyak dapat banyak okay lah alhamdulillah lah kata orang kan
okay lah you control your own finances lah in a way that you can control your time then kalau ada apa-apa boleh habis siang kalau takde apa-apa boleh kerja lambat sikit so at least in a way
new year tahun ini jawapan dia duduk kat rumah diam-diam makan nasi lemak
betul betul betul I think now I heard this year countdown they won't be doing a main event like how they do previous year because they want to cut down the crowd lah so
apa-apa yang countdown semua dekat neighbourhood estate jer lah
I think I have the feeling that maybe they go by zoning lah macam north east south west ke apa so kat mana-mana yang okay kau tinggal north ada bunga api tinggal south ada bunga api west ada bunga api so instead of going to the central punya bunga api so everybody goes your own division their own area their own kampung to enjoy lah but anyway I mean
singapore bila
sixteen march ke
sixteen march dia orang tutup sixteen march sekali kira march april may june july august september november a'ah betul lah dah sembilan bulan ah
pejam celik pejam celik dah nine months dah nak masuk satu tahun
you no need to take sikit-sikit what what you can do okay because this hundred dollars is given in the denomination of ten but
you have to book through these five different platform okay err yang satu changi and then err I think trip err there's another three more lah aku tak ingat mana satu err then
can you can use hundred dollars full to offset your staycation in a hotel for yourself ah you can use that or you can use partly the only thing yang you cannot do yang kau tak boleh buat is kau buat stack up maknanya aku ada satu ratus kau ada satu ratus then kita combine dua ratus kita stay in hotel for free ah itu tak boleh tapi
kalau let's say that hotel is two hundred dollars but I only use my hundred dollars and then I can uh offset their hundred dollars I only pay four hundred dollars but I cannot stack up if I stack up ah that means I can get you me some other of my friends ten person then got one thousand dollars then I can stay in presidential suite already but cannot that's how they do it lah so in the domination of ten meaning let say kalau kau example kalau kau pergi zoo ke apa kan maybe zoo I don't know but now I'm not sure how much is the price maybe about twenty dollars then you just use ten dollars and then you know you you can use still pay ten dollars lah or maybe you pay you offset twenty dollars something like that ah tapi tak boleh combine lah that's how it goes but
I have the feeling they would be fully book and then hotels fully book you know tourist fully booked because a lot of people like to go so no need to kelam-kabut kata orang kan ah pelan-pelan ah next year pun boleh january pun boleh february pun boleh as long as pakai sebelum july lah so ya
kau belum pernah pergi sea aquarium ah eh talking about sea aquarium aku pun pernah pergi ah adventure cove
ah mampus
macam mana boleh tak orginal ada potong potong ke mampus kat mana ni kat batam ni indonesia lah
dia ambil they take a bit of commission a bit of a bit of help a bit right so at the end sampai orang punya tangan dah tinggal lima ratus jer ah kurang ah wah ini macam pun boleh eh mati
mampus take advantage of the whole situation lah to get something ah
takut daripada negative jadi positive
macam-macam ah eh sekarang ni
oh ya ya saiful one so touching ah I didn't know that he will do that video was like I was like what he really record down the video he say he miss his wife who is in then after that what he did he he go and purchase the binoculars two binoculars one for him one for his wife he send to his wife then after that pergi kat semberang tambak johor and and one of them dekat woodland one of them dekat johor dekat apa tu tempat tu eh eh

err saiful wedding then along the way I think because of this COVID semua tarik-tarik then in the end decided not to go when the announcement came that those who goes to singapore ah those from singaporean goes to overseas come back have to do quarantine have to do swab everything then become viral so in the end tak jadi pergi but alhamdulillah they get married in singapore first before the main one at malaysia what so kat malaysia semua cancel kan everything cancel because of this COVID ya ya ya true true true this year ya I think ya ya after that ah I think during that period still
people are still was-was fifty fifty whether to go or not to go to go or not to go then after that

no but singapore pun ada

hello this is recording pertama kita bersama saya wesley because this is our first recording okay I akan explain apa jer yang kita akan berbual so please bear dengan kita kita err recording ini akan berlangsung selama satu jam so every recording kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
bersama conversation partner yang I dah pilih
so err untuk conversation ini yang pertama sekali I have my own sister nama dia rismah okay
so for this recording's conversation partner err rismah akan uh introduce herself you can start now
okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation eh ah terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan err bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih lah kita tergantung uh it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar jer uh this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango jer when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa jer
I happen to like mango juga so uh bila dengar mango jer kan macam woo sedap ah like
rasa macam wah
macam nak makan jer mango eh macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango jer macam nak makan sahaja so uh first jer kita uh bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar jer macam rasa
I don't know if you've uh I don't I don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik I memang suka pakai baju mango this T shirt from this brand nama dia mango err by the way ini
tak sponsored lah eh so kita ya faham-faham jer
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay jadi err buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
um it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
mm so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu jer macam
apa uh we slice it we we can just slice the
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay lah macam kan macam tak
uh selain daripada besides the shape
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so err these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
err yang paling sedap
I honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because I've only tried
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so uh the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana eh mango ini
dalam context singapore eh kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
mana mana mesti ada lah mango
kadang ah sometimes there are like fruit sellers that just
just so that they can sell their their fruits lah gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual lah
literally dekat stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live err somewhat we we kinda all live near an station betul tak
err besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
err as in it's very easy to find mango lah dekat singapore ini kan pasal it's it's a common fruit
product apa jer yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa um tak tahu lah
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot eh macam yang rasa mango I I tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam uh shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
ah lip balm pun ada
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh teh yang berperisa mango err mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's err
it has calming effects uh I don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi err definitely
I bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so err apa lagi eh
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
but kita belum sentuh ini
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
entah eh when okay when the colour the colour of the mango kan yellow kan
bila the first thing when you see
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is betul-betul attractive
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour bingsu like she said uh she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour bingsu macam
ee nak ah tengok macam the first thing I see is the the
apart from that I feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup eh macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice ah texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
I mean uh we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula kan
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal bingsu sebagai dessert
apa lagi eh
um maybe itu jer kot maybe that's all we have for mango products err I mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
uh itu macam
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
cuma word mango jer kot I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam wah nampak jer macam wah
uh besides that uh kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul I feel like ah okay but honestly I think err
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause I feel that
entah eh
the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
like at your friend's house mesti ada err
because kita tak pernah I mean jarang lah ya berbual pasal mango that's what I find it interesting kalau kita berbual untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
tak pernah ada kan
I really wish ada mango soda
um that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
uh do you know that uh in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
so besides that uh okay the the scientific name eh untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
kan uh ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
okay so it means ah okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji err biji buah dia itu memang besar
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
uh southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
how interesting is that macam
lama gila seh like what the hell
now we're born okay at this point of time I have no idea what I'm talking about but kita go on jer eh
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia uh lain-lain
an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
err mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
means that err selain kita besides kita besides
and then apa lagi eh
okay in this website yang I dah cari ini dia kata err in fact studies link
err digestive health and eyesight dan juga has a lower risk of certain cancers
okay nak tahu tak uh nutritional value dia
okay so calories sembilan puluh sembilan
one point four grams gitu lah
carbs err twenty four point seven grams habis dia punya lemak dia is zero point six grams
lagi eh okay dietary fiber two point six grams
copper wah banyak eh dia punya nutritional dia copper err twenty percent of the folate eighteen percent of the
apa itu tak pernah dengar but sure seven percent of the potassium six percent of the riboflavin
thiamine four percent of the dengan magnesium four percent of the
okay err dia dia bilang dekat sini it also contains small amounts of phosphorus panthothenic acid
selain daripada itu mango pun is very high in antioxidants okay
okay enough in the nutritional facts we are left with three minutes to talk about mango and maybe the next thirty minutes kita boleh berbual-bual pasal buah-buah buah-buah lain lah pula eh
okay experiences dengan buah mango eh
I don't know every experience I had with buah mango is quite interesting because
I always have mango bingsu dengan kawan-kawan ke dengan siapa-siapa betul tak what about you do you have any uh interesting experiences dengan buah mango
um betul I think she's right
memang I think buah mango ini senang busuk eh and dia masak cepat so
ya just just bila dah beli itu when you
uh as uh your fridge ke tapi it doesn't have to be in the fridge also lah I mean orang tiap-tiap orang it depends right oh and err talking about experience dengan mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes macam potong-potong mango habis taruh dekat dalam freezer
woo dah keluar macam
semi frozen macam entah sedap macam ice you know
betul that's I agree strongly dengan uh whatever that she said and also oh my god I can't believe I forgot about this
exactly itu pasal okay like okay let's just talk about it I suka mango ice cream yang dia dekat yang ada macam popsicle itu
oh my god bila you take one bite dia macam
wah panas-panas makan itu sedap seh macam seriously like that's the best
betul I don't know
cara you explain macam a bit weird tapi tak apa lah eh I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize kalau topic dia macam lame sangat but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
take a break from mango topic because uh whoever that is going to listen this for one hour mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal mango betul tak so let's hear about your day what have you done today
question dia tadi satu question eh tapi dah melalut eh tak apa it's okay
okay this week actually is my first week err since err holiday that school resumes so err as per usual I had my class today tapi because you know kan sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases lah kan so today we had
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
okay back to the topic err seriously I think quite sad because dah berapa bulan seh dekat rumah like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like ah I can just think and do work
much more than I can do work at home macam macam mana eh macam susah lah buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi err productive lah but today is uh
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay jer lah I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
I had sambal fish and sambal egg
then err ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun eh ke suun
I think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like um
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so I think that's what it is then apa lagi eh um ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today um because you know uh work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then err lepak lepak dah itu jer
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about apa eh apa yang best eh nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
um kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very err much the same as hers um it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song lah macam okay that song is my favourite song
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have jadi macam bila dengar jer macam oh my god my emotions semua keluar but like
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between err western songs dengan
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain lah you you you get what I mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then um my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat kot that is the one that's very popular
I I would say lagu um
uh dah lupa tajuk dia
ah I tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called mevoy M E V O Y daripada eh the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
apa lagi eh ah oh ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I main asal asal jer
sebarang ah apa lagi eh okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man I have a lot of groups that I like
then err okay I also because err this is my family is an um indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga lah so err
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga eh macam they have err songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre ah koplo oh my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat
lagi eh ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
I mean I'm I'm feeling it right now cause ya I mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid lah pasal kita berbual pasal makan kan so automatically as human beings kan kita first thing berbual pasal makan jer mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but eh tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh kan I tak pernah seh pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
it's okay I mean err okay kalau macam okay err for me kan kalau makanan favourite I is
I categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu I like err
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
I okay comfort food ini kan is the the the category for comfort food ini kan is the type of food that I can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time I can just I can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal err the food that really like macam
okay so my first one my comfort food eh is bakso mi bakso I don't know if you guys know that
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia I'm not so sure dekat brunei pun I tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food err mi bakso
I would have a lot of sambal to go with it and I also have ah pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in um english is basically just a fried wanton lah kan
I know it's like a little bit like whoa apa sia
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when I have money that I'll get that
kalau tak no usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
I feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat I mean kalau macam birthday jer kan macam confirm
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that I love the K
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi eh

and they are english language which is what I'm really fluent in then apa itu
I juga boleh eh I pun boleh berbual bahasa melayu lah macam normal cause we're singaporeans kan I'm born here
um berbual bahasa melayu just a normal thing but kita pun boleh berbual bahasa indonesia because
my family's is an indonesian family so kita my
uh next fluent or I would say a native language would be bahasa indonesia actually
because uh that's that's how I was raised I actually berbual
um my parents' native languages like dia orang punya bahasa asal dia orang which is
err bahasa sunda dengan bahasa jawa so my mom speaks sundanese and my dad speaks javanese so

nanti nanti you you choose ni masa you nak log in ke macam masa bila
oh masa log in baru you choose

so K ni dah tahu
tak lah macam okay masa you dah masuk dalam
ah then cause sometimes inside kan masa you tengah tengah scroll scroll sana tengah tengah meeting ke apa and then sometimes you just want to wipe
apa eh
you nak show you punya itu ke
sometimes kan cause they have the host kan host boleh share screen kan
ah sometimes then kita nampak screen si host kan abeh sometimes kalau macam mana kita nak macam
nak show kita punya ke ataupun I just want to say eh eh so this is mine then how do I show
ah tak nak lah
ee ee kalau okay first masa you join
then you taruk you don't want video
after lepas tu you dah masuk then after that you can you change to like you want video or you have to like rejoin
kena go out balik
no no but then ini when you first join kan takut you join with video or without video
cause so if let's say you dah you dah pilih okay no video
then halfway through you nak change boleh tak
but just now I remember tak boleh sini
ah tu masa starting lah masa dia tu
ye lah ye lah can can can can
ah ni mummy tak tahu
eh eh oh ni dia under kat mana more eh
dah record then aku kat mana

ye lah
oh okay okay macam mana
boleh choose okay okay this is one option yang bagus lah
ah macam mana
leceh lah eh okay lah okay okay okay
learning learning takpe tengah belajar
bagus juga eh
macam-macam juga function dia sometimes mummy tak pakai banyak
mummy just tengok macam you know just just listen and then and answer if necessary that's all
quite quite ada function juga eh
tu lah bagus lah must learn ah then I can use
ini yang hantar orang ah link tu eh invite people for meeting eh
cuma mummy rasa ni bagus sikit pasal ni quite macam quite user-friendly you can figure out lah eh kan
ni better I think okay lah quite okay manageable lah kalau you tak tahu pun you macam boleh agak-agak ni ke apa ke kan mm
ah lah tadi
ada macam alah macam team bonding ke
takpe lah cause of this technical thingy tapi tapi boleh lah juga
actually okay except for some people had trouble problem macam tiba-tiba eh tiba-tiba hilang abeh then
bila dia nak start something new activities kan then he they have to like everybody go into that uh use that that thing tu ada problem sikit lah
kita ada macam apa tu escape room tadi
ada abeh kita cari clue actually interesting juga lah
macam um kita used to go macam room kan tapi ni virtual tau tapi
it's find clues sama lah so instead of open up the box apa kan then you just virtually open the box the click and then dapat clue dia then you click newspaper ni dapat clue ni
you see ada
ah ye lah ye lah ye lah macam lah alah itu kan normal escape room macam you dah ambil clue then okay you go to different stages okay you dapat ni solve the first one
okay then you go to the next step then go to the next room ah then sampai the end okay then you solve the the problem
okay lah tadi cuma time lah you must go you must you must really ikut timing lah timing dia macam quite short abeh kita the clues sometimes you really have to like
really tengok apa dia sometimes kita ingat kan it's something cheem tau sekali alamak it's just that that first few letters of the the sentence then you can figure out okay actually what is it
tapi kita pun baca dia punya poem I thought the poem is something to do with the poem kita gi decipher the poem to know actually no need it's just there
tak macam dia nak kasi digit okay you click this okay in this room find the three guard three digit number for you to open up the door
it gives you seven like but then we were just reading the poem kita baca apa poem ni ada tree lah ada women passing by apa lah apa sekali takde terus after that I think we took some time abeh orang tu kasi clue lah actually you don't have to decipher the poem you just it's just there you just look at the poem
sekali one of us oh okay okay I can see number seven
but you baca macam kita betul we read sentence by sentence what's the meaning maybe you know tak ada tak payah you just baca jer kat situ you just see the number the S the E and V and dah
I think escape berapa eh tadi eh satu jam eh

but err as in my first day  pergi sekolah physically
first day  pergi sekolah physically
okay that one aku kena tanya achin dulu
kalau dia confirm ke tidak sebab dia tu last minute ada perangai sikit so she's always like last minute tak boleh or boleh so ya
he won't be coming because dia kerja
the best is we we need to ask them apa dia orang prefer eh is it they want to buy first or they nak order tapi kalau order pun leceh I don't think the rider can go up betul tak
then nak kena turun then kalau satu orang order lain-lain kedai
so wati jer lah belum confirm
okay so to lah ni
if the rest tak boleh make it kan I mean dayah can join lah bawa anak dia cause if if it's just the three of us
but but honestly ada orang tak suka
honestly aku cakap dengan kau ada orang tak suka
okay kau tahu kita tengah recording
okay why not kita just give
apa the leeway untuk bawa anak dia so that macam
since macam susah sangat untuk dia dapatkan orang untuk jaga kan and dia tak biasa orang lain jaga anak dia so why not
bawa jer anak dia but then engkau lah yang kena jadi macam discipline mistress
dia complain kat kau ke
okay I understand where you're coming from lah macam kau tak nak kawan-kawan kita nampak anak dia punya attitude macam gitu
kau yang last masuk aku masuk dulu so salah engkau
I mean it's a get together so might as well you you order a dessert selepas makan there's a pencuci mulut
ah then sambil tu berbual berbual gossip gossip kan
ah story story cerita cerita lama ah
ya ya aku pun perasan
maybe she just want to lead a private life lah macam tak nak share most of her personal stuff with uh us
ya like I said ada orang macam dia okay ada orang kau tahu macam
err I'm not into this kind of thing anymore macam no reunions for me I I just wanna lead and love my own family macam ya
macam senyapkan diri ke apa ya ada orang macam gitu kita kena respect juga lah kan
sorry lepas aku dah beranak ni I will need to shut you out from my life
biasa lah mister husband
so apparently achin pun nak kerja ni
like macam
insurance agent aku nak berbual

TAQWA is very err kira dah well known already

the body all still sapau lah
dia recognise kau tak
kawan dia girl ke boy sia
sekali dia cakap ya you look like totoro sia
ada any latest photo of him
oh thirty six baya safari lah
people who work as influencers selalu macam gitu like think about it singaporean pun banyak influencer pe yang like they don't really do much like you know all the pretty chinese girls on Instagram
fast paced I guess I used to play a lot of I started with um apa tu
uh I started with BlackShot then like I used to play my with friends in the computer lab when the teacher wasn't looking then we started playing BlackShot together then from then I started playing two like I got tell you before right I started playing two with my uh primary school guy friends cause we used to walk back from together then you know sama-sama right then when you get back home also we together we play like two together lah then we didn't study much but that's besides the point then uh I remember one time like he was teaching me how to
I stopped playing for a while oh no I also played Halo two at my friend's house a lot ya that was like cause you know I got primary school punya clique kan then kita used to go to his house like my friend's name is hadziq then we used to go to his house during the holidays then we would go there and we would play Halo two then how it works is that you know the screen then on top got the like player one then below got player two so it was a split screen then dah kecil kan then my like you can see the difference between people's proficiencies side by side then like I was running around trying to find my friend right cause I wanna shoot her then she was she was walking then she stop then she had to turn the other controller eh the other what do you call it joystick ya she had to turn the other joystick and then she walked then she stopped then she turned the joystick so she cause she couldn't like like like coordinate her hands or something so ya I ended up beating her a lot so
like he really he really suka macam game game lah macam gitu then he will always buy stuff like new games or like he'll put like emulators uh into his computer and stuff then you just attach the
better like it's pretty good ah I don't know if it's still that good now I guess it's just I got used to it you know dah biasa
the ratio was really off it was like twenty girls ten guys or I think nineteen girls eleven boys something like that ya it's pretty bad then they will always play together then I also was interested lah then one time they ajak me then like like we started playing together then that's why they taught me how to play PUBG
but I felt kind of bad lah I was quite a team burden back then but that's just because uh I wasn't used to the game I think but it was really fun apa tu uh selalunya selepas exam or selepas sekolah then kita just you know there's like convenience stores usually right ya then we would go there then kita makan sama-sama then after we finish like eating then we just play PUBG together lor it was nice it was like one of my favourite memories from ya ya it was damn ah it was really nice lah I like thinking about it
combination of a lot of their own consoles they just kind of improved on the design sikit-sikit
four four four or three it was I was super young then I went to uh my makcik's house siapa eh
ya so I think I stopped playing that I was thinking of getting Smash also though like I don't know I didn't know if it would translate well onto the Switch Lite or not cause I know a lot of people would prefer to play it like on the screen then some more like kalau
your friends come over or something then you know you would want to play on the big screen together I guess so that's why I didn't get Smash ya I got Mario Odyssey instead ya and then I ordered uh Stardew Valley the one that's macam uh Harvest Moon ya but I ordered it like what two weeks ago or a week ago then the store hasn't contacted me I need to them on Facebook I think
tak ah aku beli kat uh you know
ya then dia orang ada website pe so I just searched up the game there then aku cari cari cari and I think kena like they have to ship it out from somewhere else then like aku faham ah like it takes awhile to ship stuff over to singapore but like two weeks is a bit of a long time then they never contact me then they said like I went onto the website yesterday in class then I was like uh searching if they had like any issues with the shipping cause of COVID right then uh apparently if the store doesn't contact I need to contact them either on Facebook lor I need to email then I don't know do you think it's better if I email or if I on Facebook
if I send an email also maybe tak baca that's the thing right I ordered a day six album like in
days gone by punya era like the retro punya ah
aku order march kan then sekarang dah
like dah nak dekat november
ya but I don't think they meant to scam me lah I think they just genuinely forgot about it then uh I need to get a refund probably but I've already waiting so long then macam paiseh sikit to you know
maybe cause they have more people so it's more spread out I guess then maybe that's why they got more time to enjoy enjoy sikit
january like even before my birthday seh then ya it's it's so early I mean it's good lah maknanya like they get to
abeh kalau bukan april what's the on after that
I think I think I understand what the commando thing is because set lin's brother was like commando in ya in it's kind of ironic because they're not singaporean but you know as in like they weren't born in singapore ya ya they're burmese oh ya ya ya ya ya that's why his name is so weird set lin ya then um they became singaporean like they got singaporean citizenship then his brother was commando then uh if I'm not wrong right they are the ones who are most likely to risk their life when it comes when it's like going to be war lah like they're the ones doing the more dangerous stuff so that's why like when people do that's what that's that's usually what they think about lor it's like do I really want to risk my life for this certain role it's a good role like there's a lot of honour that comes with it but also like a lot of thought lah like what if singapore actually does goes go to war then you know macam sedih lah to see to have your mother worry about you you know while they're back home ya then I remember at HeadRock
malaysia tak tahu honestly tak ada ah thailand thailand dia orang macam draw lots sia I think I remember cause apa itu bam bam went to thailand back to thailand then he was or was it ten they were like sitting together then they were like waiting for it to happen then they just draw draw draw draw the lots then after that end up both of them don't need to go
when it happened it felt macam hunger games seh honestly like why don't you just drawing why why do you gather everyone there to draw lots like just do it like I don't know in an office then hantar letter kirakan like so
so pelik to have everyone there macam
oh yang uh grave of the fireflies
itu sedih gila sia no it's because macam it's
my uh apa itu arwah nyai uh she came from indonesia then dia naik
aku ingat dulu kan it was like a big ship like a big ship then she just hopped on and then she rode to singapore but no she naik sampan sampan kecil dari indonesia jawa like she took that sampan all the way to singapore with like I don't know one like a few of my aunts and uncles my mum wasn't born yet my mum was born in singapore then she came all the way to singapore ya then like my arwah datuk was a security guard or something ya
she told me during the war like they the japanese would always like seek out very pretty girls ya so like she knew like her neighbours they would purposely macam apa eh uh mud ya they would take mud and then they would just rub it on their faces trying to make themselves look very very dirty cause they don't want to look like appear attractive to any of the japanese soldiers lah then that was quite scary then had to ration out food also that was the worst then you know my mother she used to I don't know lah like like they were really it was really really like they were really poor
then makan apa-apa jer lah cari dapat daun ke apa then ambil jer lah makan jer
ya then she but they always tried to have lauk lah like uh even back then you know
in canteens or something people selalu makan nasi taruk kicap kan but
like even back then I don't know why ah but that family of theirs they never did that they at least have like one kuah to eat together ya cause I think
even though they were poor my arwah nyai didn't want them to feel poor you know like at least have something lah had something there to eat together then ration out lor as much as possible ya
serious it was it was a sampan kecil aku I swear I ingat I thought it was like gonna be a really big ship then I talked to my sister about it then she said you realise it was a sampan right like it wasn't a big ship then I was like huh how she fit inside the sampan then she said oh like the same way everyone else does ah you just squeeze together then just hope for the best ah then can you imagine how many days that would take from freaking indonesia all the way to singapore on a sampan with other people some more
then ya then she came to singapore I mean either way they would have gone they would have gone to indonesia anyway ya but it's okay lah if my arwah nyai didn't come to singapore in that sampan I would still be
jawa so
but my mum a bit merepek seh like you know that time japan kena tsunami and like earthquake it was pretty bad right the
uh apa eh
macam tak kena ah ah
mm okay ah four hundred thousand but but still fifteen thousand out of that much is still quite a lot right then um there were a lot of people saying that they saw a lot of the spirits of the people who died ya but weren't like harmful lah they were more of like they were very lost like a lot of them said that like the hantu-hantu ini semua dia orang
I may have watched a malay drama about it like this girl was a victim and then she moved like she became like I don't know ah she had foster parents or something then she grew up with them then you kahwin orang kaya or something I don't know but anyway cause of that I learnt more about the like the thing that happened ya it was really bad like it devastated
you know cause of the water and then like kasihan lah cause
I think belum eh
ya uh for I read somewhere I think on reddit uh ada orang kata bila dia tinggal kat zone
under had more amenities or something ya or it was decorated nicer lah but at the same time it's also because has a lot of financial backing cause since they're the super majority so it's kind of like a grey area of like maybe they do want to do a lot more but they just don't have the means you know then it's kind of like I don't have the means to show you but I can show you I can't and at the same time you know mm politics macam confusing ya
I don't know why she went to when she could have gone overseas though I guess why she just wants to be back here since she was overseas for a while ya but her friends from her international school ada yang pergi uh mana
ya international school lah so they're kaya gila lagipun we were supposed to go overseas
tiga kali seh supposed to go overseas bangkok tak jadi then malaysia tak jadi then japan pun tak jadi
I think yang paling heart pain was that we couldn't see the tokyo olympics cause we were supposed to if we could have gone this year then like okay lah memang kita boleh pergi japan any other year but the problem is that we can't always go when the olympics are happening you know and then dah lah like how do we how do you even get tickets to go to the olympics
aku pun I mean like I was willing to settle for kita just stay in malaysia overnight seh or like for a few nights then to pun tak boleh literally a week before we went lucky I asked if we could get a refund or not just in case
sedih gila it wasn't even just border tutup seh border tutup then circuit breaker fuh terus my my mood just plummeted
then next year internship dengan mampus
okay alamak leceh ah tadi dah sedap-sedap berbual itu lah dah nak dekat tiga minit kita berbual nak buang air liur jer
kenapa angelina tak nak ambil ini eh diploma in apa diploma in children punya studies apa
tapi it takes time apa masa of course like everyone I think like that lah I think macam eventually kalau macam dah get used to it nanti dah tak awkward apa
oh dah submit eh
habis izz nanti ni ah
ulang-alik ulang-alik ah ambil
kat mana eh poly mana
nanti kakak bulan tiga kakak dah start kakak punya course
kat bras basah and err tu yang course yang dia orang nak hantar ni advance certificate in earliest
ah dia orang nak hantar tak certificate tapi by right kakak punya actually I can
I can apply for another cert ah certificate in early childhood tapi kakak tak tahu kenapa the company sent me for this advanced certificate in early years which is err ni ah I think dia orang punya difference is
gaji wise
actually I prefer to take ace apa the other cert the pasal with that cert I actually can teach older children ah
pasal kalau kakak ambil one there's only a limit I can only take err handle kids two months to eighteen months jer
I cannot go for those older kids teach them eh curriculum tak boleh why kalau infant
kita nak ajar apa seh
tu ah tidur kasi makan
tapi tapi ah yang childcare aniq kan offer kakak dia cakap nanti after your course eh ah after you serve your one year punya bond with your company you come and look for me lah dia cakap tadi dia cakap dengan kakak
tapi I prefer here pasal dia orang punya
okay pasal every different different school they have their own different approach tau nak ajar so for this school is play based
my company they focus more on relationship base habis tadi kakak tanya principal principal cakap what is the relationship based curriculum
tak tahu it's just more communication ah with you and the kids ah so but I still prefer nya method because it's play based student learn develop through play
cakap habis dia macam ya whatever lepas tu dia macam why don't you come and work for me lah after your one year punya bond lah
I cakap inshallah lah lepas tu I cakap tapi the plus the downside is dia orang tak sponsor for studies the reason why I take up this company is because dia orang sponsor
go for it eh tapi macam
nak tahu juga dia punya pay wise is it
then tak payah kerja dulu lah since you like belum ada komitmen kan belum ada anak
just go for full time studies jer lah dah kumpul cukup duit tak if you dah kumpul cukup duit then you just go for full time studies better for you because cepat habis instead of that one year maybe six months
of course lah definitely lah that time kakak kan cakap dengan izurin lah kan yang masa korang kahwin kan I told izz if you want to apply for house I can actually recommend the agent okay the agent cakap dengan kakak for now izz tak boleh beli rumah yang
dia punya income now is actually not enough to buy a four room dia actually nak apply rumah four room daerah rumah kakak yang lama tu dekat kan
then err dia cakap then where can he apply lah but actually izz can only get rumah yang dekat boon lay taman jurong dia macam rumah lama old flat lah really old flat
ah tapi macam tempat dia pun not
cakap macam the area not really that
cakap tak apa lah then ah izz cakap tak apa lah tunggu lah tunggu then dah kahwin mana tahu dapat boleh apply
lagi ni but I guess I think sekarang market pun more for buyer punya seller market kira seller untung ah buyer kena keluarkan lebih sikit duit
sembarang sahaja lah cakap sahaja lah janji boleh hit that one hour nya ni minute
ni lagi satu nampak benda bukan-bukan semua pakai tudung jer aku tengok
itu lah I think kakak kak ika ah yang mak cakap yang tadi kita berbual kak ika ah menantu menantu wak jenab
toast belt toast box eh ah toast box ke apa yang kedai makan yang ada jual roti kaya ada breakfast pagi punya ada telur rebus
ah mak suka lopong dekat situ kakak tak tahu kenapa cakap dengan mak mak tidur ni tak jatuh ke dekat tepi mak cakap susah nanti nak nak sapu sampah cakap sapu jer lah
berat lah nak angkat-angkat cuba kakak suruh mak buang ni
this one dah lama sini masa kita baru masuk sini kan pindah was like in two thousand
two thousand berapa eh
two thousand one two thousand lepas kakak habis sekolah kan
two thousand one tak salah kakak kita pindah baru dah berapa lama sekarang dah I think twenty years
ah tadi angelia nak cakap apa
yang yang pakai ada bangs eh tudung
of course lah izz tak bawa pergi jalan-jalan macam mana nak pergi COVID
dia cakap apa tak cakap ah tak berbual lah
tu lah kak ika she's not a local she I don't know whether she's already converted to singapore citizen pasal dia dia daripada batam she's an indonesian she's an indonesian
but dia punya berbual you can actually know that she's not here she's not from here dia ada masih walaupun dia sekarang dah
dia dah tinggal lama dekat sini kan but then her accent still have that that that indonesian accent ya
dia tinggal dekat boon lay kan dengan wak jenab

err but she have three kids ah err tiga orang abang
abang baby nombor dua eh abang ram nombor dua nombor tiga yang bongsu abang baby
the first one tak ada

dia nak jaga budak tapi tak nak jaga tak nak tukar pampers macam berak ni semua tak dia tak buat
dia belum kahwin tau budak tu younger than me ah very young I think about your like your age
dia macam suka main handphone pasal kakak perasan ah bila macam kakak pergi outdoor activity ada dengan class dia dengan kawan dia on the handphone tak jaga budak-budak budak main-main dia on the handphone
kena complaint lah kan sikit hari kan kita ada this centre planning day right ah last week so the the principal brought up all the feedback from the parents ah so dia indicate ada one of the parents ah teachers always on the phone terus kakak cakap wow okay sekali bila kakak jalan kakak pasal kakak keluar dengan lagi dua orang kan two more teachers so like the my friend was like pointing ah at my colleague dia cakap
handphone dia tunjuk tangan begini handphone lah this one lah this one handphone lah habis macam oh okay yang kena complaint dia orang lah dua ni
senyap hmm
sama sama jer like no difference jer like normal lah
ah tapi
tak lah okay jer
tak all the pregnancy macam okay jer tak ada apa-apa jer macam I don't have any anxiety bila nak beranak
macam okay lah beranak beranak okay lah lah beranak ah I don't know why some people eh macam very nervous ah nervous padahal macam tak ada apa-apa jer macam kan macam is it just me or what like err ya tak ada masalah apa-apa just like lay in a bit lepas tu cakap oh time nak sakit sakit lah but the first
I use epidural ah because they said it's very painful very painful I cakap oh I I I don't have eh for mesti tak boleh handle punya lah so cakap ah so when the doctor asks
nak pakai epidural tak then I just say go yes epidural that's why bila macam I mm mm I got one friend off of four pregnancies she never used epidural tapi dia cakap sakit memang sakit lah tapi bila bila masuk beranakkan anaqi
I didn't get to use the epidural apa
then lepas tu I macam it's not really that painful what a'ah ah pasal
err on that day itself yang err abang nasir nasib baik abang nasir tak kerja
so lepas kakak ada macam this craving nak makan sambal pizza sambal pizza ikan bilis tau macam Domino's nya that time so I ate that then macam sakit perut cakap ah nak berak dah tau padahal dah dah due date itself so tak terfikir nak patah balik hospital
so ah then kakak nak tidur lah cakap sakit perut macam nak berak tapi tak berak ah tidur ah tidur sekali macam bangun pukul tujuh lebih eh tujuh setengah like that cakap eh kenapa macam lain macam tau sakit perut macam nak meneran-meneran so I pergi toilet tak keluar pun eh then sakit perut dia macam semacam macam datang tiba-tiba sakit dia contraction cakap eh ni ah maybe this is the time lah
pergi dengan lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir I think we need to go to hospital send send the kids dekat dalam kereta kakak tak boleh tahan tau macam tak boleh jalan cakap eh sakit perut semacam lah
lepas tu cakap dengan abang nasir ah err tak boleh tahan ah so along the way pergi dari sini rumah mak pergi
abang nasir kita kakak dah diam tau pasal abang nasir try to talk to me then I just like don't want to reply cakap ah err ya lah um macam please don't talk to me because I don't have the mood to talk I cakap itu ah so on the way I tengok kat tingkap eh bila nak sampai seh bila nak sampai this is like this is this baby is torturing me sampai dekat hospital tak boleh jalan so kakak cakap dengan abang nasir I think you have to get the wheelchair for me I cannot walk
so duduk dekat wheelchair ah sorong naik dekat labour ward
nurse macam tanya uh how is what is your pain score
I cannot say already ah err dia macam ingat kakak bedek-bedek tau cakap just a little bit ah cakap lepas tu dia macam hegeh-hegeh ambil my data err dia cakap can you walk no I cannot walk I really cannot walk I cannot stand okay nevermind lah I help you sekali dah pergi naik atas nak check dia cakap eh baby head come out already tapi kakak rasa macam nak berak ah ah sakit macam nak berak tapi kakak tak ada macam mm nak berak nak bersalin macam tu kind crying no no crying you know
so doctor err nurse masa tu doctor belum sampai pun
so nurse cakap you wait ah you don't push ah because baby dah keluar kan habis you cannot tahan apa so I just I cannot tahan already I rasa I want to push now ah cakap no no no no don't wait for the doctor first dia tahan kakak begini seh cakap no no no no sekali I don't care whoa terus menjerit baby keluar ah baby come out already ah lantak lah buat bodoh tapi actually tak sakit pada kakak
so then bila dah beranakkan aniq pun tak sakit eh sakit sakit juga I think aniq was like the less pain the least painful lah of one aniq I was like struggling a bit because tapi tak nangis lah it's just that tak boleh keluar macam I I think kakak masuk malam pagi pukul satu ke dua
then err sampai esok petang baru kakak beranak
kalau dah doctor nak ni apa pergi caesarean then I told her I don't want I think I want to walk because I feel like it's like I've been on the top of the bed tak gerak so the thing cannot go out apa
so I cakap ah I cakap dengan doctor ah can I just walk
no no you cannot walk you have to stay on the bed if not anything happen then we not responsible dia tak kasi jalan
tapi pasal I think about the same ah sama jer ah then my friend cakap pakai laughing gas ya use laughing gas tengok I don't laugh what
my friend cakap dia pakai tau kakak pakai macam biasa okay jer tak ada apa-apa boring dia cakap dia cakap ada ketawa dia high
ah then abang nasir pakat lah cakap you use this one ah tahan your err masa yang beranakkan aniq ni lah macam sama jer tak ada beza habis nurse cakap lah kat me dia cakap you must use properly you must inhale right then I said what I inhale I inhale what
abang nasir sampai dah tertidur hmm habis tak keluar-keluar dah keluar belum sakit belum habis check check the machine right kakak rasa macam contraction point contraction point hmm okay lah macam rasa tak tak okay jer cakap but the contraction got got some ni tau movement ah eh tak rasa pun doctor sampai keluar masuk sharifah how is your pain
cakap you sure or not you six already eh ya four
wah really ah good ah you cakap okay lah then sekali bila macam eh how come your dia pasal dia cepatkan dia punya ni tau err dia orang pakai oxytocin lah nak cepatkan dia punya err labour it's still the same
dah dah dah dah pecahkan water bag
letak oxytocin sama juga so doctor cakap if you are bad err I give you two more hours if by by this time ah if you never err have any pain err caesarean terus macam huh I don't want caesarean don't want don't want okay I will try I'll try my best
a'ah lepas tu cakap eh budak ni tak nak keluar kot tidur dekat dalam dah dah best dekat dalam
abang nasir cakap ni kalau tak ni kena pergi push bawa naik ward ni nak kena caesarean lepas tu kakak cakap tak nak ah habis dah macam buat kelakar habis abang nasir cakap buka lah buka habis dia tidur dekat sebelah kakak macam eh nak berbual eh tak ada orang tak berbual
beranak habis if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe tak sakit lah pada kakak pain threshold kakak memang high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma I think that time masa first punya pregnancy kan orang mesti cakap sakit sakit actually macam tak apa
it's not really that painful then orang cakap sakit tak beranak actually okay lah pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak it's just like berak-berak macam constipation that's all hmm
bising ah anaqi he's crying ah
that's why dia cengeng ha kuatkan suara dia
but you cannot just take anyhow jamu you know because err some sekarang jamu tak tak ada macam banyak mixture
err drugs lain so it's already not in a pure form
dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap err jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak authentic so that's why it's dangerous ah
because it can affect your internal organs apa a
mak lah selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan lah then have to eat habis jamu pakai jamu pill pill okay ah mak punya time lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya tau
okay dah boleh start
belum is it nice
I saw like it's like metallic right macam kotak like that the design
tak lawa sia
betul lah
yeah aku nak tunggu price turun aja and then I can buy
aku dah lama tak pergi ah so macam tak ingat and I don't remember everything there
whoa so so berapa bilik
wah tinggi juga ya I thought usually I thought usually the bigger rooms will be lower
mm tapi like I think if you get city view you get sunset view
not really aku everyday aku sekarang kerja aja bangun bangun and then I just like relax for a bit and then I go go kerja
pasal ape ah
oh ini yang ada Jihyo right
itu banyak juga ah I mean it's it's normal amount of episode but if it's boring then just drop it man
eh you know the what you do for kau kau stay sana for like three days two nights kan
you let's say you booking pukul dua right
then korang buat ape
ah oh jalan jalan eh
dengan baggage semua
that one time I main layang-layang kat kat Sengkang right biasanya Sengkang ada open space before they made construction for hospital or something then like it was so windy that day I nearly hit a kid cause the kid was so close I was my mom was like okay kau eh kak you you you make the kite fly leh cause cause apparently I can fly kite quite well lah I don't know why that time maybe because very windy then the kid I turn one round the kid was so close to hitting the kite and I was like oh oh oh I like panic sia cause the mak pun sebelah dia je then I was like alamak kalau kena mati aku
me now me aku
orh berape mahal eh
yeah so total hour setengah
oh so so thirty minutes swimming thirty minutes mandi
then you kena keluar
is it then they still allow tak de lightning warning eh
is it is it now sekarang the the design is it like moon festival or what
yeah lah I mean like I had the membership a year membership because it was like twenty dollar something right I I keep going there until like I just go there for aircon only at that point because the aircon was quite cooling right dia punya aircon kan like sejuk gila nya then I was like okay let's go in relax tengok bunga okay then then I go home
wah during during pandemic was the worst lah that I have to be stuck at home boleh gila sih kat rumah dengan enam orang oof
apa you say what you say
like we wanted to go right we wanted to like plan a hotel staycay dengan kawan sekolah but then the pandemic happened and then every place just kena abandon sia
yeah man it's not even overseas people just staycay in Singapore pun susah tapi tak pe lah I think no one had money and somemore everyone like no job also
cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then I was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang err Nisha you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar I'm like yeah that makes more sense lah
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like as long s one day you get nine hours lah you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet I think at that one point Coffee Bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista lah
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside jer
mm yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then I can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like November ya October ah tak ingat
but then the results dah keluar eh like your whether you can get into the school
then sometimes kau pun macam malas lah nak cari lagi
yeah normal lah I mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like err what is the word ah oh main main blank like tak cerewet like that lah
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
there's so many videos about it now then I I mean I played before lah aku pernah main dengan kawan poly I was like I want play seh like like I just want to play
you need you need you need minimum lima orang eh
mm can ask our secondary school punya kawan
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl I I must say my volley friend lah there's this she at first I thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and I'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kena</malay>ok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics lah
then once someone kan dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang wah I found Nisha's body here here here then I'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then I'm like oh my god this this this girl this then I just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then I just keep maki her like wah this this girl ah she's lying so well ah and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer I'm like ugh it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then I'm like ugh I hate I hate her I hate playing with her
then got there's also another one where I'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well I was the intruder with her then after after err intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things lah so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu lah
yeah lah cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead I would mafia game kan macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan lah
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main UNO semua right it was it was quite fun lah honestly
I'm hungry man I like oh you're craving for meat ah but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
kenyal-kenyal ox man
I I won't be surprised right if you dah kawin then kau beranak kan then you like beef suddenly
are kau serius ke
funny lah usually pregnancy kan macam unknown unknown cravings
I thought I thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and I'm like that doesn't make sense
oh my god I want I want I recently was talking to Yin Shen about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang kan because since that last year want play layang already
then I was like oh can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan eh it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of September if we pergi Isnin
okay I think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama eh
no I'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
no lah I mean you can meet lah but if you wanna meet every week macam penat kan nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
I mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply lah
is it I mean I guess I mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan lah like I also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then I'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer what you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa kan
I hate it I aku tak aku tak suka eh paling benci aku when I hear that kind of phrase then I'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no wah I I had a debate with that with Chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
I'm like wah paling benci sia aku dengar apa that that phrase
I mean I don't I mean I I okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that I like I don't wanna really meet them anymore
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
eh kak aku tanya eh kalau naik bus kan straight okay let's say I want go to A to B then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to or what
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam eh if I take also around forty five fifty minutes kan it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
yeah but I feel like if if I was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain kan I don't know ah Singapore technology thing then I'm like okay I think I would cater more towards the disability
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit I don't want to pay extra money for this
hmm but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing kan
um especially nak naik nak naik ape transportation kan public transport
nak senang kan diorang nya apa diri
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga lah like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week ah there is a forest fire kat California or Oregon and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak eh it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's I think it's for few days then diorang kan kita nampak langit kan biru lawa their langit is red eh
yeah but imagine leh like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know I I like okay whatever people born to be lah that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever I'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
wah what if then they knew when they dia were they planning your name to be different
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name leh
over the top maksudnya apa
know yesterday aku kerja kan sorry I keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded lah cause Thursday gonna be Friday so I thought will be crowded can you guess how much I earned for I I work at F&B lah can you guess how much I earned for the whole shift
tak sampai tiga puluh aja
none I get seven dollar per hour right then I only make sales tiga puluh dollar aja or less than that twenty seven I think
yeah I thought okay lah at at first I thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five I had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded kan tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then I quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then I just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan eh then I'm like should I wash the air fryer now or should I wait cause sometime last minute also got Grab then aku tunggu aje lah tunggu kan in the meantime I just make like takeaway waffle
dah tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang eh I was like okay I just close up everything ah
kan like err don't know you should be happy or not like I'll be I mean for boss profit is addicting right this one is like I feel like I'm earning more than how much I how much I get profit from the ShopBack leh tiga puluh dollar eh it's like twenty seven eh I was like oh my god this is this this is easy money
I I guess so if you like if for the previous two days if kau macam busy gila macam selalu ada ramai orang then suddenly one day you just just quiet your body kind of just like zone out
eh then nyari Kelly kerja eh
but usually Friday ramai orang ah like it can hit incentive very very easily then I like I cannot I don't want do Friday cause I I hate I hate it that is only one person then I've to clean up everything
I save the earl grey cake sedap eh
aku ingat Andrew buat pasal dia selalu masak kan kat rumah kan buat baking semua

oof the thing that I want err you know sometimes I like to draw right then I like to support other artist punya art then the art itself cost like lima belas dollar aje then then their shipping tiga puluh dollar and I'm like oof tak payah lah aku simpan gambar dia online aja lah sakit hati eh nak beli dengan shipping macam tu
tiga puluh dollar dah already the cheapest then they gave me FedEx one lah then I'm like okay no no that one seventy plus already cannot afford this
oh sekarang tak de eh
that's why it's like that's a lot of money to like kacau orang on the website
I can boleh pakai untuk makanan ke baju ke for yourself kan then go around kacau orang only
kat mana online
dua belas okay what
is it the shipping yang mahal atau or what
oh then you got extra fund then you kau kau pakai lah
eh tell me the shop eh I also want to tengok-tengok
yeah what to do life kan kerja is kerja
kau nak countdown ke tak payah
tak apa I think for now kita kena err try our best to talk to fill in the one hour ahead
yes okay so apa yang sulaiman Twitter macam mana nak start
okay so basically sejak dulu I've always wanted to go to the kampung nak stay the night tapi sulaiman dah ajak so tak dapat tidur overnight cuma setakat gi mancing overnight then aku ni expert pergi sana without any proper clothing
and uh the the dah jadi mangsa to all these sandflies that's why right now you can see that I'm wearing all these sleeves to cover my aurat
err I went to the one that is nearer to to sulaiman's house juga lah it's it's just a
kalau jetty tu jauh jetty tu is really quite a distance this one is yang kat belakang kampung you'll be able to walk to this particular part of the beach then kat sana kita gi cast our rods lah
no that time was all the way to jelutong that one is all the way at the other end of the island yang ni betul-betul kat belakang kampung melayu
tak tahu orang melayu kan
okay you need a best part err banyak petuk tapi is just yang ikan yang aku tunjuk tu ah yang ikan tudung periuk
or in english we say the spotted sequel fish ya tapi ikan tu the story lagi best
aku dah mancing aku sengaja feel nak reel in tapi bila dah dapat eh tiba-tiba ganas betul-betul kau dapat rasa lawan bila kita dah angkat aku panggil sulaiman to come and check then all of a sudden kita tengok kat dalam dia punya mata kail kan betul-betul sangkut kat hidung
betul-betul on the nose
then the rest of the night tak ada ikan
kita jumpa dekat singapore so the the asal before kita jumpa sekeluarga
then dia datang naik grab bila dia claw grab ingat dia keluar gi bazaar ke apa
betul-betul keluar barang one by one ada claw back trolley besar satu bakul satu err bawa langsir
nak tukar langsir dekat dalam rumah dia then actually the next day more fun keluarga dia datang the next day dia nya extended relatives lah dia datang bawa tiga
connections lah kalau sebab kalau sulaimannya family yang dia punya extended family ni memang satu orang tu driver so kalau coincidentally dia dapat arrange with the driver senang lah tak payah bayar tambang free of charge
okay so kita dah sampai kampung sulaiman get everything ready six o'clock then salin baju semua
err that's what made me worried lah tengok dia dah pakai all full suit but I have nothing like am I supposed to prepare something on my end then terus
initially no intention tapi bila dah nampak sulaiman keluarkan joran tu the intention came out lah
six twenty five kita gerak then from there kita jalan all the way to that spot
we we actually walk all the way to this part of the dam ya actually macam where you get all the air keluar masuk then bila air pasang semua macam marina barrage lah and then you get on top of the stone then sulaiman cakap wan err ni part gerek tau bila high tide kita tak boleh keluar tau
kau kau nak tak abeh aku cakap go jer ah don't scared then betul-betul bila high tide eh terus sulaiman pointed at me wan tengok terus kita dah surrounded kiri kanan air pasang besar
then at first macam mula-mula tak boleh understand lah like the the depth of the air tapi bila air surut
once you see that low tide dia punya drop from the top of the dam to the bottom seram sia dua dua tingkat yes
so macam dari jauh tak nampak tapi betul-betul because of that that err concrete structure bila dah air tumpah bawah jatuh dalam seh
ya so basically macam this man-made structure is like very far away from the beach so there's this path yang kita kena jalan atas
then err ada from there is like a hill downwards lah so from there ada slope to err to bakau-bakau sini and after that we had to climb on certain bricks to get onto the structure so bila air pasang
the whole valley below semua ni semua covered so it's just us on this on this structure
so that time I think lucky lah sebab I think the tide was supposed to be three metres plus then the highest eh
betul-betul macam sini tau then dia cakap man kalau get any higher how aku cakap macam tu lah wan
takde there's no is open is basically your marina barrage bridge is basically the same logic as that thing
I think next time you go there confirm kau try juga high tide got stranded for like we were stranded for I think a good six hours six hours err because
air naik pasang baru pukul sepuluh but the coast too low then after that we were there until
pukul empat pukul empat dia dah naik sepuluh malam ya then after that pukul satu
tu apa was the highest then after that betul-betul tengok eh kita literally sia
macam tsunami betul-betul tengok bila air pasang air surut ombak dari luar masuk dalam
tak juga okay itu best okay this part censored sikit bila nak kencing kita ada satu spot
satu spot on the whole man-made structure kita technically I will consider this macam the north eastern part of it
away from the laut tapi towards the kampung
habis tu ada lah tengah rilek terus dengar ada kat belakang what what's that noise jangan pandang belakang oh
two three times because there's nothing much to do but sulaiman what he did most was he he makan some Pringles lah
okay so sulaiman dia dia tunjuk something this one is about naz yang recommend
dia ada satu backpack ni dia jadi tempat duduk
kirakan macam backpack punya the the sponge tu dia punya padding you can actually convert into a seat then after that sulaiman just duduk jer atas
but for my end ini tempat legend aku tak ada benda then um sulaiman punya mum cakap wan err kau tengok kau belakang ada ke tak
then I I I find this yang the simple basic students yang lipat yang buka tutup boat
so it was already like decomposing and then after that I just sat down and then kita testing dulu lah kat kampung tapi bila kita testing kan mesti nak kena fragile sikit tapi bila dah kat laut duduk sekejap aku ingat kayu yang raput tapi the whole boat collapsed
mana oh jelutong uh uh mm pulau ketam
dapat duit I don't know dapat joke the ikan
johan eh bukan ke
ikan johan ke I've heard ikan johan before dia macam ikan duri tapi besar
itu johan is like the middle leh it feels so weird
ikan duri apa tu jahat uh huh uh huh
I thought johan tu ikan keli besar pe oh
six duris so all the yang middle medium lah no jahans
that's why ah bento I wanna say jaring
net net lah jaring lah I'm just gonna say jaring or jala ah jala alright
ni pancing malam ke pagi overnight oh
ni COVID ke no
ah cause I thought the uncle was the one who bring you all the way right baiknya express
dah bayar lebih bawa lebih weh
mm mampus mampus
is it like the normal crabs or macam ketam-ketam bakar begitu
wah flower crabs yang kat pasar selalunya fuyoh the ones you get blue or brown
if blue if I'm not wrong is male tak ada telur ya brown usually is yang female lah
scary horror yes mampus okay carry on carry on
I wan two or wan three I wan three right mampus alright
orh pulau ubin juga okay okay
eh apa ni ah
tu lah mine mine I I wear arm sleeves you can't see but it's it's poking through lah poking through
but okay in terms of azan eh because this one also the same thing happened to me that time when I go with sulaiman but the the thing is uh not the spot but basically in the kampung melayu juga when we are back at home it was betul-betul subuh time lah
then when I was outside I thought like somebody was you know playing on the radio azan or quran
but then when I go outside I literally stand in the middle semua gelap I just stand in the middle and then I faced towards malaysia lah then I can really hear surau kat sana tengah playing eh tengah playing pula eh tengah tu lah tengah prepare tengah solat subuh
then for the first time macam the whole kampung betul-betul every subuh eh I think this one has to be like every day ah everyday in pulau ubin ada jer quran playing
so there's always quran throughout the whole island boleh dengar because kampung it's from malaysia lah you can hear from malaysia
so that means because because I think probably memang isolated then there's nothing to block except the trees then I can only suspect is the surau if I'm not mistaken is the masjid kampung pasir puteh
so white sands literally dekat malaysia ya then that masjid is when we look at the map
is quite close to by right the side so your area pulau ketam should hear it louder than kampung melayu
and ya lah so yang okay so yang pulau ketam is it the one that has this two storey building is that your spot
ya kenapa seh mana ada
tadi in the beginning I already say in the beginning in the beginning I already say a lot of malay so that's why right now I am trying my best to try to
campurkan melayu sikit with the english but when I try to put in the melayu I understand that I hesitate a bit jadi terkaku lah
habis bila dah focused then err then all the sentence everywhere
jadi kita try our best to not really mix everything lah cause that's that's against what they want us to do pe
ah yes ada kisahnya all
kalau dapat ke tak dapat bilang jer lah but instead you just keep the okay one of the things this one I can say lah because I think one month dah over pun
err I applied for this err safe distancing err ambassador at masjid omar salmah
so that one is the I think to me is the most saddest because it is the most yang kasi harapan because
when they called me I was at Sheng Siong and and then my they called the worst time cause I was supposed to pay but then they called me and then I answered the phone and my mum terpinga-pinga lah macam ni nak bayar ni
ya ya then for me I was err I just answer the call then cakap hi err assalamualaikum err err is this shazwan on the line
then I cakap ah yes may I know who is this dia cakap oh I am from masjid muhajirin mula-mula aku fikir aku apply masjid omar salmah asal why is it yang masjid muhajirin yang call
then I realise ah because err this thing is by right ada muhajirin but they need someone to err cover omar salmah so they called me everything then they asked to clarify certain parts of my resume
then aku explain to them lah yang okay aku ni dua puluh empat tahun
she ask the question tahu ke tak yang this place is very far very ulu ada transports sendiri ke tak then I said no but I've seen the map I can still walk there fifteen minutes lah
within the week so sekarang dah satu bulan
and there's still nothing so that's why I say this kind of thing eh like like at least bilang lah like don't keep the person waiting cause I was actually hopeful maybe
this is the rezeki I've been waiting for ya ke tak it's not it's not the one so that's why I'm like
err it's not it's tak baik lah tak baik
I think I think I think that one is the worst lah okay so to talk about sakit hati this one I don't know if if kita jaga aib ke tak jaga aib because it it it involves masjid juga
so so recently I I think for for for confidentiality I will not name the masjid
but I will say the proximity of the masjid the masjid is in the east so this masjid he surrounding dia has quite a few other masjids
yes so this is a part of singapore yang ada banyak masjid quite near each other ah if you knows what I'm talking about
ya but it's not the one that you probably think about is one of the masjid yang kat dalam-dalam sikit okay it's one it's definitely tak tak famous lah which is why lagi aku fed up
the whole story is yang mula-mula I got this call from this err person from I would say the communications department lah
kan so the communications department suddenly call me on monday afternoon saying um assalamualaikum shazwan err saya nik ni err
I understand from this person that you are helping us to design a poster so first of all in my mind siapa sia ni terus cakap since when am I helping to design a poster
for that time no because the way they say we have a deadline by wednesday is like err we are urgent lah urgent can you help us in my mind cakap
aku tak cakap benda I didn't I didn't want to be on board tapi the way you say macam kesian juga ini masjid
but the thing is that I don't like or don't agree on is that he just mentang-mentang kasi my
I did the poster so the poster was everything you know me lah my style is everything I do on Powerpoint then bila aku dah buat semua they they ask me
the first thing they asked is can you find the photos yourself of the of the asatizahs mentioned then aku fikir aku memang lah bukan orang alim
tapi who are these ustaz I don't know these ustaz what if I type the same ustaz and I put ustaz nama nama ustaz different person I wouldn't know also what
so that's why luckily I have this friend secondary school friend lah kita
aku minta tolong dia sebab dia pun by right macam orang masjid lah
and he he managed to provide me yang gambar-gambar betul lah so alhamdullilah so what I do is I just take the photos then I do the caricature lah basically it's just copy paste edit the shape
and make a cartoon version of the asatizah and the guest speaker so the guest speaker
yes so so that's why I say this masjidnya sebab apa
ada pula panggil fandi ahmad so I already did the design err I understand that the communications officer sebenarnya dia orang muda
so dia actually understand my style dia pun suka my style but of course kita akhirnya when it comes to all these things higher ups the final say then err
I think the the funniest argument is that one of the people on top say um aku rasa ada problem because I think later they are scared that because when it comes to this
so by right even for me lah when it comes to the hierarchy of such an event kita selalu moderator dulu you need a moderator to moderate then you have the speakers or your guests
so for me my logic is because of space constraint juga I put it in diagonal manner I put the moderator up here then the asatizahs together
and then I got fandi ahmad but the person who viewed this thing said err do you think it might be offensive to the asatizah that the moderator who is of lesser rank is higher
then in my mind aku fikir asatizah boleh fikir macam tu ke is that is that healthy for you to say eh aku lebih alim pe is that actually healthy sangat
but then he say but from left to right is the moderator is still first and then asatizah and then fandi ahmad would you think that the moderator because he is first in line he is of higher rank
that's why I say eh if I macam tu I I put circle pun you will find somewhere to start semua mesti salah punya right
we understand we know it's just that the higher ups refuse to listen ni yang susah orang tua tak nak dengar orang muda so the explanation is okay but I still feel ah that's it that's it so once that happens
err game lah so I I really at that time memang macam upset lah but the oh the final blow right is that yesterday
they they give it to the chairman chairman cakap okay okay go published Facebook Instagram published it was published I saw it
on Facebook and Instagram at eight dia pun bilang aku that timing and then after that the next day tiba-tiba the officer called me
that the pictures of asatizah are made into cartoons and then ya alah I fikir
but it's just is is is an effect I never made the nose bigger ke telinga besar ke is not I think but then the person that commented said it is offensive
to have the asatizah drawn as a cartoon then aku fikir balik ni macam kenapa nak terperinci sangat
ya so that's why in this situasi you can actually see
that orang tua is not very flexible they understand everything then
I really apologise for this thing um boleh tak
err kita delete all of your all of the drawings that you did and just put in the actual picture of the of the asatizah in my mind I was like
then the past three nights you asked me to make the last minute changes on the faces buat cantik-cantik bring it bigger make the font smaller
semua tu means nothing lah he say just delete everything just use the original photo can already
cakap we know of someone who can help us for free ah without consulting me or informing me at all
that is why bila aku dah tau dah find out who is the one responsible my Whatsapp was panas I literally texted
but only after I finished my poster I said err salam semua this is the poster that I have done
nanti tiba-tiba jer nama dah masuk dalam for benda-benda yang kita tak tahu pun apa nak kita nak buat
ah memang so so right now the thing is on that end the poster is still down is still taken down but
yang mereka masih persistent to make sure it's photos but I've already made it clear to the officer I'm sorry but I will not make any more changes because I feel disappointed I said it just just just blurt it out
and then the officer say I understand where you're coming from so I will still try my best to to err macam tukar err pemikiran orang-orang atas lah
cakap to understand that this doesn't this shouldn't offend people like how you think it will offend people because it's just
it's just a caricature tapi kita pun nak kena tengok logic tau the logic is the poster I did it because I I was informed of the age group
the age group was aimed for twelve to eighteen year olds kalau let's say you err
secondary school lah kau tengok gambar macam comic and gambar macam real mana satu yang kau macam more wah this one seems more interesting
so itu yang kelakar dia ni bahan lawak dia communication in the beginning pun tak kasi tau they never even inform me that I was supposed to do this thing
that's why I I I sound them all then betul-betul cakap I'm sorry I know I shouldn't have done this is it's unprofessional on my end I hope you may forgive me
then terpaksa lah kita forgive
tapi when they start saying oh by the way shazwan err can you just put the original picture ah that's it done I'm out thanks for nothing
because I mean to be fair juga lah if let's say you paid me and then I say this thing memang unprofessional of me because you already pay me but this part is that
you already say that I'm a volunteer know I mean I am forced ikhlas ke tak ikhlas so
that's the that's the sad part lah which is why it reminded me of the of the time yang dulu
kita ni kalau buat design ni freelance never do for free
mm itu lah
so that's why like when it comes to people always asking the designers to make changes macam for them is so easy that's why like
even for me there's always that moment cakap kalau senang senang kau buat lah sendiri what you mean so easy do yourself
itu lah that's why that's why even for me that's why I don't do freelance job because of this simple fact when you say I like it but can you no
then okay itu lah kadang-kadang kita fikir balik manusia ni semua menyakitkan hati
err even for you err folks over there that is listening in that is tuning into our err podcast terima kasih
kerana sudi mendengar kita err dah tak ada cerita cerita tu ada sebenarnya everything has been a true story believe it or not
ya lah tadi sebelum ni kita pergi bubble tea we we went to the bubble tea shop we went to we went to buy so just now like the initial story on the topic of
pelik lah but you know for the benefit of your program the thing that you are trying to do kita kita sudi tolong
sudikan masa kita pada malam sabtu ni untuk err tolong ah which is interesting because in english we say friday night tapi kalau like in in malay
err malam jumaat malam jumaat is thursday so the logic eh if you you if you're curious is that sebab kita
so maghrib is when we start our day so that's why for hari raya ah if you are also curious why we don't err fast
on the last day eh sorry why we don't pray on yang malam terakhir itu is because only hari raya
ya now dah start merepek tapi tu lah kalau kita asyik berbual for forty eight minutes straight kan these things will pop up I'm pretty sure we are not the only
err people the only participants yang err bual benda-benda merepek especially towards the the later part of this err
podcast err I wanted to say project which is the thing lah but for us we gonna treat it as podcast already lah kita betul-betul tak tahu nak bual apa lah kan

jadi bila I nak panggil you sayang
I picit loceng yang itu
no lah you not my waiter tapi
so you hari itu you cakap you nak you nak
uh harga quotation itu berapa so kalau within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack ke or
or total hack ke
so itu kita kena tanya
kita punya lah what will be the quotation
you cakap you nak nak nak hack certain areas
dekat the platform
whether it's whether kalau within kita punya budget ah
ya uh ya platform itu pun dah
so kena tanya lah kalau kita nak hack and then nak pasang a new
baru punya platform
ah berapa akan quote kita
platform memang platform memang mahal
ah so kena
kalau kalau tengok lah tengok budget kalau macam terover
maybe just hack and just letak vinyl
letak vinyl
tambah tambah platform
oh dekat uh
uh dia ambil dari mana
bagus juga lah you ada survey survey tengok-tengok jadi you ada idea lah
ah nak nak nak
nak buat uh renovation lah nanti
it anyway tingkap itu pun kita tak akan buka
kita akan tutup what sebab you selalu takut ada binatang selalu masuk ke apa
I think yang yang yang sliding door okay yang yang yang sliding
sebab kita pun bukannya nak nak nak buka kan kita akan tutup jer
ah dia dah dah haus benda pun dah lama kan
uh so ada juga ah ada ada banyak juga design
nanti I I I ambil gambar dan kita tengok bila kat daerah sini ada ada cantik juga
dia punya apa itu dia punya tingkap macam ah style condo condo style
very nice cantik
you can consider tapi tengok lah harga dia berapa
is what kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil
sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati ah dengan rumah kita macam
dia tak dia pandai tau dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab
kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak err
dengan err apa itu
dengan spray spray pencuci lantai semua
uh memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan
err letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi
time kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai
berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang is err isteri ya lah macam biasa lah isteri kalau
uh itu dia akan
ah ya lah faham-faham lah kalau
kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham lah nanti apa isteri akan buat kan
memang uh ya lah I understand lah your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
the kitchen the kitchen apa itu
who halfway uh merajuk and don't want to come
ya lah dia dia ini
you know like malas-malas to to come
so emotional then merajuk
ya macam I bilang you lah uh err kita kasi dia orang arrange
kita kasi arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah sebab kita
mungkin will markup
or work kita punya budget so kita kasi them
arrange yang yang rendah sikit lah
actually ya lah macam lampu ini semua kita dah
uh kita dia punya cost itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi ah
uh banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga lah kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga
so I mean sekarang ini yang the more yang lebih
tengok lah macam mana berapa dia orang akan quote
macam uh the the other time I I I
I tanya quotation ya lah macam toilet itu toilet itu kalau dua toilet
kurang-kurang pun at least satu toilet pun at least maybe three four K
dua toilet is around lapan K just toilet
itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk kitchen dapur bahagian sana lah sekaligus ah
tak yang yang bilik tak yang master bedroom vinyl kita almost thousand
thousand four thousand ah seribu lima seribu
apa yang bilik bilik master kita nak buka
agaknya lah
kalau nak ya lah kalau nak buat memang
memang I murah sikit lah tapi I think leceh ah
tak apa lah bayar lebih sikit biar the biar yang yang yang the experts
ya tapi bilik ini dia punya flooring
yes dia sejuk panas sejuk panas ha tengok ini dah merekah lah
that yang yang
dia merekah nanti jadi macam ah master bedroom ah sebelum sebelum itu kan macam masuk air semua kan nanti itu dah sebab sebelah
sebelah toilet itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah
sampai menggelembung eh
ini ini bukan ya ini bukan yang
I don't think this the ini vinyl yang
so so so tengok lah
kalau master bedroom we do it around berapa eh thousand
so kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin
oh mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya estimate nya
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate lah tapi that time kita pun kita punya budget pun tak banyak kan so kita buat yang yang urgent dulu lah
sejuk ah
kalau ada ada baby baru ke so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety dia tak keras sangat
kalau jatuh pun at least dia ada macam uh cushion this vinyl kan underneath dia ada cushion kan
then tak sejuk sangat
kitchen punya flooring
yang yang I I saw one of the picture you send
with the kitchen punya
but uh ya the one that we saw kak doro using I think wah

oo actually that's damn long eh I can't imagine like penat eh confirm
ah ada tempat duduk tak
before COVID oh my god it was a mess eh berapa banyak orang inside the bus
macam macam mana nak cakap eh like
susah nak breathe right yeah that's why I don't like wearing the mask you know it's really so hard
like satu tahun that is so long you know
yeah itu pasal ah nak buat apa right it's so sad seh like the amount of opportunities that we missed this year
kita tak tahu seh whether next year you can go or not
same oh my god last time I always go to makan sushi and the paling best right is like when malam malam kita go driving then we go and eat Ramly burger
but his burgers sedap gila oh my god actually like the authentic malaysian experience and I love it but like now
kasihan seh like
habis sekarang sebab COVID then they cannot do all these businesses you know like how they used to do and it's like so sad
huh tak best seh
dress up as a pocong to scare them
actually that's quite kelakar sia like honestly can you imagine malam malam tengah drive
habis tiba tiba nampak pocong scary wei I also will turn around seh LOL
yeah honestly but when in singapore tak ada apa apa jadi punya
like it's like okay kalau keluar terus kena ah arrested
habis like dia orang semua like they have fun with it ah but like I think I'm still grateful to be in singapore
no I don't need to go like all my lessons are all online and like seriously it's so fustrating I'm so penat
so it's like you always think that you have assignments due when actually you don't then like stress gila tahu honestly
it's like you would think that kalau belajar online lagi senang kan but no that's really not the truth it's really harder but the thing I'm grateful is like there isn't as many exams
but luckily for me tak it's like
our exam dulu kat um like hall besar besar kan sekarang it's all just in class
then honestly to me like tak ada vibes ah like there's no
and like honestly susah gila nak focus because like
ah tak my exam is all written
next sem we're going to have macam coding classes but this sem so far tak ada ah most of it is just like theory memorizing all so it's all on paper
eh but I thought they extended tak eh
best apa honestly I hated like
so it's always I feel like macam I'm the only person yang cannot focus at home but honestly I really can't you know but all my friends say like
oh it's so fun because no one disturb you or force you to do homework that kind of thing like it's very free and easy for them but like I tak rasa honestly
like for me like susah gila lah to focus at home like to juggle between like your life
ada satu tempat untuk belajar satu tempat untuk like stay home and relax you know then now is like very different
oh typical like mak melayu right honestly like they are all so naggy I think it's like
they are just born with it and I'm scared that bila kita jadi mak kita pun sama honestly I don't know
and I started using like photoshop of my laptop to like tulis notes and stuff
I did learn like a bit from this COVID nineteen situation bukan lah banyak sangat but
oh I only makan there like once before then I got try macam their chicken it's ironic cause I don't like chicken
but like their chicken is one the best but honestly I think a lot of people say that that's their best menu item right like the rendang
oh who did you makan ah malayan council with
oh man low key nak makan seh
like honestly but like you said mahal gila like I still remember the
memang normal lah cafes in singapore all the food mahal kan tapi like
yeah I always sesat at arab street honestly like
I can follow Google maps but I'm like honestly so bad at following directions so I always always sesat
more often so now I think I won't get sesat as much hopefully
I've been thinking of all these nice food to makan but guess what I can't makan cause I'm broke I can't find a job
same susah gila nak cari kerja serious like super fed up you know I'm like so fustrated
that kind of thing so like obviously semua orang apply apa kan
then bila apply then dia orang tak get back then macam tak faham seh like
I don't even know if I want to kerja at this kind of places cause honestly stress gila
like nanti ramai gila customers habis nanti got like fussy fussy people all but hopefully like
like dia orang macam sengaja right like they never like properly advertise their job scope
then only when you contact them then they will be like oh you have to do this nak kena buat itu lah nak kena buat ini lah
and I just don't understand like I've seen so many job postings like I also have that Telegram thing like apa satu
then like all ten never get back to me like serious tak faham seh
I don't know just make it easier for people to apply especially now macam COVID nineteen
time you think like senang meh cari kerja
yeah like honestly the tunggu like untuk tunggu like for them to get back to you that's like the worst part lah honestly
then like fikir fikir about it right it's like
you say a week right then any time in between that week pun you can call me you can like text me tell me I got the job
will end in a few months tapi tak
hais all this money that went to online shopping and now like yeah we can keluar but like barely pun
like I buy it for what I can't even like pakai to keluar and it's like so heart breaking
have this kind of spike and all then like when it terjadi macam terperanjat you know
we were like oh it's china's problem like kita semua ingat like oh china jer apa yang ada virus ni
like honestly I think in our heads we all thought that it would be like SARS because SARS was very contained in asia tapi tak seh
like tiba tiba ada berapa banyak cases
sekarang [dah] like how many one million two million kind of cases
like honestly banyak gila and if you look at the I'm so glad I don't live there because they are so like
and honestly like dia serious tak guna ah honestly he doesn't even do much for his country
and it's like now I see all these TikTok videos of like people who don't want to wear masks and like tak faham seh like
I understand wearing mask is susah lah but like you have to do it for the sake of your safety and other people also what right
yeah but if you think about it macam kasihan seh orang orang kat because like in the end
if you think about it all these old people who like they don't know much about the virus cause it's something like baru to them right
then maybe they will just dengar what he say because in the end he's president what he is the person who does everything and has the right of way
so it's like so kasihan
yeah exactly something that the president don't have and it's like so merepek sia you think about it it's like
it's like now I'm kind of having holidays because my exam only like on thursday lepas tu habis kan
ah kejap eh
so he like macam like got my attention ah then like wah he not bad sia honestly
but tak apa ah maybe this kind guy will be the exception kan
tuk tuk and like nenek will have these kind of names
super super tinggi but like one seven five not bad right
like okay lah I'm not like super upset about it ah tapi um macam sakit hati ah like because like
he just double tick me sedih tahu
I only made the account semalam so it's like what
banyak gila like malay guys who like match with me
daughters as in macam anak anak perempuan
it's like very personalized so macam you tahu macam he don't use it on other girls
I don't know the guy so far okay lah I think everyone macam
extra bosan now cause of like COVID nineteen
intense apa
like tak pernah dengar seh a dating app like this like OkCupid is so chill what it's like
habis lepas tu start talking but like Bumble is so intense what the heck
you got try before right the K Fry chicken sedap tak
ah seh honestly kita selalu pergi malaysia because like the prices are cheaper right especially with the
it's sedap gila like I don't even like dim sum
yeah like dulu kita kan selalu pergi malaysia like my family will go to like
makan like we are always eating you know
like you said there's not much to do in so it's always like makan makan makan
like kita
in one day I think we will makan at like what three different restaurants and three different places
like konon konon macam food tester ah try out like all the food in malaysia and
but like honestly like best gila seh that experience it's like
like you say everything that is not halal in singapore is halal in like malaysia
so it makes my life so much easier like you know every time I go like kena makan pepper lunch
I think it's like I saw your story then you saw my story kita dua kat kan then you like ask me where I going then like you said oh I going there also then I remember it was so funny
habis like tengok bawah
eh is that anna habis my whole family macam
siapa ah dia boleh like terserempak in cause we are singaporeans right
best apa imagine being able to go to an Apple store and like just woo spend all your money on the stuff honestly good life
I rindu seh like I used to love going weddings you know why
cause I want to makan nasi biryani
but yeah basically macam
so our weddings we'll make sure that we eat nasi biryani then we will make sure that it's the most
authentic nasi biryani cause you know sometimes people try to like put a twist on nasi briyani and all tapi tak
our weddings will always have like the nicest nasi biryani and honestly I just miss all that
he always does macam poll on Instagram and then got one time he tanya which is a must have for your wedding
then people didn't vote nasi biryani I was so sad you know I felt like it was a betrayer because
every wedding has to have nasi briyani like
when I think of wedding I think of nasi biryani right
yeah and another thing that I feel like kena ada is sambal goreng pengantin right
mm macam macam pelik also pe like hari raya is a holiday by itself you should enjoy it totally pe like why would you want your wedding in the middle
you know apparently got some people who purposely do their wedding during puasa so tak payah makan
but like how pelik is that like puasa is like meant for
puasa you know macam
mana orang nak pergi wedding mana orang nak pergi celebrate semua macam merepek kan honestly
exactly it's just weird honestly now thinking about it sekarang COVID
err wedding kena ada apa apa dua puluh orang jer kan
you know like honestly you know how malay families macam selalu kena ada wedding besar besar kan honestly I wouldn't mind
like I've always been telling myself I don't want a wedding yang besar besar because
okay you think about it you eh you're the pengantin right then like penat gila seh you must tukar outfit berapa banyak kali throughout the day
habis you kena salam salam semua orang kena senyum the whole day I don't want
macam my wedding to be full people yang my mum tahu you know cause it's my wedding pe shouldn't it be people yang I tahu not my mum
yeah I think yang paling penting is like the wedding it's like you do for yourself
yeah you did for yourself but then everyone remembers you as like the bride yang cantik yang berseri you know that kind of thing yeah honestly
yeah it's like a half half thing lah need to see whether my husband in the future kaya tak kidding
you know macam like err ada movie this one movie I forgot what the title is ah tapi macam
dia orang best friends dari kecil then they came up with their own book on how they want their wedding to look
habis like they in the end they ended up fighting then they weren't friends anymore
like honestly I forgot the name of the movie ah tapi the movie best gila
since dulu I've always wanted to do like a
I don't think being special is important but I think like just being unique not normal macam lagi best ah to me
I haven't thought of children's names yet but I'm pretty sure like that phase will happen soon cause I'm like so bosan now
yeah like in singapore macam susah gila nak like get all these things ah honestly cause
susah eh nak dapat all of it yeah so it's like
yeah I also think about it like err my dream die do right is to belajar in Australia
but actually like if you fikir about it lah actually it's better if you get into a like local uni because technically they are better
but I just feel like the experiences you gain bila like you go overseas and all is just very different you know
then like I don't know I also pun nak migrate but then if you think macam sayang right cause everyone is here then nanti raya macam mana raya will be
but I can't imagine now like sekarang jer [dah] susah for me to speak malay then imagine like when I have a child in the future
like you know dulu all my family members call me celup because they say like I always speak english even though I should be speaking malay that kind of thing
then when I got into higher malay in secondary school semua orang terperanjat macam huh
how did you even get into higher malay when you malay like berterabur
yeah actually it's true ah macam
we're not so good at malay right but we're not that kind yang want to totally forget about our language
like dulu like in malay class my cikgu always say like you want melayu to become obsolete is it
how all of you tak tahu cakap melayu semua then like I think about it like true seh like
how can a language just disappear macam sedih kan like you grew up with it and then like suddenly one day you see nobody speaking malay
so I will try my best to improve my malay sekarang I don't know
yeah honestly faham ah like hari raya is very like
honestly I feel like good looks is macam
genetic ah like kalau your parents
you macam
I rasa macam
good looks bukan benda yang you boleh work for but fit body is
dia tak boleh dapat any other way
I pun nak tanya
cause err I went I went to some I went to gardens by the bay kalau tak salah
because macam
I baru baru-baru ni I main apa tu
I I main kan then I noticed ah
you know then it's like especially now because everything is so macam
senang nak pergi nak nak fly back dari like singapore to like and all that stuff very interconnected so
I rasa macam
kalau kita orang err
kalau manusia were to be extinct right
then I rasa
most likely way would be dari viruses macam COVID lah that kind cause we are so
you never ever really hear about them pasal
tak ada banyak orang yang pergi africa
if we tapi kalau
going to africa to like visit ke apa
you might find like a lot more of these diseases more common in other places tapi like if you also see right
africa pun dia orang punya COVID cases not very high
so kita orang tak
tak prepared lah kira
I faham I faham
tu tu okay tu kalau
kalau population turun kan
the world gets better in a sense pasal
the the one problem that we're facing now is terlalu banyak orang tapi tak cukup err tak cukup resources macam you you said economics right that's the first thing that we learn too many wants not enough
so in a way unless like if yes our kita orang punya population turun
pasal like stuff like hunger and all that stuff
it will go down but it won't go extinct pasal there will come a point where
dah cukup like now we finally have enough
kalau you boleh err
kalau you boleh dapat tiga skill
yang err apa-apa skill lah you nak
apa skill yang mungkin you pilih
apa-apa lah
so kira like you you can you play soccer so kira maybe like you can dribble very well you can pass very well that kind
or if you want to like make it specific soccer to simplify also boleh lah
you punya
apa third one tadi
okay lah I feel like that yang yang the last one is
you you tak boleh manage stress you are done
in in my in my opinion lah like macam
because I run like competitively so I rasa macam ada orang yang
yang yang yang very
nak nak pergi dia orang suka competition macam gini and all that stuff
untuk I kan suka competition but at the same time I cannot help but feel nervous before competition like I like there are people who love the competition and they just it it comes naturally to them like performing well at competition they like that competitive part lah
if I have one skill it will to be to just enjoy enjoy that competition take that stress yes but understand that you dah kerja dah dah dah dah train dah work very hard for it
I feel like you can translate the endurance into almost anything and everything that you do because what comes with the endurance is not only macam
bukan physical jer tapi
also dari segi mental
boleh tolong ah pasal
I rasa kan
so kalau kira I tengah buat
err example lah during err exam during exam period kira kita orang stressed dari like buat maths mathematics ke apa
kita orang boleh pergi main bola ke boleh pergi lari and all that stuff ni benda yang I rasa orang lain tak faham ah
macam dia orang kira oh
main sports like during that exam period is like wasting time and all that but dia orang tak faham yang like for people like us people yang selalu buat sports and all that
cause macam you do math then you are like wah
wah tak boleh ah tak boleh I cannot solve this question then you very stress
then you will like wah then you even more stress you you feel even more like lebih teruk
jadi like
I macam
I can okay there are times when I can read situation betul betul tapi
and like most sometimes it can be bad lah like with around my friends is okay you know because they know how I am and all that tapi kalau let's say in a setting with like older people or all that stuff
you know so kira you you I'm not the kind that will mince my words when I see something wrong
so I rasa like that's one thing that I can work on lah and that's something that I should work on
apakah sesuatu yang you
you nak
apa yang you nak yang you wish that would be free
that will be free of like free I mean not just free of charge dari segi wang tapi juga macam you don't have to work for it
like it just comes macam gitu
okay lah then we keep it to benda physical lah like macam yang benda monetary ah monetary
free untuk
because in my opinion macam
and macam you will feel very purposeless
like macam sekarang
kawan-kawan kita orang semua macam bosan tak tahu yang tak kerja lah tak kerja tak like training macam kita orang
dia orang macam bosan tak tahu apa nak buat then like I have had
ada lah orang yang bilang saya macam dia orang feel very purposeless tak tahu apa nak buat pasal sekarang dah habis exam kan abeh dia orang
tak payah belajar and all that stuff
okay lah you can make money from it also but in a larger extent you can also help to eliminate problems macam world hunger and all that stuff you know
it will help not only myself but it would help orang lain
satu hari macam in the future that will be that will be not a superpower but that would be something that well have like like you get what I mean like in the future you will probably be there will probably be like a machine or like just something small that you just press and you can just go to wherever you want
ya just because he's dia dia masih dia masih manusia macam kita orang
dia the the relentlessness the drive that he has
is what makes him macam different
macam he will not stop until
that he that dia dia
dia deems as
um not good lah so basically whatever he does is really untuk kebaikan orang lain that kind and he will like do anything for his family
the the the common pasal I baca comics kan the common like theme throughout semua yang semua
dia very rarely dia make mistakes
because dia selalu fikirkan betul-betul
buat ah kerja dia betul-betul make sure make sure that like he gets it right
but there are times when dia pun
apa tu dia pun makes mistake lah because he's human what so
oh carrying on with that because you know how batman selalu macam
kadang-kadang in like comic kalau you baca
so going off on those labels that like you you can think of for batman right what are some labels that you rasa
can be good can be bad you you just say lah apa-apa lah
a label tapi macam
it is an idea yang macam
kira okay so
that that label that oh he's a he's a very good runner therefore he can do he can run like apa-apa jer you know
I don't know lah I I do like you I macam plays a lot of
because you got all these outside influence kira then you
you know you get what I mean kira
I mean you said that sometimes it can be bad that's true it can especially when you are kira unfit for your standard and all that then people mentioned like eh how come you today like a bit slow eh how come like you look like you put on a bit of weight
kira it can be good lah
given your current life kan like kerja cause kita orang baru habis err exam
tapi like if let's say like five six years from now
lepas lepas lepas uni bila dah start kerja ah
to be fair I also macam I I feel the same way as you
your dream job you want to be physiotherapist and you say kalau
people you nak kasih dia orang apa yang you tak you tak ada
I I pun nak macam gitu tapi I rasa macam the one job that I would enjoy the most would probably be training
so like being a coach cause sekarang like I I already sort of do that lah kadang-kadang like macam
I go back to school then like I help some of my I tolong coach I
to like err ajar budak-budak yang baru masuk macam gitu lah
then I rasa macam
it will probably be pagi
they especially kalau lari kan so like morning will probably be an easy run
tengah hari probably another coaching session but in between probably lunch break or something can slot in like a gym session then after that like the coaching session this coaching session probably like just coach a bit
and then not much running probably macam benda technical and all that stuff which I can also do lah in that sense which would be better because in a sense kalau you are doing the drill or you are you are training with the rest of the team or like with your with your trainees
that would be and then that is like probably in afternoon then at night probably another training session in and stuff like that lah this is of course like you said assuming yang tak ada orang lain dalam apa tu dalam err my life lah that kind
I don't know I rasa macam I punya ideal life is very training centric
by the way foodpanda helmet masih ada tak
ingatkan nak pergi ambil besok ramai orang masa tu uh queue untuk ambil helmet
takpe lah by the way ada kerja kosong tak
okay nanti bila hari isnin ke apa bilang ayah lah
macam abang azri pun boleh if not depends ah uh similar to my intern kot
oh by the way then our family this month ada apa-apa plan tak

oh habis tadi siang tak cerita dengan ibu
series main macam filem
kenapa suami nicole yang jadi suspect
serious kecohnya bodoh apa
habis kalau gitu netflix ada tak
lol leceh habis besok keluar dalam tak
tak habis-habis sia habis kalau gitu tadi balik tak nampak pun motor scrambler mana motor scrambler tu
dia hantar sevice apa
habis kenapa tak suruh full service jer
uh untuk motor tu
ha gitu jer lah dia tapi tu motor untuk abang ayie eh
ah biar lah asal dia orang dua bahagia lah
a'ah uh engineering informatics yes betul
dia punya is more on
uh engineer punya side more on not say maintenance dia punya more on testings
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one uh ya yang test setakat masuk setakat duduk from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad lah the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like abang azhar on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well ah he he works at dia kerja kat jurong uh water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level uh when it rises when it lowers err which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview uh every uh mostly entire of singapore like know the longkang and stuff like that
okay lah not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause dia masih dia orang sponsor dia orang sponsor dia sambung belajar
a'ah dia tengah ambil part time diploma
ya dia tengah ambil kat uh singapore poly because near to his workplace ya bayar sampai bayar sampai habis uh second year ke atau I forget I never got
but tengok lah macam mana
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know uh you know they ride by they saman people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle ah like one my friend she intan at uh hers is under
dia bantai jer gaji dia besar
I mean kalau pun not bad uh dia sampai what two let's say you habis two forty five you extend what pukul lima pukul enam then after that
ya I think so oh ya ya yang tadi kita berbual-bual
ya ke ingat oh
five to seven lima ke lima tujuh ribu depends
huh murahnya
tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang uh
huh sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang clutch housing kadang-kadang bearing kat dalam engine kadang-kadang piston banyak benda yang akan effect your bike
ya lah me lah I mean ha kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya ya tapi the reason I want to use is ayie's not say lumba your bike considered
untuk budak-budak err bawa motor nakal tapi you bawak terus jadi motor apek
okay lah kalau gitu how about kita share
apa X one apa uh oh oh class two A ke class two B oh two hundred oh
tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat carpark
okay lah cuma at the same time nak kata nak kata sayang tapi
tak boring ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh
kesedapan at the same time untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa motor boleh jam boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu
got a bit lepak ah in a way so he thought want to earn more money
no he he he was dead serious dia betul-betul uh dig through everything asking me macam
uh all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab apa dia punya benefit apa dia punya you know uh
apa uh akan jadi kalau gini gini semua so I ceritakan dia lah I was uh apa tu
I bilang dia macam
okay kalau foodpanda leceh dia kita kena book shift kalau deliveroo dengan grab uh anytime kita boleh start boleh offline
uh antara ni tiga company tak semestinya uh masing-masing ada uh dia punya
benefit dia tapi at the same time ya lah he tak boleh cerewet lah kita kena banyak sabar because
I pernah tunggu one hour for just one makanan so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
dia macam dia macam okay jer macam
boleh jer tapi at the same time tak tahu lah pasal motor tu kan pun under ayah
pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula so okay lah pros and cons ah siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi understand lah maybe back then his workload was too much in a way lah pasal dia kata uh
ada budak baru masuk this and that so macam workload dia macam kurang tapi macam spread uh evenly ah so untuk dia
uh advantage ah pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya shift lagi dia ada pagi atau petang so that time dia pernah tanya lah macam
uh dia ada bilang dia punya uh cadangan dia kalau dia buat
kalau dia kena pagi punya shift lepas habis pagi dia dia uh ha dia buat delivery dia dia kayuh daripada
uh lepas maghrib ah sampai malam
tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak lah dah cakap dah uh dia cakap senang ah pakai bag kau abang tak payah beli so you know lah your brother macam mana eh
huh ya lah dia dia berbual kat orang jer ah cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak lah
ya tapi tak tahu lah I mean dia sendiri that time nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli padahal dulu dia ada yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak problem this and that so I don't get his point ah
pasal tak tahu lah dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar oh ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka you know tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham ah dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia
dia tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik motor bagi kat ayah so dia beli motor sendiri after dah berapa tahun ya dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu lah dia
uh huh dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul
tak pasti ah tu kena tanya ayah mmhmm mungkin kot
then oh then that time apa abang ada tanya
uh he he dia tanya akak kerja grabfood macam mana mmhmm then I said lah macam gitu lah dia I uh I say lah the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then dia terus bingit ah dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang lah kau panas baran macam gini macam mana
tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki how
tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena viral jer
ya ada yang that time punggol budak-budak grab gaduh dengan vendor pasal tak tahu sabar I think it was some promotion lah then I think
ya jangan jadi viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
oh oh ya my friend my friend kerja roo uh this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot lah even though
I mean kita dah layan hujan habis
bayar sikit jer you know so for roo to do that I'm very amazed lah
oh tak distance dia memang dia dia add on tapi ni dia tambah lagi because dia orang perasan somehow I think orang complain pasal hujan then you know safety and stuff so at least
worth it and you know macam berbaloi ah
ya for roo macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas so if compared to grab I have to take three orders tapi three orders pun tak semestinya I can get within less than one hour
ya waktu
macam tak masuk akal no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works err when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this ah because it's considered their rice work ah
kau tahu macam mana nak buat brownies

ha nampak
topic ni berat eh topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
uh look wise tapi beauty in uh nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
uh time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini lah eh kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
oh that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus err bagus bagus
I don't see myself as kau tahu kan macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak lah memang not even near that lah but because I I have my insecurities um based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic eh kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what I mean
memang tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're we're not gonna touch on that but we can just uh it's between the both of us what is our definition
oh okay for me my kawan the friends that I go like the friends that I cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak I I don't see like oh kau lawa I'm gonna be friends with you no no no no I never sebab
kau lawa I was going to say you no no no no I never sebab
I mean I don't know for me memang I don't see
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people uh there there is some uh cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that that that popularity I'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you eh macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa eh we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and err err our friends yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward tau and that that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever inshaallah
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what I mean like like betray or
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
like fashion wise you know is it oh damn okay I think I get what you mean my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
uh handsome uh lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also um
uh girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard lah dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
I don't know err macam for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then uh take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends lah how you are brought up you know
not just that lah beauty in terms of you know right uh now we are all going to that stage of working kan it's always kalau it's always macam you see this um
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
I mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur eh I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi uh beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that uh
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari um
is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam E-boy E-boy
uh no err not not not the first uh judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but uh overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun uh is an interesting fact
true true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is is nothing macam okay lah first judgement yes appearance tapi kan people say kindness is beautiful to me intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
uh macam the the act of uh sharing macam
uh caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam I think beauty eh is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang eh they say macam asalkan kau kemas kan macam kau err you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you I'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no I think I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty eh is again macam very it can be very um
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know uh I I got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of uh people
uh again it's it's about um macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada I I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me I find that
macam kau do do you have any like um
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of uh topic
I pun sama
sama sama sama sama for me sama err like I think
susah eh macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik lah kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam eh alamak you know what I mean
I I came across this one uh uh apa tu uh it's a meme lah the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying uh dia like macam to god tau god uh
okay but I think betul lah macam
for me pun times yang I I I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful lah you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means eh
if I'm uh pretty I will get somewhere I would get uh at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least I have something tapi
tapi okay siapa tak nak lawa kan siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
um tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
I think kan for me okay kita kita perempuan kan but I I think um generally generally speaking kan I think it's the girls is it but not me lah
subjective subjective but but I think kan it's more towards the girls sebab kan kau tahu lah macam we have like boys and girls is different what kita punya how we hangout how we
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
to you apa to you which one for you
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also lah you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about eh look at that I mean eh macam eh have you heard this about I heard about macam some of my friends uh classmate dia macam eh kau tengok tu eh kau tengok dia ni eh kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
kaum wanita lah it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but uh uh um to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
uh okay uh kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this uh or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada jer yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni I you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with um you can say ni lumrah manusia tau you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this tau it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally uh got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having uh insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay I'm not gonna I'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning what that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini kan it it can be because maybe sebab uh you are having this disabilities which I I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they they never do anything to you what betul what macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your uh clothing ke based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can uh about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
is is tak berapa bagus
not just beauty tau macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen uh kau tahu kan macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak kan macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast kan you know what I mean
that macam uh the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that uh after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit macam betul lah like
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work what because
true true true so memang ini
lumrah lah eh memang memang it's the world lah it's just it evolve like this lah to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be uh plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay uh dunia hiburan
about okay uh western world atau K pop eh macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa jer pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
eh actually no actually no I think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the K pop world you know what I mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty what we we we judge based on uh music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
uh there are uh idols macam mana eh
macam okay uh like
tak I think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also K pop sebab K pop I I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of uh like of kau pernah kau pernah uh come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa tau macam
to me it's fine lah but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
so I think that is also rabak lah to be honest
ah memilih kasih padahal sama group tau padahal they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead lah like like why sanjung uh idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada jer yang news turns out that oh this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't uh
yes you said it betul apa
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
beauty eh macam
uh sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards uh bad punya
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as uh the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat kan it's not uh it's not it's not a good habit for them what sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
tengok jer macam um oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that uh hosting punya and she can be successful you know what I mean
yang benda uh success
it also goes with macam top uh fashion wise you know what I mean
macam kau tahu kan dulu uh okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like uh sloppy
macam T-shirt and cause that's what I I do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai uh kopitiam or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like eh dia ni biar betul you know what I mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita I'm gonna feel macam
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
a dress with heels to a kopitiam people will look at you macam eh you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
uh think macam oh kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this uh the the era macam how uh move eh you know what I mean
lain eh which is weird eh macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir wah
as technology becomes more macam
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
jap eh
tak tahu no no no no no I'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step jer macam they just follow the trend you know what I mean
I think there is like macam photos trend I guess kita kita use simpler uh simpler terms eh
as you know macam around starting to see because here I feel it
you know what I mean sekarang uh is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is uh macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
uh this kind of thing uh macam pinterest uh
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok kan
sekarang tiktok where
the you you I mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist uh kim K ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
you know what I mean so maknanya
due to that that's why uh people are like following macam okay macam E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me I think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing err you know what I mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see oh I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself lah macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak uh your maybe your cliques are all macam
uh going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you if you uh if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good uh circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap eh this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends uh macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't uh people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
with people macam mana eh I I say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
so macam you know like um you know they say there's a saying macam uh everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana eh like
err macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what I mean macam level of for the good
tak bagus lah tapi macam like see this is how uh trend setting macam
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then uh then you should
you should have your own pride eh macam you know what I mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot jer shoot
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them oh
where you stand macam mana you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what I mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good uh there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
I mean you know some people macam for me no eh macam for me I got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I I mean you know there are some people
kita nampak I've I've I've seen this
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group kan dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus lah I I rather be alone you know what I mean I I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own uh pendirian daripada
I I think uh I need to find I need to find a friend because uh because people might think nanti macam I got problem
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong uh he he or she is of a good uh direction even if the person is alone go ahead I I kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on oh kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish lah I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me eh aku aku I like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana eh
you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know I just say but if I were to
tapi what I I can advice macam
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
macam you you know kita aku case macam the clown eh macam the class clown and then and then when I okay okay for the kita ni ni macam podcast eh tapi macam okay for those who tak tahu
aku I'm I'm okay I won't say that I'm I'm ambivert macam I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met mahirah kan macam okay dia macam pendiam tau but actually she's not you have to get to know her to know her
tapi uh mahirah aku
ya it take a long time not years lah tapi but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a it's a connection
but no aku respect kau sebab okay you you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful kau
for those who tak tahu
kau chairperson seh kau your leadership skill is really aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik err sebab your leadership is the best
and those who don't know don't know tapi once you find good people right you you stick to them macam for me thank you for being
my friends chey macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab sebab it's true it's true
ya around sec two is where we kita more like kita dah kenal sec one but sec two is the year where
kita macam eh dia ni dah gila dia ni dah gila
kita punya gila-gila dah start kita punya gila-gila kita punya hantu hantu setan dah start eh dah start eh ya that's that's tapi wow those are the great days no those were the days where kita don't give a shit about appearance wise you know what I mean
kita kalau like eh how beauty what ever no kita macam kalau kau baik kau
kawan macam kau boleh gang dengan kita go ahead like come advice kita takde macam
seek uh clique clique mana ada kita open seh open macam ni
whoever nak join join asalkan kau uh you have that
you I mean uh sometimes you are good you know I mean kau kau orang baik tak payah macam pandai ke apa tak payah tak we don't we don't we don't do that
no kita tak kita tak
ya and now that we are matured right kita punya topic pun makin mature eh
friend pun kita dah macam we we we talk about mature stuff now and also confirm kita ada joke around but
we we kita takde mahu kita we we don't like really like judge people I think
tapi that's that's the that's the good thing about our
yes aku aku respect beauty those people who I find really pretty right aku macam aku macam respects seh like you know what I mean like like macam celebrities I would like wah
like wow you know what I mean macam uh models yang macam handsome pun aku macam wow you know like
aku aku take that as a role model you know like wow that that is
macam wow lah you know what I mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
dia punya beauty kan
and her personality oh my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice kan lemah lembut kan and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa tau
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what I mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what I mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect sia aku aku aku tabik
wah that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it wah
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku siapa eh
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how lah but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like eh rambut kau lawa tak tak eh no no uh when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam alamak come on lah you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what I mean it's it's how you are brought up juga lah how does everyone
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang macam motherly kind of uh you know what I mean of how she brings me out aku
of a role model like wow like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what I mean
we wanna be someone like that that's that's what I see macam
and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
macam ajar then wah
um tak payah cakap pasal beauty lah it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what I mean
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
uh pelakon ke apa kan then I would say neelofa
is the ya malaysian punya actress host uh business woman sebab kan uh kalau kau tak tahu kan dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi uh
milan uh to the the business berkembang
she is a great uh host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of uh being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like wah macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
uh role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and uh of a islam uh muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
betul betul betul the I mean the the the life the hereafter lah
ya tu oh my god singapore living ya
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is wow I think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model lah I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome uh bekerjaya and um uh apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then um of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh uh rumuskan eh sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi um what I can say is that we shouldn't just um we shouldn't just
uh okay what's that word eh I want to say that this kau tahu kan macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what I mean we we don't we don't err okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down what like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what I mean like
betul you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of uh just be humble be kind I think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly I think I think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
so then you just be humble lah macam
you know what I mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty lah because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I I think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause I felt like
to have like prioritise in me sebab I I tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang seh
you know what I mean so it has I should be more macam have that confidence which I I aku tu tu last time eh tu last but right now I have I work on that and it's it's I find that
so to the next ya uh future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside eh tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian I know where
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what I mean so I aku macam to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab I got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job uh macam uh cleaning wise ke apa kan
kau why would you uh I've seen this this is another topic err like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern eh I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because uh kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like uh kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just uh okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists I I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like oh my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri kan this is what happen when kita lupa diri so I I I just want to advice myself that oh my god please
nadia don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau I get that extra money ke I get that extra title ke I might forget about myself and people below me
because I myself experienced it how bad it is and I know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future I advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this uh blessing will be taken away from you you know what I mean that's uh
alright one okay one two three kita press eh

next year kalau boleh I nak gi lah tapi
because sekarang
kan australia punya borders err rasa rasanya dalam Berita Harian  dah tertulis
they tutup sampai
tahun twenty twenty one
oh betul ke and you tak pernah visit
you should you should so then macam mana dengan
person that suka holiday suka keluar err
for new adventure tengok new adventure see new things so during
err tahun ni kan semasa lockdown uh semasa COVID you ada rasa macam you
you suffocating a bit ke tak like you know um like you cannot go on holiday you ada rasa macam mana
during circuit breaker at that time I was renting my room dengan ni house mates I
and at that time there was like five of us in the house so tak rasa macam lonely sangat lah
because sebelum ni kan
you memang tahu I tak tahu
memasak langsung so I didn't know how to cook um nasi pun tak tahu lor so then it's like
susah sikit lah
then I had to macam ask
I was very lucky that during the lockdown I tinggal dengan mereka lah at that time ah
boleh boleh makan lah but then there was this one time bila I masak uh kari ikan
salmon salmon I okay boleh makan tapi curry dia I think sebab I added too much water
so rasa dia macam air instead of or is rasa dia macam salmon soup instead of salmon curry lah
hais you tahu tak hari tu because I'm thinking to myself
that you ni kan memang drive and I take public transportation
so I was thinking hari tu kan you know outside rumah I ni I was sleeping very soundly by myself and you know just
dia accident
betapa kuatnya I heard bang
and I was like apa jadi ah
look out the window but then tak nampak apa apa then kawan I ternampak
memang yang accident tu teruk lah dengan motosikal
then kereta depan dia memang hempas sampai the whole thing is spoilt lah
kemek already crash already lah
ya so then after that few minutes later you can terdengar lah ambulance tu
ah betul
mm betul tapi you pernah kena accident tak
so far pernah
okay pas tu
wah kereta dia terbakar
I rasa macam I ada nampak
video tu kan I think ya no bukan nampak kereta dia kat tampines tapi I think I rasa I nampak video dia kat TikTok
sebab biasanya usually kalau ada accident kat singapore ke apa apa yang terjadi dia akan upload dalam TikTok
so macam tu lah so talking about the news um do you follow tak the the punya politician semua
mm I nampak tapi I macam tak faham
faham lah
sepatutnya I nak pergi shopping tapi I rasa macam hais
you know kena save money lah
and then you know uh tapi I rasa macam the houses here pun sekarang
getting more expensive and kalau tak I kena you know buy like somewhere further away from the city and it's not convenient sebab I tak pandu kereta kan
so macam tu lah eh you ada siblings ke tak
oh I tak tahu pun you ada siblings
okay so your big brother buat apa
tak ada lah I ni kan only child
so that's why that's why like you know my parents I kena take care of them lah
so that's why during this COVID nineteen time I worried sikit lah sebab kan they are walking around in singapore
I takut lah kalau ada apa apa yang jadi especially bila that time when the domestic workers the numbers were increasing and
you tahu lah parents ni tua-tua yang semua tua-tua ni kan
bila kita bagi tahu jangan keluar dari rumah sebab sekarang ni kan COVID dangerous especially if you are high risk
risiko tinggi kan jangan lah keluar sebab
macam diabetes high cholesterol
err like macam mak I she's had a stroke before it's it's dangerous lah to to bahaya lah to go out
things in public kan and taking the public transport and dia ambil juga
so that's why memang tak nak dengar lah so susah sikit lah so like I was very worried for my parents but then it looks like
the numbers here in singapore is dwindling is is sudah semakin kurang
so nampaknya macam okay we're getting better
but then you tahu tak what is the difference between phase three dengan phase two sebab I tak tahu
yang tu jer
tapi I rasa macam activity tu not so important actually the ones that is more important to me is the travelling part lah
ah betul juga
but then like travel bubble kalau you boleh cadangkan travel bubble you rasa travel bubble dengan siapa
you get to pick five countries yang mana lima country yang you rasa you nak
you nak travel bubble dengan
tapi philippines dengan indonesia I would be very afraid
because philippines is uh dengan indonesia
ya because the two of them sekarang ni memang tengah competing and then philippines competing to be the winner
so rasa macam I don't I would not feel safe kalau we have travel bubble dengan mereka
ah new zealand new zealand is good ya memang cantik and I heard the prime minister is very good also mm
so ya I heard she has been doing her very well with the number of the COVID nineteen cases lah di di negara dia kan
so macam tu lah so biasanya you ada baca news kan Channel News Asia
yang macam mana yang ada apa like
apa rapist siapa
dalam Channel News Asia they reported that oh my god that is so sad kan
esok uh kerja lah apa lagi aiyo so everytime
uh kerja memang kerja from work from home lah tapi once I think about kerja I macam stressed sikit because I've been working twenty four seven
so I rasa macam I need a break lah
I tak boleh visit rumah orang tua lah sia COVID
macam mana I nak visit orang tua tak boleh lah
malas lah I rasa macam I kat duduk kat rumah I sleep cukup
ya betul
everytime tak boleh tidur because got problems trying to sleep lah insomnia kan
mm but then I don't want to take too much ubat also I want to make sure that I can fall asleep naturally
my house mate kan dia balik
then dia tidur kat sini
boyfriend dia tak ada so boyfriend dia tinggal kat tempat dia sendiri lah so
managed to buy me McDonald's breakfast dia ada buy one for one
ah murah
so macam tu lah eh you tahu tak rambut I kan lepas I dye dia merah dah kan
warna dia when my rambut is wet kan warna dia masih like
terlekat kat pillow I
you know my hair ni memang kan red
so I rasa macam
the hair dye that the hairdresser used tak berapa bagus ah because everytime I after when it's wet it's wet
two weeks already and it's will still stain baju kau there is no way that the thing is still like that betul tak
ya exactly this is lepas dua minggu dah and then dia masih stain baju dengan
but only bila dia basah
so it stained like my towel juga lah stain stain merah
mana boleh kalau kering pun it's uh ya but it's
[ah] betul there ah
so but then ah dia beli lah during um during apa ni
Harvey Norman singapore ada sales
jadi dia beli dari Harvey Norman lah
ya it was a a birthday surprise dia order dari Harvey Norman singapore
Harvey Norman singapore tu deliver kat I lah mm and I didn't know then when they ring the doorbell I was like
there was memang kelakar lah because the guy was like this one is for you I said I didn't order this he said oh your mum
so macam tu lah
oh we said we wanted to go to apa ni
and then kita masih belum pergi Holey Moley kan
I pernah dah ajak tapi you sibuk apa
kawan I lah yang seorang lagi
a'ah betul
ya tapi I ajak you you tak reply
sebab I tanya you nak pergi ke tak
pas tu you kau tak reply
tak tahu lah you busy every day lah ada banyak kawan kau
ah betul
uh kalau cycling I pengsan
susah lah I cannot lah if you ask me to go and do all these things
mm betul
ah tak boleh lah exercise
I tahu tapi I you you kan tahu I ni memang malas
nanti gemuk lah
it's okay lah kalau I gemuk
memang lah
oh and then you tahu tak
like sekarang ni kan I memang nak invest in stocks tapi I tak tahu macam mana
do you invest in stocks ke tak
orh I nak tapi I tak tahu macam mana nak start
oh boleh ke
tapi I nak ah
so you dah invest lama ke
oh dah lama ke
because I because I masih muda lagi kan
so I ni kena like willing to take the risk lah
mmhmm betul betul
okay tapi I nak start dengan
okay bagus
tapi because
if you want to invest in the share market you kena apa ni you kena start an account with with your bank right
is it with your banks or bukan macam tu
so macam macam lah
ya kalau gitu pun
ha betul lah
tak ada lah
tak ada lah tak ada investment
sebab itu lah susah sikit that's why I need to start thinking about my future kan
then like worried about like money and then sekarang job I ni pun tak ada commission
so I kena that's why I sekarang ni sibuk nak cari back a sales job so that I can get a bit of commission
project project macam ini kalau kita ada lebih then I don't have to worry so much
kalau project project macam ni memang lah I nak join
so rasanya tak tahu lah kalau mm
the share market investment I memang interested lah but then like
memang nak ah sebab tu that's why originally I was saving up my money untuk apa ni um
untuk sebab I nak belajar sepatutnya
tapi tu juga memang mahal kat
enam puluh ribu lebih susah lah
I rasa macam kalau boleh I nak study medicine juga tapi medicine kan I was thinking should I actually like
so but then career change susah sikit because like
macam mana I nak career change where do I start even kan so kalau I nak buat medicine medicine pun mahal
medicine is kira kira kalau kita study dekat australia
yang tu boleh but then but then you need to have the other additional like training lah
ah other additional training kalau you study dekat australia boleh sebab I ada seorang kawan dia memang
dia study kat monash university and then dia doctor lah kat sini
but then medicine tu mahal lah so
these kind of things you need money also if you want to switch your career and how you want to start all over and get certified so susah sikit lah
tengok lah that's why I pun tak tahu
no it's okay yang tu is out of the window I tak mahu
I nak kerja untuk diri sendiri I nak make sure that you know the money in the bank is mine and that
I tak dependent lah on anybody
parents okay lah kan parents kat singapore macam tu lah
tapi susah sikit lah because you know memang
so when you have two old parents here in singapore you kena
tak tahu lah
ada lah tapi pun susah nak keluarkan so kena tengok lah macam mana
ya betul
so tengok macam mana lah
biasanya bapa yang tak nak pi holiday mak yang nak mak nak pi holiday lah mak pernah pi holiday juga mak I bawa dia pi
I bawa dia pi aiyo banyak tempat lah sebab the job before this kan memang I had to travel and at that time
tak ada COVID lagi tak ada uh tak ada restrictions for travelling so
rasanya I brought her to a lot of places I brought her to
mm mana lagi I brought her to
at first originally kita nak pi vietnam this year sepatutnya I nak bawa dia pi vietnam especially end of the year when it's cold
either vietnam ke chiang mai because she likes cold places lah
and then I wanted to take her to cold places that is not expensive tak terlalu mahal kan
so vietnam atau chiang mai lah tapi sekarang mana mana pun tak boleh pi
so susah sikit lah duduk rumah tengok Netflix jer lah
tak tahu lah
aiyo dia ni
bapa I pun satu suruh dia pi suruh dia pi holiday
johor pun dia tak nak pergi
ah so memang susah lah sikit
ya lah mak I pernah pernah lah she wanted to go via this
travel agency pi holiday tapi susah sikit lah kalau you pi with travel agency I takut
mm tapi kalau they travel with travel agent kan
bukannya mahal ke because they will bring you to all these touristy areas
that like you know that akan charge you like really high prices
so susah sikit bukan
even makanan juga dia bawa you tempat yang mahal
mmhmm betul
mmhmm betul lah
mm betul juga
lazarus island tu yang paling jauh I pergi ah duduk ferry tu pun I tertidur dalam ferry
oh betul ke you pernah pergi ke lazarus island oh
oh macam mana hari tu kau pergi
oh betul ke berpeluh
tapi hari tu bila I pi kan cuaca tu tak berapa baik
aku ambil umbrella tu abeh aku jalan from one from since the jetty
to the beach aku dalam umbrella tu sahaja
pas tu we were there only for one hour I dengan kawan I
kawan I ni lah kan dia yang ajak aku pi
then macam mana aku nak dia pun cakap ah tak apa tak apa
nanti tak akan hujan aku memang dah tanya dia aku tanya oh okay even though we have bought the ferry ticket
you nak tukar ke another day ah because
kan sekarang ni hujan lebat then we go there we cannot even picnic ke nak buat apa apa pun tak ada then umbrella pun kecil sangat
so then after that dia cakap tak apa tak apa hujan tak hujan akan err nanti dia akan
uh reda dah ah so kita continue with our trip anyway
so I cakap okay lah continue with our trip and then
enam orang lima orang sorry bukan enam
oh ya betul juga I terlupa lima orang ugh
nampak pula a'ah betul
ya kenapa pula I boleh terkira tambah seorang ah okay tak apa so ada lima orang kan
and payung tu memang kecil kecil ha
and then almost lah the wind blew away the payung and everything so end up we all just sat kat jetty tu waited for the ferry for two hours
ya tapi I memang suka bila dia cuaca tak berapa panas kan bila dia cuaca hujan I memang suka
kan I nak pergi tapi tengok lah kalau weekday I memang tak boleh sebab I kena ambil leave kalau weekend okay lah tapi weekend susah juga sebab I takut ramai orang lah
I ni memang kena clear leave tapi I tak nak ambil
I tak nak ambil leave on a on a weekday that is like a random day kan because I takut like
my boss will also kacau I
ah the the most strategic way of doing this is bila boss I
ah so dia tak akan kacau I
mm betul juga
mm so macam tu lah
huh you go all the way for a massage don't you think that's like really far away tak akan singapore tak ada massage kat sini
oh so biasanya you pandu kereta pergi situ bukan ambil uh apa ni ambil uh train lah
this neighbour of mine kan dia ni memang suka suka
buang sampah dia kat
luar the place where they are supposed to throw the rubbish bukan dalam chute tu tapi buang dekat luar
tak tahu lah and then uh
no or sometimes dia memang dah buka itu chute
so like tapi dia tak tutup properly so then or or they didn't push the rubbish properly into the chute all the way down
so bila I nak buang sampah when I bawa keluar I buka tu sampah tu masih ada kat situ
memang lah macam itu
ya so I wrote an email to management lah then I suruh management please remind everybody to
management cakap okay ah do you know who is in err who is the culprit
mana I boleh tahu hais ask me this kind of questions
macam tu lah
mm betul
minggu ni tak ada lah I nak tidur then I nak tengok Netflix
Netflix sekarang ni I nak tengok uh weekend ni I nak tengok enola holmes and then I nak tengok
I nak tengok
movie tu err kau rasa cinta
kau tak pernah dengar ke movie tu kau rasa cinta
ada lah movie ni popular
because I scared later I fall asleep lah when I tengok K drama
kau ada nampak video TikTok tu yang I bagi you tengok semalam tak
kelakar kan
ya I think I probably spend like six hours on TikTok I even like I ada pun uh send apa ni my job application to TikTok juga
I memang nak kerja dengan TikTok kalau TikTok nak hire I I memang nak
so technically kan I ni memang TikTok researcher dah
so kalau dia nak hire I I boleh cakap this is the amount of time I spend on your product I memang boleh join product you
tak nak lah
as if boleh jadi popular dengan TikTok bukannya senang sangat
tak ada lah
mana boleh senang lah cakap but then when you want to do it kan memang difficult a bit lah
memang uh okay I don't think my voice is merdu lah tapi tengok macam mana lah
malay song mm macam boleh juga tapi I rasa macam bila I cakap malay it's smoother lah kalau nyanyi malay not so
mm eh you tahu tak hari tu kan um
I pergi Holey Moley dengan norza kan I dah cakap tadi
this one seorang lelaki ni dia memang kerja kat situ as a waiter
then after that dia cakap kalau
uh if if he dia memang singaporean lah tapi dia ada relatives kat malaysia
budak melayu lah ni so then after that dia cakap oh um next time kalau you nak make booking kat Holey Moley for a table reservation ke apa you boleh call I lah
so dia ambil nombor I
then after that dia letak mm ah then then dia ambil nombor I then dia letak nombor dia dalam telefon I sebab telephone I memang ada kat
kat meja so then dia cakap eh you ambil lah nombor telephone I so next time kalau you nak reserve apa ke
you boleh call I so I cakap okay that's fine I'll do it
dia asyik text I
and I dah bagi tahu dia yang memang I dah ada boyfriend
and dia cakap oh
uh kalau dia dia cakap hari tu dia cakap apa ah
uh dia cakap oh
um bila you free
I nak bawa you keluar uh and then dia then dia cakap I nak bawa you keluar dengan Vespa I
Vespa dia then aku cakap um
kenapa I nak duduk Vespa kalau public transportation memang ada air con
then tapi ya so no lah but it's not just that it was like I dah memang dah bagi tahu yang I ada boyfriend
tapi dia masih muka tebal tau and then dia masih text I so I rasa macam
that's really weird so I I just straight up was like honest dengan dia and I bagi tahu lah that like
ah so I rasa macam dia tak ada boundary actually the thing was
I only save nombor dia sebab dia cakap
that kalau next time I nak reserve table I boleh call dia so I ingat like service dia bagus ke apa I wanted to write like a feedback on Facebook
kat Holey Moley yang dia ni memang baik ke apa
tapi turns out dia ni memang tak like like
asyik kacau I jer so I rasa macam a bit
mm macam tu lah
uh saya rasa I saya tak nak
I memang dah berterus terang I dah cakap I ada boyfriend
then after that dia ah then dia masih muka tebal lagi dia cakap oh
oh um I okay jer uh because dia cakap oh
um um so I would like to invite you for my birthday dinner then I'm I cakap
ah then aku rasa aku tanya dia only you and me
then dia cakap tak lah then they said uh then he said
dengan kawan kawan I
then dia cakap with a group of friends bukan you dengan I jer then the then he said
I tahu you you you tak you tak nak hang out one on one
tapi I okay jer
then I rasa macam the way he responded to it was very
it doesn't matter if you are okay with it ke tidak because you are
tapi kalau orang dah ada boyfriend atau girlfriend I don't think it's
ah so macam tu lah
then then aku tanya dia just you and I then dia cakap tak lah dengan kawan kawan I
tapi dia masih hari ni lagi ajak I pergi birthday dinner
pas tu I cakap
dia and then the way dia cakap kan
dia text I dia cakap oh
so I was but bukan I yang ajak dia keluar dia yang nak ajak I then I was like
mungkin you kena panggil uh then I said err maybe you just enjoy with your friends lah and have a good
pas tu dia cakap um
dia cakap err
bila I free
so it's like again you are coming back to that topic when I dah cakap
I memang dah tak bagi signal apa I tak uh it it's totally no signal it's disconnected
so I rasa macam it's just
ya but any way aku dah tak reply dia lah
ya betul juga
bukan lah dah pernah happen a number of times
no lah I mean uh no but anyway ya that was just off topic so coming back to this um apa ni COVID kan so um
in london COVID nineteen memang dah um
mm macam that time dalam kat australia
mm yang tu pernah happen dalam japan pun and then now they said that the
the virus dah mutate
betul juga but then only the young ones will have herd immunity the old ones would not be able to survive or the ones with underlying disease
so yang tu yang susah lah
mm tapi vaccine sekarang pun macam ada side effect
because I think sekarang ada tiga company yang tengah buat vaccine
no there is one that's Sanofi albert dengan AstraZeneca
Pfizer juga I think all of them are on board with that kot
sekarang ni albert memang memang apa ni uh memang aggressive to to do COVID because I nampak ada
for a number of um albert punya infectious disease department
ada lah tapi dia tak call I balik because I tak ada experience dalam infectious disease kot
mungkin boleh juga tengok macam mana lah
ada lah I think now they are busy with the campaign the presidential campaign it feels like I feel like this COVID thing has
yang U orang dengan dengan like
so that's why it turns out everybody pula yang terkena COVID
I rasa lah yang ni I rasa lah
ya betul
ya betul
betul lah
mm betul juga
but it's true I mean uh you know negara kita ni
memang lebih bagus lah
negara lain lain di southeast asia tapi negara kita ni memang
memang you know as much as what anybody else says negara kita ni memang terbaik
orang orang lain nak masuk negara kita untuk kerja kan orang malaysia ni
orang indonesia
orang china orang philippines kan ah
there err and memang ada semangat
nationality lah kat singapore
mm betul
ah ang moh tu apa ang moh
oh ang moh tu orang putih lah
oh okay okay ha betul lah
ya betul
jadi mungkin minggu ni kita nak pi botanical gardens ke tak
ya sebab I rasa
betul juga sebab I rasa macam botanical gardens ada satu cafe yang memang cantik
then dia ada like I pernah pergi dah lama dah um
and then dia ada yang rooftop tu memang glass rooftop and dia transparent and then boleh nampak everything
bukan Wildseed Wildseed ke kat botanical gardens bukan Wildseed tu terlalu
nampak dia terlalu nice and terlalu expensive yang tempat ni memang basic tapi makanan dia okay juga
mm tak tahu kalau ramai ke tak mungkin kita kalau kita pergi
pagi-pagi kan then tak akan lah begitu
jadi kau tidur lah awal sikit
okay then kalau gitu kan I dah cakap
kita pergi botanical gardens makan breakfast so macam mana kita nak makan breakfast kalau nanti lambat lambat
okay boleh juga
kalau ramai tengok lah kalau boleh reserve ke apa nanti kita Google lah
mm lepas botanical gardens I nak pergi
mm I nak balik tidur
sebab you kan tahu I ni memang bangun awal okay kalau lepas botanical gardens maybe kita gi orchard tengok ada benda nak shopping ke tak
ramai orang kan a'ah ya lah
so okay kalau tak pergi orchard then kita nak pergi mana lepas ni eh
ah sentosa buat apa sentosa tu memang kena booking sekarang kau tahu tak
kena chope
to masuk
sebab tu everywhere sekarang ni kena chope then baik tinggal kat rumah jer aku tengok Netflix lah cukup
mm boleh juga tapi kan you sebab you pandu kereta so senang sikit tapi kalau untuk I I kena like
tengok mana yang convenient sikit kalau terlalu jauh I memang
you tahu lah I ni memang singaporean
kalau jauh sangat I tak nak travel
kalau I tak ada kereta lah kalau ada kereta okay lah
ya betul lah
mm boleh juga
boleh boleh juga mm
jadi I rasa macam
ah okay lah dah lewat
and I pun sudah nak tidur you dah nak tidur ke tak
mm betul I juga
esok I kerja tapi lepas ni I akan kerja lagi sebab I kena habiskan benda mmhmm
selalu banyak lah tapi I'm I also like procrastinated a little bit
because I rasa macam malas nak kerja cause every day I've been working non-stop kan
hmm so rasa macam tired sikit lah but I need to finish this project
betul lah
ya betul because um tadi house mate I baru cakap uh kawan dia
uh kawan dia punya husband ke apa atau mungkin kawan dia lah dia ni memang pilot
um dengan apa ni ke apa lah and then after that lost the job and now buat kat macam customer service or something lah
pay but have to still pay for the mortgage and such so ya susah sikit lah
oh so wife dia tak ada job lah
oh tapi dia ada apply ke tak untuk job
ah betul
so dia ada like that has she reached the level whereby like
dia memang dah interview and they've asked her to do a presentation
ada lah but didn't get the job oh wah susah kalau gitu kan lepas everytime kena buat presentation one after the other and then tak dapat job tu
dia kerja dalam what err what sector
oh dalam pun kena retrenchment
wah teruk lepas tu
tapi dia ada err package tak
ada lah then okay lah kalau ada package maybe because dia enam belas tahun dah
oh then okay lah yang tu
orh betul juga
mm betul then dia tak ada commitment
mm betul
ya and freeze hiring kan ya betul juga
bonus pun tak ya bonus pun tak ada
dengar dengar lah dari kawan I memang bonus pun tak ada
ya bukannya the COVID thing has been solved aiyo if we go through another year like that teruk lah macam mana
harap-harap lah kita dapat lebih project macam ini

ya I I ya semua kat rumah I yang tadi keluar
yang keluar breakfast
uh mister teh tarik is

as in part uh like me lah apa
so you said so so you just agak-agak lah
sembarang ah
can see not tak nampak
ni I'm pointing at it ni
ah pukul dua belas
but then jurong west tak banyak shift ah
jurong west tak banyak shift
every time I check for shift right banyak kat sengkang
ya tak ada
kalau macam dapat degree or
that that that time my friend uh intern dekat vietnam then she she went to what what was it ah
I forgot I forgot ah it's it's uh apa beach area ah
singapore punya different
at ni ah ni pun ada apa malaysia
kesian ah
uncle janggut
then boleh cakap jepun
buy a kampung house over there
she's busy jaga ija
jangan ah
her like stomach area sakit
sakit perut also not sakit perut
then from the living room I pergi buka pintu for my mum
then I gostan a bit and see
cun-cun my mum also ah
come bagi salam asalammualaikum warahmatullah then I'm like mak mak mak mak tak tahu apa nak buat then her carry her barang pasar
but I don't know what she's doing now ah I think dia tengah baring tidur
main-main you see
uh what are all those memes people makan the pot
tak tak I should recommend this to
front load tak boleh ni apa
is it macam laundromat
macam mana nak hmm
ya that was back then lah but sekarang dah kena buang kan so tak ada guna ah nak tengok tu semua balik
so aku rasa lebih aman ah kat sana
ah saudi arabia ah mecca rasanya kat mecca sana semua
no aku
uh aku tak pasti ah apa pasal corruption ni semua tapi I did read over the news that uh ya there were some corruptions by the make government or by the royalty by the royal families itself ah but then
amazing I would say sebab dorangnya taste
a bit different from asian nya culture dorangnya makanan lebih masin sikit lah and it might be hard to find in singapore or asia itself
I will to get a chance to meet messi ah you know I like I mean both of us like to watch and play football right so if there's a chance I would want to go there and meet him ah tapi
disebabkan COVID period kan aku rasa no chance lah nak gi sana nak jumpa atau maybe kita nak tengok bola kat sini pun dah tak ada tak ada chance kot
maksud kau kat mana kat negara luar atau in singapore
so far aku rasa dorang dah main dah start main cuma it's just that no ah spectators are allowed in the stadium ya cause if they totally stop the football industry right the football clubs will ah suffer a lot of loss ah cause they have sponsors coming so they still had to let the games to continue lah
actually tu yang aku pelik ah but then uh I did make a research ah on the internet and I found out that uh they make money through uh fans memberships the merchandises like example err satu apa ni baju bola kan they could sell for fifty pounds and they had millions of fans across the globe what so kalau satu kalau semua beli mungkin they could sustain themselves in a short period of time before they actually recover lah you know before the
ya aku rasa kau pun boleh tengok apa dekat facebook apa semua especially in singapore err aviation macam-macam kerja ah ramai orang kena buang tapi bagusnya err kita tengok singapore government they give a lot of grants and financial ah aids to um singaporeans ah
ah tak lah sekarang aku rest jer kat rumah sebab uh apa to stay close ah with my family
sebab you know I want to keep myself safe and
finding a job at this period I mean it might be subjective lah but I would say it's hard lah ah you know to find a job that ah that is suitable with me tapi
ye lah aku cuma sekarang aku cuma pakai duit savings aku ah alhamdulillah sebab aku dapat save for the past err
months that I've been working as air steward kalau tak mungkin aku kerja lah cari mana-mana kerja
aku actually risau juga cuma
alhamdulillah again aku dapat save quite a lot
I mean aku tak ada aku nak bilang kau kan but then ya I would err the savings that I save
oh ye lah aku
aku baca hari tu kat facebook juga
ah apa kerja as a swabber is it they could earn like
maybe cause err they are finding people who are willing to work uh a risk a risky job lah tu pasal they are willing to pay that much
tapi to volunteer to be a swabber I mean is a risky job so I don't think people would actually volunteer lah sebab bahaya kot buat kerja tu jadi maybe it's better if government pay them lah you know
a lot of people are losing jobs and they are taking a reduced pay and I wonder how people will be able to pay their bills their mortgage and et cetera lah you know tapi
nak cakap susah memang lah susah tapi memang perlu teruskan kehidupan kan jadi tu lah aku pun wonder on how singapore would cope with this um COVID nineteen lah
and tu pasal aku rasa penting lah untuk err ada plan lah untuk masa depan tak semestinya kena cepat-cepat nak kena kahwin atau beli rumah sebab banyak lagi yang kena fikir sebelum membeli apa sebelum ada anak sebelum ada family atau beli rumah aku rasa
err you know a lot of children I don't know lah maybe for them it's a rezeki but in terms of singapore context
primary school children kan tak payah bayar school fees ke or maybe edusave bagi lebih banyak sikit ke you know
you know you got to pay that you got to pay this aku kadang-kadang pening ah sebab aku dapat gaji jer aku kena kasi
apa ni adik-adik aku eh sorry adik-adik aku pula aku mana ada adik kan aku kena kasi mak aku abeh aku kena bayar bill aku kena bayar macam-macam lagi ah then aku kadang-kadang barely aku cuma ada kadang-kadang five hundred for myself like in every month
so walaupun I would say I'm not saying I'm in a comfort zone but
I mean I sometimes I really wonder macam mana orang-orang yang err sewa rumah atau mempunyai apa ramai apa ramai anak lah you know rumah mereka macam mana dorang bayar tau dorang punya duit makanan duit sewa rumah duit bayar bill
being raped which I'm totally uh angry about tapi tu lah aku pun tak boleh buat apa-apa sebab aku pun duduk singapore mungkin kalau aku ironman mungkin aku akan pergi sana lah aku nak save dorang tapi dalam keadaan sekarang aku cuma boleh mampu doa kan dorang ah
tak kau kau rasa kau rasa apa macam kalau err ye lah sedara kau sendiri
tak ke tak ke pelik kau sanggup untuk pukul budak kecil I mean mungkin kalau kau mak bapa mak bapa pun kau tak sepatutnya pukul budak-budak tu tapi
ini kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua I really
ya I really err I'm really disappointed that um the muslims are treated that way and also another case is sekarang ni happening in this world is
uh present representation of the whole community and as you can see in eh aku tengok err kenapa police dorang err
apa treat all those uh black people with such violence and brutality
where recently kalau kau tengok news err satu orang dorang siapa nama dia george floyd was killed
err aku tak tahu apa yang tak
police police tu fikir lah sampai sanggup nak bunuh apa err orang tu dia setakat err apa ni ada fake duit jer which is twenty dollar counterfeit bills so I don't think it's fair for them to hold him on the ground and kill him intentionally in front of people
err orang masih boleh you know kita duduk dalam negara yang berbilang bangsa kan aku rasa kita masih boleh hidup dalam aman cuma
dekat sana ada this thing called bumiputera where the malays are given
wanted to buy this house at taman melawati lah you know in kuala lumpur or something but he can buy it at two hundred thousand but you can only buy it at five hundred thousand
you have you don't have that bumiputera rights where you can
should be bersyukur you know they could actually get everything at a cheaper cost be it houses healthcare and and you know what actually kan kalau dorang gi klinik they could actually
they uh dorang cuma perlu bayar one ringgit jer tau one ringgit for basic consultation whereas in singapore if you go to a
they err they are involved in this corruption of certain companies and kau aku fikir dorang ni tak rasa berdosa ke I mean
okay ah berdosa tu dah another level dorang tak rasa bersalah ke sebagai seorang menteri dorang ambil duit rakyat
duit eh rakyat dah bayar cukai dah bayar segalanya dorang ambil duit tu and they can just buy I don't know they heard I heard that they buy
kapal apa yacht eh I don't know how to pronounce that if they buy diamonds it's something wah that's no no I mean you don't have to be minister lah like that you know what you think about that
ya I mean let's say that he I mean he should have a lot of money as of now and mesti dia akan dapat lawyer yang bagus-bagus ah and he might win the case and just uh go off with a bail or maybe instead of twelve years he only can he will get in prison for one or two years ah so
is a joke you know is a joke you know kau kau tengok ah kita punya uh how how well
actually actually memang ada tapi err
uh he he's called the yang berhormat speaker you know he's the man in the centre that uh will call on each uh each minister to speak up speak on his opinions and points for his respective
I really err you know in melayu ah they say kesian ah with the speaker cause he always get shout get shouted at by the ministers
you know some of the ministers say eh speaker diam lah eh speaker apa ini you know they are very chaotic you know and
bro uh I don't find it weird ah cause sebab apa tau
all of the ministers actually ada fake degree you know he actually beli
di apa a fake degree on internet or something or apa eh dia suruh orang
pergi ambil degree for him so that he can have the degree for himself to eventually apply for future jobs or something lah I mean memalukan seh kau
I mean kau dah tak
kau atau kau malas atau kau tak pandai lepas tu kau nak suruh orang buat kan sebab kau nak dapat kerja yang bagus and
are recruited uh based on merit lah you know though he they are they really speak well they really project their points and their opinions well on how to improve the life of singaporean and ya aku aku happy ah macam singapore ada government yang stable ah walaupun ye lah ramai kata apa lah ni minister ni tak bagus lah minister tu tak bagus tapi
aku rasa kita nya government quite stable lah and aku happy to see that ya
eh actually aku terima soalan ni banyak gila ah dulu kan aku
aku fikir aku nak duduk malaysia the reason being is that
ah the peace and financial freedom mungkin sebab masa tu I mean still uh sampai sekarang lah aku masih kerja kat singapore kan and I'm earning singapore dollars
and when the money is converted uh into the malaysian currency it's time apa times three apa so satu dolar tiga ringgit and you when you go there kau boleh spend apa-apa kau beli makanan ni baju ni pergi apa spa apa bagai and kau boleh buat apa-apa ah tapi kau fikir balik kalau kau duduk sana
and kau kerja kat sana eh you might not be uh spending lavishly or you know living happily cause you are earning malaysia ringgit example you are earning two thousand ringgit in malaysia
you know early morning four and know people are still sleeping and kau baru bangun dah kena siap apa naik bus atau naik motor pergi kerja sini and okay lah mungkin kalau kau masih muda dalam twenty plus thirty plus it might be healthy for you to travel here and there from singapore to malaysia
sebab ya the you know the okay example kau bangun pukul empat pagi then kau kerja sampai lima pagi and you have to go through the jam probably can take you for two three hours and kau balik sampai rumah lapan malam
and you know kau barely have time for yourself ah you know kau rasa kau akan do that for a long term or
you know try to spend two thousand ringgit in a month there you know you wanna try living there two thousand ringgit I mean
of course ah it's not easy for them I mean aku pun ada sedara kat malaysia and they are actually
struggling actually live in ah you know dalam kampung-kampung semua and um kalau kat singapore apa orang kata is it or gross income lah dalam dalam satu rumah tu mungkin dalam seribu ringgit
atau seribu lima ratus ringgit and
it's still tak cukup you know cause they are living in a dalam rumah dah ada lima orang enam orang I mean mungkin barang-barang murah tapi
ye lah barang-barang lain macam bill makanan apa semua lah macam-macam and still tak cukup untuk dorang so we cannot really compare ourselves to them I mean everyone have their own struggles ah so we cannot justify on what they are facing ah but kan in singapore itself it's very hard you know
ya I mean okay in terms of religion in islam relationship before marriage is haram
I think it's very important you know to have more money to be stable I mean I think in singapore lah you know penting gila I I mean it's very important to be financially stable
I mean what's the point of you having a partner and you are struggling and you are expecting your partner to help you you know to tolong you to to uh you know to give duit I mean
and ya that that's why we the relationship in singapore is very complex and that explains ah birth rate in singapore is declining kan orang takut sangat nak ada anak sebab
ya dorang risau kan apa tak uh tak ada tak cukup duit lah tak ada time and
aku tak faham ah kenapa entah aku kalau ada anak aku tak akan tak akan ada maid aku tak akan ambil maid untuk jaga anak aku sebab
I I want to be there for my own children I don't want to I don't want my child to be nurtured by another stranger you know I want to you know besar I want to saya aku nak besar kan anak aku dengan kasih sayang aku sendiri bukan
setakat kerja daripada pagi sampai malam balik tengok sekejap they don't know I want to be there for them
you know give them kasih sayang lah kau kau rasa tak pelik ke kalau anak kau you know dibesarkan dijaga oleh maid and maybe one day dorang tak kenal kau atau maybe dorang sayang maid lebih dari kau
gitu lah I mean
to have a to have enough money is very important lah singapore kan kalau kau
kau kau bayang kan kau spend
it's not even compulsory pun to have your own wedding
so yang penting I mean in our religion islam kita nikah dah cukup
tak penting pun then after that
ya I mean the the money that you supposedly want wanted to spend on your wedding right might as well you spend dekat kau punya rumah kau can pay lebih deposit
ya lah aku rasa rumah and uh duit um savings untuk anak kau lagi penting lah
I don't know ah okay sekarang sekarang err I'm in army kan so
ya I think sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi
like you cannot go places a lot of places ah banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi
atau dia punya ada limit
ada limit to entry ah
err kalau ah tak tak tak sekarang masih masih five juga
ah betul
mm bukan ah
I don't know but I think tengok tengok apa like orang lain yang instagram stories nampak
ada ramai orang cakap tak ada in the same venue tapi
so macam
ah macam pagi family then err petang just kawan-kawan dengan friends
oh iya ke
ah yours is ah that yang yang jemputan
ah evening semalam only semalam I posted about it
so macam it's a bit contradictory
macam err
memang I don't keep myself up to date that much

I sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang kan
okay kalau tengok in army in army
berbeza kalau compared to police dengan itu memang

this is gonna be super senang for me
apa okay
ya alah so this is my last semester kan sekarang so
classes that's only like once a week so aku macam like
but it's so much like cause the previous semesters uh I was like so freaking like stressed but now I'm still stressed lah you know sebab sekolah standard but now I feel like
so I was supposed to submit an assignment not assignment lah like a task macam homework yesterday but then like she didn't give me my feedback sought
aku mad ah so I didn't submit
for my time table tak banyak apa punya classes
macam like start at like twelve but like the bad part is balik rumah like lambat so
kau stand out sikit lah
no kau tahu that kind of situation where ada orang wave kat kau and then they're not actually waving at you
so why so kenapa kau mad kat aku for the okay uh huh
so kau fikir yang
you thought like I was giving you some uh attitude gitu lah okay got it
oh kau tengah flex on aku pasal dover dover oof
sometimes I really miss just like being able to like pergi sekolah kau without
I thought kata takde like COVID punya
orh I think confirm like my sekolah mala is like
confirm ah tak halal mala
cause like I went cause remember I told you last week the korean punya stall aunty dia kata
oh aku dapat apa ada mala and I saw like my malay friend apa apa nama dia uh izzah from izzah is from band remember izzah my
yang tu ya ya ya
pray I was like to allah to count my blessings semua
no I have you eaten there before kau pernah makan
oh ya the daging mahal ya
that time aku makan dengan arlef uh makan mala dekat I think it was last year
the duck rasa lemak dia sedap
your bapa never let you go makan
macam not my type of food do you agree
no like no the one yang at Ichikokudo
to me rasa dia terlampau rasa dia terlampau lemak because aku makan dia punya
the fact that it's garlic dia dah cut
but it was super like lemak for some reason and cause I didn't take spice I didn't put the spice also why didn't you going as far as I didn't like wanted to be
ya stomach aku ada problem bro aku tak boleh makan spicy food period
tapi I that time I eh you know oh my god I forgot to tell you about this
no because when you add less of the sauce dia punya flavor
to me untuk aku because Samyang kan uh the normal noodles dia punya calories about five hundred
sebab you know like you put it like there's less ties to numb your tongue
to me dia nya carbonara dia nya rasa terlampau
almost bukan
dia nya rasa almost bukan Samyang and babe abeh dia punya noodles also not macam
something that aku eat
aku tak makan that kind of stuff
kau makan dia punya cup atau dia punya
no cup atau the packet
oh aku prefer aku think there's a like a
the cup one I feel like it doesn't like kau try makan Samyang cup biasa not even carbonara the texture semua lain what
no kenyal is like err perkataan yang betul
oh you kau tengah looking through universities eh
paolo kat yes correct
oo aku uh dia punya course is uh sciences sosial
kejap eh
oh dorang ada human resource dengan uh itu
passionate tentang human resource
okay aku I I know akan
sound a bit dunia
I don't know tapi sebab
macam aku really nak try pergi overseas ah
aku just thinking because it might it's not really plausible for me to go overseas because of finances
macam a real thing is it will take two years only if I go overseas
instead of three years I'm aku looking at western australia nya uni kan kat perth
abeh dia punya fees about thirty eight thousand
tiga puluh lapan ribu uh per tahun
if aku punya is eligible untuk scholarship
abeh accommodation I can stay with my uncle tapi dia punya orang was like betul ke kau nak tinggal dengan uncle kau
ya abeh when she was talking to me dia kata are you sure you really wanna stay with your aunty because I mean it's not really a good idea kan untuk tinggal dengan kau punya sepupu semua
so aku fikir forty thousand extra that's
true sebab aku punya uncle dengan aku punya aunty dorang punya rumah is
quite near to university tau like macam actually dekat
abeh dorang ada banyak bilik spare cause dorang nya anak semua dah besar dah kahwin
tapi kalau gitu I have to take a gap year untuk kerja dapat duit
ya abeh kerja kat mana
dah start eh
a'ah betul
dah besar lah
mak dia nak ikut dia pergi overseas
oh mak dia attached to her eh
no but sebab dia dia youngest in the family what so I think it's like expected ah
tapi what I thought you said she's like financially like
tapi her mum let lah is it taking a loan
daphne is the one yang
oh tapi when kau tengah keluar dengan kawan kau do you guys talk about pelajaran atau completely like no
oh so your yours are just casual friends ah like bukan competitive
oh korang macam united ah
eh tapi elisa dia nak pergi university mana satu
dorang ada plan
tapi elisa mak dia bagi tak kalau dia nak
kerja sana kan
kau tahu tak the main macam
sebab that people nak pergi negeri lain kan is because dorang nak migrate tau
like for example kan aku pergi uh perth for university there most likely I would want to settle down there also
that kind of like no as in like if people go macam for
like uh someone from singapore dorang nak uh apa
belajar kat america boston university
so it's like it's meant to like macam
facilitate dorang untuk keluar negeri kita
so macam like the thing about ambil
I saw this uh tweet pasal this guy they took a hundred thousand loan tak salah aku hundred thousand ke hundred fifty thousand untuk uh go to apa university di america
abeh lepas tu he he they took a very big loan right but he got a job starting salary tujuh ribu
so it's like macam the starting pay is a lot what seven thousand is a lot eh
ya I mean if I feel like in negeri america
dorang nya starting pay quite high seh
untuk ah aku punya perspective
no bukan hope it's more of worry macam if aku pergi overseas education what if aku tak boleh bayar balik
right ten year gitu kan
mmhmm abeh ya
not really I didn't make much memories that's why I want to make sure aku punya university aku make as much memories as possible
kalau boleh aku nak give it another run lah
not choose my class kau tahu kan time aku masuk poly I actually chose to be in O two
and that time dina was my only friend kawan aku satu jer
so aku was like okay let me just be in the same class as dina but if I were to redo it again I would appeal into the same course I don't know
I think kalau boleh aerospace sia
but ya so about local university kau nak pergi mana satu and like
not like like course sebab I know kau tak tahu like
uh kau I think I can see you're like interested dalam
bidang uh social services
is it kau punya internship open up your eyes
oh kau tak nak ah
the jutawan di dalam kelas kamu
aku percaya dia ah
oh return of investment gitu eh
um okay investment aku boleh percaya
tapi hundred thousand tu aku tak boleh percaya
oil banyak ah tapi
mana parents dia dapat duit tu untuk start investment in the first place
oh kalau gitu aku macam boleh percaya sikit
ah sikit ah
uh tapi okay lah makes sense tapi ya you were saying dia punya internship
oh kau share tentang internship kau eh
uh huh tu nanti
ya period abeh dia end up kerja di mana
tapi same place tapi online
dia business vibes ah
oh tentang addison rae
aku just I think I'm aku just
dia seorang businesswoman yang sangat gigih
dia jumpa kourtney kardashian
aku rasa kan dia yang paling banyak um
dia punya dia seorang yang sangat gembira all the time
no no the thing the thing yang aku sedikit marah
eh marah
kau do you know avani
kau pernah nampak videos dia tak
no no no kau pernah nampak video dia tak
dengan james charles eh
no aku rasa the only reason I mean I know you say jangan tengok video dia kalau tak suka kan
tapi the only the thing is I don't think dia deserve all this fame
dia punya ya
aku tengok dia collab dengan james charles tau di YouTube
and when they were talking she was completely sangat bosan as a person like I literally macam couldn't
ya abeh charli d'amelio pun aku rasa she don't deserve I mean she's a good dancer
ni something yang aku have been thinking about ah serious
ya nice but does nice deserve hundred million followers kau kata yes ke tak
no aku rasa okay what makes me like a bit angry about charli d'amelio is dia punya latest video dengan maddie ziegler
the dorang buat makeup
dan the way she talk is so soft okay soft can be a good personality but it's like no substance and like no
ya that itu apa apa aku fikir lah tentang situasi ini
but then again their net worth is like berapa million so aku have nothing on them
oh okay aku faham
cuma aku just uh aku baik dengan dorang aku aku think dorang sangat
dorang dah dalam bidang menari dan stuff like that
tapi I just don't think they deserve this much followers lah
based on how they talk like they cannot talk they can't host like macam
circumstantial I feel like because of quarantine semua orang dalam uh
phone dorang so
and I think dorang punya it factor comes from not talking it's just the videos they make
ya so I don't think dorang deserve all these big opportunities you know
yang uh miniman yang baru eh
oh yang trend baru eh
no I don't aku tak minum Starbucks ah bro
oh kau dapat anxiety macam mana
oh ya malam tu eh
kau that time yang aku minum kopi aku nak pass out kau ingat
ya no is yang I drank the whole cold brew remember
yang kita minum tau it's like that coffee drink
that night yang aku nak pass out sebab aku exercise after that
ya aku nya heart was already like dying aku literally was like
abeh I thought running would help it but running makes your heart rate high but then it like macam complicates things aku literally was like about to pass out
drink coffee at all that time aku minum uh
I didn't like I eat at twelve you know like usual lunch tapi aku belum makan dinner and it was already like six and I was already very hungry no snacks nothing
so I was like hmm mak aku ada instant coffee so aku nak try minum jer lah
so aku minum then after that it was okay
but then I ate dinner at about seven thirty gitu like one hour later
time aku makan dinner suddenly aku rasa macam light not light-headed tau macam
abeh tu semua masa nak pass out terus I had to like stop dinner and like sit and like drink water
ya weird kan aku banyak pass out situations sia
ya tak boleh serious
aku macam aku just don't drink air flavoured ah
uh usually I get the like the like the fruity type macam kat rumah amira that time I drank
aku constantly telling you
Sharetea nya lemak kan rasa dia
it's like sikit tea
like two per cent tea abeh ninety nine per cent milk
dekat Dunkin' kau beli matcha I didn't know what doughnuts you buy but anyways

uh dia nya first yang basic dengan
okay not to flex tapi aku aku masuk
uh aku masuk bilik aku masuk lambat kan dia nya final theory room
oh student do not required to book simulator lessons for this course means kau manual tak yah naik tak yah itu ke
or maybe sebab kau sekolah bukan private
kau next time kau tanya instructor kau ah when's your next uh lesson driving

he only manjas me when he need something macam nak makan gitu baru he come to me
tapi kalau tak he ignore me he got attitude one
tapi semalam molly macam manja dengan aku sikit so aku macam okay

kenapa bad terms
macam mana amira tahu yang safirah nangis
apa safirah kata
no aku aku macam tak
but aku just feel like safirah do you think safirah overreact atau like she react accordingly
aku just tak suka rafi ah
no macam when I first nampak rafi I knew I I wasn't gonna like him
but most of the time aku punya intuition is right though whenever I have a bad feeling about someone it always happens
wait what other things aku I remember like getting a lot of things right macam regarding all these sus things
but aku feel like aku reacted accordingly though like
that's why I don't feel like super bad because aku rasa just safirah is like overreacting
ya tak no kejap aku nak explain dengar aku dulu
okay so basically yang pasal tu yang kita keluar dengan xu shi aku xu shi dengan safirah makan
safirah kan masuk Instagram dia then I was like I told safirah I'm super angry
aku macam nak message dia gitu ah macam just to
say everything ah macam like why you do this to safirah and all abeh safirah was like no
cause she dia tak reply aku tau do you dia reply kau
abeh apa perasaan kau when dia reply
apa perassan kau when safirah replied
apa kau punya fikiran tentang business dari rumah
oh kau suka makan benda manis-manis eh
oh ya doughnuts are nice to me aku suka doughnuts tapi it's like air
aku that time the last time aku makan doughnuts is the Swee Heng aku suka yang that kind of doughnuts
yang sedap yang besar abeh ada chocolate rice kat atas so sedap
ya I feel like Dunkin' Donut nya lagi air airy
kan macam tak tak tak kenyang
oh kau suka complicated flavours ah kira kan
aku just rasa
sedikit sedih ah tentang this situation
safirah needs I told I told my mum about situasi safirah tau about the entire break up
abeh aku macam aku I know safirah dia terlampau serious untuk relationship
kahwin which is good
is bukan perkara yang jahat tau untuk buat gini
tapi aku rasa dia terlampau serious when the guys are literally like
mana macam it's macam tak add up gitu
like dia nak settle down sekarang which is so unrealistic at this modern day and age
like when dia message dia kata oh kenapa semua orang atau semua orang masih sekolah
she's nineteen lah I mean like kalau nak kahwin at least twenty three baru find a real like a serious one lah
I feel like it's a bit macam terlampau cepat
my mum my mum said macam you shouldn't like you gonna break your heart
you know what I mean like it's so tiring to like go into this cycle macam kau percaya orang ni
abeh last last dia pecah kan hati kau macam gitu jer
ya tapi aku just feel bad ah
then macam do you know about safirah punya parents
no but because like I was also telling my mum like macam my mum said if you come from a stable family
like most likely you won't be out there macam looking for like
no macam like falling like for the first guy you talked to that kind of vibe
that was uh itu yang terjadi kepada irfan apa the first time also

that's the difference ah aku sebab
err that is macam
macam tu aku fight is ya ya ya
ya because from secondary school so I mean wait from primary school aku
uh sepak takraw pe so
that that competition macam orang tengok is normal
aku since young uh aku
not really sociable lah aku is a introvert ya
since primary school lah aku introvert so
but primary school lah aku still had this macam close friends so aku still okay secondary school also I had close friends but
still join takraw which is good and made a lot of friends there
okay that's the tough part sebab aku
aku didn't really got problem thus aku student counsellor so so aku tak boleh macam mess up lah so basically but the student council part also aku it wasn't
and then err dorang kira kan
sebab aku really from a
aku considered mature for the age so my my teachers like nominate me to be student counsellor lah in sec two ya
aku actually tak nak sebab aku just just malas ah then so uh the funny thing is
aku didn't even go for the interview even though I had to lah
dorang dorang naik dekat uh assembly hall panggil aku dorang tanya err
okay aku cakap ah I don't want to be student council then he say okay okay and like a week after that they like one of the student counsellors came up they say oh you got duty today then I'm like what
and then the and then the teachers would believe me ya nanti ada orang hantar aku
go to sick bay nanti aku cakap stomachache and all that
guilty tak sangat right ya then
but to be honest aku rasa dorang tahu lah tapi dorang just macam
macam okay ah can just go just go
aku first job aku was uh burger king which aku finds
so aku just join and then they quickly like train me
after staff day takde lagi
kind of lah because dorang macam err kira kan
uh business kecil so uh
macam referral kan so aku kerja
I think aku dapat thirty forty
kau kerja is a different environment
so kadang-kadang aku kat orang kahwin kadang-kadang aku kat macam some ah a'ah macam gitu just at some park or some event
eh apa dah kerja
for me I at least is why I chose this course engineering right at least is about sebab aku lagi prefer hands on
rather than macam
so next year kita dua gi internship
you quite excited ah untuk shore
uh aku
so aku gi belayar second sem
which is exciting ah untuk aku sebab aku pun join sebab dia punya sailing the part
exciting tapi
scary juga sebab aku aku tak tahu macam
sebab aku pun planning uh
aku start family and all that so ya
even though internship kau dapat shore kan
aku rasa there's still a chance untuk kau sail in the future you know macam kalau kau still carry on with this career then aku rasa why not kau ada dia punya diploma kau ada experience
takyah disappointed sangat
kau stuck at shore
yes sebab untuk aku err
aku rather sacrifice
aku punya time untuk uh
because it's it's not just okay can you imagine macam
ah exactly jadi untuk aku macam it's worth it lah kau go for six months
then got free for like like three months gitu three or more then
macam by the time aku reach macam tiga puluh empat puluh is
even workshop takpe sia fun so
aku suka ah
honestly following the trend kan aku rasa aku
we'll probably be posted to firefighting tapi personally aku nak army
ya sebab
aku tak tahu ah aku just
aku ada interest in the armed forces juga
kira the army navy ataupun air force ah
tapi firefighting pun untuk aku okay
tapi aku really tak nak
um macam dari dari kecil
aku main bola bawah blok ke apa kan atau aku gi skate ke apa nanti dorang datang screen abeh
ya and then since young aku had that uh
image of them macam dorang just
datang sini screen screen macam aku budak kecil kadang-kadang pun aku lepas sekolah
err aku pergi seven eleven beli maggi apa kan aku makan bawah blok tu pun dorang kadang-kadang datang dorang screen check check EZ-link semua aku don't find it
macam practical lah macam kau just kacau aku kan at this point ah so I never really had the interest for police
I think the the the bad part was sometimes check bag aku
maybe dorang check rokok ke apa abeh aku
aku just found it like like weird lah to be honest like until now also I still feel
I I take it personally ah sometimes but but I I try not to because sometimes also at nanti dorang tengok aku
dorang tengok eh kadang-kadang dorang panggil and dorang check bag aku macam just
but ya that's why aku tak nak police
then kau
eh tapi air force
macam mana nak cakap eh
macam ada engineering punya part ada communications punya part
I because to be pilot also susah
kalau dorang offer kau untuk macam uh continue
posted to air force eh kau kau rasa kau ambil tak macam macam
I think boleh tau sebab the thing is I went for the
ah ada dorang macam test kau punya
so macam
err aku betul-betul nak so
months before that kan aku aku practice with this movie so aku aku tengok youtube video
aku take online test
unfortunately aku tak dapat ah dorang tak bilang score
sebab dia ada aku rasa eight to ten different tests
uh ada yang aku rasa senang ada aku rasa susah
honestly overall aku rasa aku did not bad
ya so tapi tak kesah dapat tak dapat
okay obviously kalau ada
aku aku definitely would
honestly kalau
the job areas like engineering atau uh communications
kalau pilot lah who don't mind
sebab dia punya cockpit dia ada dia punya ah
aku tengok macam national days semua kan nanti ada dia punya jet like cool lah untuk aku
sama sama sama six years
so macam aku untuk aku primary school is when you develop your own uh character
sebab tu aku rasa untuk aku primary macam the most important
but ya primary school aku is uh
I think to through sepak takraw also
err develop aku punya own personality
is aku
I'm a quite macam quiet person
jadi aku dalam class pun aku macam diam aku dengar macam apa cikgu tengah berbual
err tapi bila aku join takraw baru aku macam
uh jumpa orang-orang ni semua and
I was quite good at it ah sebab abang-abang aku pun dari takraw
and then the coach was the one that macam kira recruit aku
through my brothers ah dia dia nampak aku dia cakap eh join ah join ah takraw
then then uh aku join and then
and then err it was funny ah sebab aku was
coach aku pun macam confident aku boleh main
I think by primary four aku managed to be captain of junior team
ya so at primary four aku the captain at junior team and then primary five aku captain of senior team
ya ya that's why dari situ aku macam belajar macam this leadership roles
macam macam mana nak uh
sebab dorang macam dorang jaga aku ah kat sekolah
kalau aku tak buat homework pun dorang macam marah
primary school was fun lah cause of takraw I mean
sebab kalau kalau err
tapi depending on tekong kalau dia left hand ke ya
uh kadang-kadang
and then if the tekong is left legged then feeder nak kena belajar campak
atau striker
tapi aku lagi suka striker
takraw was fun lah tu tu pun macam mana aku macam
belajar ah the
sekolah-sekolah ni semua masuk nationals
queenstown primary tak pernah dengar
tapi queenstown secondary ya
oh sebab aku rasa
okay aku remember primary five
against err since the first round kita
kita beat every school
the west zone okay so kita east zone err
uh school ada east north uh west dengan south
jadi kita dari east zone
jadi kita meet all these different schools yang kita tak pernah lawan pun tapi kita beat them ah
err using basics kita tak ada macam fancy fancy semua tapi coach kita ajar macam betul-betul master your basics
kita beat all these schools from
ya tapi aku
surprisingly national that time primary five kita beat dorang juga junyuan ya so kita macam kita ada this momentum ah which starting sampai finals kita tak kalah
uh menang qihua
second team kalah
and then so is it was one one and then my team had to win ah untuk champions
so macam every year since nineteen ya ninety ninety plus ada nama ni semua but never tampines north primary school
a'ah sia aku nangis rabak sia tu
aku really felt the responsibility ah
sebab kita punya vice principal kat situ
but the tampines north tak pernah achieve this kind of achievement
wait delta league apa
think macam
so aku
abeh aku nampak that time kau post kat instagram macam
dorang still cakap apa boys become last at least
dorang shouldn't macam just celebrate because you get at least fourth macam dorang should celebrate the change you know
wah takde love life lah okay tinggal macam four minutes
aku attached
aku jumpa dia through
dia pergi cambodia
okay so total sec two that time ada macam
ya boleh click ah so
but that time sec three uh dia suka orang lain
ah tapi aku don't mind sebab
just find her pretty you know macam I can
oh ya aku okay then
relationship dia tak work out
but awak awak tak rasa penting family time together to spend time with your family and then weekend tak dapat keluar sama-sama
mmhmm what about your family do they do they do they feel like they rather have you school in singapore or would they think like takpe you just belajar jer kat luar
luar negeri and then when when uh finish already graduation can come back singapore and have all the time with the family
okay okay cool next question if you have any unusual power what would it be sekiranya you have any superpower an unusual one what what do you think
saya okay
to cook masak tapi err with just a snapping with fingers
I need to be fast kerja nak siap nak mandi and
bagus kan
lambat sangat apa kata apa kata kita move on to the next question awak lambat sangat eh
okay soalan yang seterusnya adalah
um sekiranya awak menemui sebuah capsule masa daripada diri anda sendiri
sepuluh tahun yang lalu so if you have you found a time capsule of ten years ago
what would be inside apa kat dalam time capsule itu
tiga belas tahun second
budak baik ya macam
teruk I think it gives it took me
ya ya ya ya takde kawan banyak then recess tak makan sendiri
yes jujur
I don't like school I tak suka pergi sekolah cause
well I don't force it and and of course pergi sekolah takde duit and then had to
um tak beli makan no no the that point of time wasn't that really you know a thing you know they don't really give to just everybody you know and then
tak mahal yes
for me ya I agree too but I like the nasi ayam penyet or something
you you don't fan but I mean sedap</malay>it's cause uh ayam dia ranggup and then the night uh uh the rice
of course it is you see ah ya sedap and it's let's say the the ayam dia ranggup and then the rice is very fragrant that the
awak rasa awak chef
kimchi ramen ya you've always like something you know you always try you're always able to try something but for me I tak suka try new things I tak suka things that uh very foreign to me whatever I grow up with chicken uh chicken rice chicken and rice that's
you will eat ya you akan makan
itu itu important iya
itu important
kenapa dia berani sangat tanya soalan tu dekat someone
aku bukan apa yang kau cakap you know I'm not what you say I I am whoever I am
so if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would you do so as in manusia tak perlu kerja lagi
mesti lah soalan
okay jadi awak cakap awak
uh nak pergi travelling kan
tempat yang pertama sekali yang awak nak pergi the first place ever that you want to go
tak susah lah just think
why would you wanna skydive when you're scared of heights kenapa
saya bukan lelaki screw bullies
awak seorang jer pergi sebab
awak seorang jer menang ticket tu
satu ticket sahaja
awak pergi kenapa awak pergi tapi free tapi awak pergi seorang
ambil gambar ambil gambar hantar dekat whatsapp
kenapa suka romance I mean
or anything macam oh I can never forget this movie or you could have watched it like thousand of times but you're like let's watch it again
I think I like documentaries my favourite cause I like to know facts or like uh know what's going on it is seram but that's that's um
true kita ikut apa yang kita nampak
selama-lamanya satu makanan yang awak boleh pilih and makanan itu akan bersama awak sampai akhir hayat
saya ada dua choice
ya with daging kita boleh buat banyak kita boleh buat banyak uh lauk
macam have itself
okay lah awak pilih satu lepas tu kita share
kifarah like you get what you get
walaupun kita rasa kita buat banyak baik but mesti ada satu kejadian
yang awak tak akan lupa mungkin awak rasa macam oh saya tak saya nampak auntie ni
tengah crossing the road tapi saya tak tolong sebab
so awak rasa awak utamakan muka yang cantik
atau awak lebih suka cergas like you know kadang-kadang kita nak keluar kita
okay kita makeup kita get ready
tak boleh fit in our pants you know we wear shirts and we're like we have to cover up properly cause
badan sihat why any reason
you know I tak boleh masak and then when I balik kerja I macam um
ignore dia you know
biarkan dia buat kerja dia sendiri and I don't think having good looks would help with doing all those chores you know
mmhmm bila awak rasa nak makan awak makan
complete with whatever we have kita tak rasa macam
at this age um aku rasa I'm doing just nice I'm doing fine or um at this age I'm doing okay you know I'm not that bad cause I'm still working or I'm still earning you know
okay ah first kita berbual pasal regarding our hobby lah okay ah so you can first what is it your hobby
cakap lah macam okay example like kalau for me my hobbies is ah I like to read books I like to travel I like to
ah mostly spend time dengan kawan-kawan ke apa ah that is my sort of hobbies that I like
ah I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai I don't really like it
punya brand tak ada you don't have any other brand yang you suka ke apa ke
kan and I think you also suka Coach
you pun suka
ah quite lately lah I think that daripada dulu pun you memang suka Coach if not just lately
ah so apa lagi yang you
you apa you minat selain daripada bags
okay because for me ah whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore kan pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak
we apa more like
terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu kan so
important the family makan and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa it's edible lah boleh makan and there times yang you masak pada I is
uh fantastic lah it's good juga lah kan
takpe lah the more the more rounder become most to most
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore nak main bola dah susah I I try to ask my friends to play all
with sharif if the kid maybe can can be done ataupun
I think in terms kalau
ah the whole society punya makeup pun dah changed I think now we are
kalau kalau passion the thing is passion is there
budak-budak cuma only have
to ah play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is lain
kalau sekarang ni when people play is
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if macam
now like dulu kalau kita nak tengok internet pakai computer will really stay in front of the computer
tapi now even with handphone
kan contact the people pun
tak ini lah so the
itu lah the changes in in time eh so in order to survive
ah mentality zaman dulu punya kan tak nak handphone tak nak pakai
ah internet kan I think kalau sekarang ni if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
ah I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be apa terlalu ke belakang if let's say we are too far
have to have to try lah kan tu kadang-kadang when we try pun
susah juga nak nak catch up kan but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that lah kan okay sekarang nak
berbual pasal apa topic lain
kita takde lah travel banyak-banyak tempat kan ah so for our travel is mostly to
ah if not we will be like apa every year at least lah
I think bila kita pergi tu apa boleh
so hope macam apa we can
so biasa lah pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa lah
what are the ah pattern what is the perangai yang kita boleh
ah click atau tak click what is our
err kalau bawa
ah apa
ah yes lah you can ke depan lah
takda lah at least kan
ya when we first sampai the hotel tu
kan bila kita sampai
bilik tu macam okay everything go like so olden
kan ah ah so after lepas dah the bilik tu okay lah but overall
so sometimes kan you have to buy kadang-kadang macam apa
because ah dorang tak jual
so that's why kadang bila kita when
dorang beli to sell at their shop ke apa kan
nak pergi ah
itu bukan itu aja even someone who
to kasi duit
then dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua kan ah
itu lah kan so other than that
ah indonesia juga bali juga
and your dengan best friend you ah
down there pun our friend is a hindu kan
boleh tahan kan tapi dia punya
ah hotel ada sikit ulu lah
ah kan ah pendalaman
tak kotor sangat tapi to me is ah
kotor juga lah kan
ah big buses tak boleh jalan ah um
in terms sana another thing I remember pasal bali tu pasal kita apa
yang sebelah atas tu eh
gunung apa eh gunung eh
ah gunung tu it was fun lah
basically macam atas tu sejuk it's like going to genting highlands
ya cantik memang cantik but the place tempat makan tu it's like all the buildings
so I wonder ni selamat ke nak duduk sini
kan ah I remember going to the toilet pun it's like
ah like a ghost movie punya punya toilet masuk
dekat situ nampak eh toilet ni senyap jer kan tapi pasal nak kencingnya pasal kan nak kena pergi
pergi jer lah kan but luckily it's only me lah I think if he want to go
kita just duduk and talk
ah a'ah near the swimming pool there so talk dengan raja
so ah nasib baik tu satu jam eh
ah banyak juga lah topic boleh berbual takde
we don't clear all macam apa nak cakap apa we talk
ah kita apa
um ya dia datang kita punya wedding a'ah
kan kita travel dengan dia eh quite a few ah kita pergi penang dengan dia ah
banjir ah
yang bestnya pergi rumah P ramlee tu dia punya
a'ah sikit-sikit lah tak semua lah
uh huh kita respect lah
dia kawan ah P ramlee dia kawan P ramlee dia pernah hidup dengan P ramlee lah so roughly dia tahu P ramlee punya sejarah tu macam mana
jambatan bridge ah
sekali pergi ah he got fear of heights
pusing gitu jer uh huh um um
komtar penang tapi itu pun apa apa macam
ya so dorang tutup that one is the
even the penang chief minister pun ah minta tolong dengan
party kan so it's that bad lah kan tapi
memang nasib kita baik lah kita dapat pergi
but I remembered lah yang kita pergi sana tu
mana-mana kita nak pergi tanya flood ke tak flood ke tak kalau dia kata um ah longer way uh huh
so macam kalau apa even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building tu di apa
a bit macam odd lah something good
kan kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia
food museum then there is the upside down museum ada the three D three D museum ah basically is the
basically is err apa taking pictures
punya opportunity lah tapi kalau nak kata museum macam gitu
upside down museum I think dekat singapore pun dah ada upside down museum ah so nanti mungkin kan kalau with the apa
then kita boleh pergi lah upside down museum ah
ini bukan apa ini is so called macam apa lepas gian
kan nak travel tak dapat dekat singapore kita boleh lah buat aje lah
boleh enjoy ke tak itu lain cerita lah kan bab kita a'ah the fans ah our friends pun ada kat sana kadang kita travel pun kita suka bawa our friends kan ah itu lah that's the good part about apa
travelling lah kan ni dah tak travel and the thing is ah dah tak travel tu satu hal then with this COVID nineteen
a lot of restrictions tak boleh lebih daripada lima orang ke apa kan abeh kalau nak kawan pun dia empat orang
kita tiga orang dah dah lebih kita tujuh orang kan so is susah juga lah kan hopefully tengok ah hopefully the COVID nineteen punya apa
vaccine can be found nanti kita boleh go to phase three maybe phase four kan
um macam bosan juga lah kan kalau kita kita pergi mana-mana just kita kita nak mingle with other people pun susah kan
ah so that's why kalau kita keluar
kita pakai glove kita pakai mask kan ya lah pakai glove ah
ah touch anywhere kita pakai glove kan kita pakai disposable glove
kita pakai disposable mask anything disposable kita pakai lah to prevent from all these ah
bag tak boleh disposable kalau beg disposable
ah cari topik lah kan
okay for me kalau dua puluh dua puluh satu my wish is kan ah
okay lah anak kita pergi sekolah agama he is able to cope
ah then other than that ah hopefully rezeki kita bertambah lah
ah apa tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people pun move other parts of this one is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family pun move kalau kita punya situation kan and got a kid
to jaga kan to jaga we got a special needs adik to jaga kan so but okay lah I think it can be done lah it will be difficult sacrifice perlu dibuat kan cuma hope to apa
hope lagi banyak benda kita boleh
kita will work out lah kan
the vision is clear kan ah our vision is clear kan of course kalau budak susah nak faham kan
ah tapi kata orang pun kita lead we lead kan most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out kan so kalau macam
of course lah kadang ada orang selfish apa kan so if
that person selfish tak nak cooperate kan
I will do it lah tapi kalau dah tak boleh kan
kau get into masalah
kau suruh aku handle aku I feel tak
tak ini lah tak apa tak adil tak adil kan so I will always go for fairness
leher ah
yes the neck tapi macam the neck only can show where to turn
kan tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang decide nak turn atau tidak
ya kan so sebab itu kita as a keluarga we are as a unit kan so we want to move we want to move as a unit
kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini kan then kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat
affect tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah then
really have to apa explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue lah kan so the issue now is whether dapat settle ke tak
tak tahu hopefully akan dapat settle lah kan
dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal lah kan I don't want to halang
kalau dia nak kan kita akan we are
in terms of nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap lah kan
tergantung it's very susah lah then
semua dah buat kan
kan kata orang tu kan
but now the organisation bukan satu tempat
they are two different organisations so yang ini tempat check
ah masa depan
for future yang ini untuk apa
ah dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain so
whether it will improve ke tak
tak juga dia different criteria kan like example kalau macam
ah apa in order to apply for example ah to apply for need
ah certification that he is autistic then dah pergi minds minds dah certify dia dah ah settle
then after that nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula oh
certification from uh minds tak cukup
ah doctor lah doctor or hospital or what okay so pergi doctor punya hospital
happen doctor hospital tu pun ah okay lah willing to help okay he did that part
then after that bila nak apply for apa for apa cash in life for home caregiving kan oh
cannot we only we only accept those who are apa
risiko there and the the thing is
okay lah macam cakap macam macam kita ni
macam for macam untuk adik ni
I am willing to usaha kan and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support lah
so kita kena buat kan tapi macam you try imagine
kalau lah all these checks
yes correct and the thing is pula
kita pergi check up ni bukan free
everytime pergi
ah kena bayar ke apa kan but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds tolong
percuma free
ah even the hospital one happen epilepsy punya doctor kan so there is no extra charges lah and
ah so nanti Q cure ni kalau macam apa
in order dah dapat cash in life lah apa ni semua cash in life lah pula nak kena assessment kan
and then the assessment pun need another set of ah check up
kan lah so memang susah lah tapi
ya lah duit apa
kita bukan harap ah ah at least dia improve
istimewa ah uh huh
I think for him is my target for adik is apa
kan kita bukan I'm not expect bukan expect dia boleh
pandai kan macam harapkan dia apa dia dapat
he can enjoy kan of course dia punya enjoy not
macam kita macam kita enjoy oh kita nak jalan kita nak travel kan dia punya tak dia punya enjoy tu
simple something that dia suka
dia feel comfortable sudah kan
ya lah tapi kata orang tu apa ye lah cuba kalau mana tahu kalau dia improve kan
dia punya epilepsy dapat
ah which is now supposed to be terkawal ah kan tapi
tu yang payah dia lah susah dia kan um um um um
ye lah proper food um um um um
budak-budak ya
tapi orang tak tak pandang dia begitu orang treat dia macam apa
tapi tu lah macam kata orang tu apa
treat adik with respect lah walaupun dia istimewa kita make him part of us kan janganlah lebihkan orang luar
abeh anak sendiri pun treat
macam apa kan kita try to make eh dia suka apa kan
bother to find out apa yang dia suka apa yang dia tak suka
apa yang dia comfortable apa yang dia tak comfortable kan
ah bukan setakat
ah apa marah ke apa marah
kan dan dia pun tak tahu apa yang dia buat salah kan kita susah nak
nak cakap kan
mengganas ah
dia tak dengar lah ah ah
um tapi tu lah
kita cuba jer lah kan hopefully everything goes well
hopefully is a better year hopefully boleh travel
kan mungkin short trip dulu
ah bawa adik sekali
ah dapat duit banyak kan gaji
jadi kita boleh apa boleh do
banyak benda yang baik lah bermanfaat bukan sahaja untuk kita
tapi untuk orang lain sekali ah for now
tapi kan tengah COVID so macam
ah I want to try so I I want to talk about the thing that I was talking about just now but it's about someone's else conversations so macam uh K takpe

if you know how to might manage your time macam okay one day badminton then one day
gini but evolve is just
I usually run um macam about
kind of everyday but just like weekends kadang-kadang macam rest penat sangat kan
two K two K plus pun jadi seh
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know dekat um
kasi lah you know chance sikit kan tutup mata satu kan and just orh come
without any experiences in training will be provided kan boleh pe and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much ah honestly
kan susah nak dapat company yang you know really
like baca buku about homework
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
there was oh kena buat assessments lah apa lah
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian kan dah balik sekolah penat
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
for their well-being macam okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay lah kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh tau
kalau rest pun ten minute
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high ah maybe because of that you know kids complain macam eh penat you know I don't want to go student care anymore
quitting lah actually like one month macam about seven
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian kan semua benda kena
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa lah
tak telephone tak apa
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah lah I mean like but
the day I get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
macam like I don't know I I will learn from it lah
macam they will get like a set of rules
macam it's kind of unfair
macam takut tau okay you know like they say macam when you
when you buy buang air kecil kan then like there's ends
how to say macam
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
don't you takut seh say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
takut lah I mean like I have to take care of my diet lah
so I am like oh okay jap white bread is high
okay macam
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
that's the thing kuah lemak apa ah cholesterol oh my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
this is the thing ah macam
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active lah abeh busy lah dengan kerja
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit seh do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
err love pun susah dapat like
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya lah it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but I mean it's not wrong but okay lah macam
ada balance lah okay one day with your parents one day oh I've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one um student right
um makcik tinggalkan
ah abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
ah dia tinggalkan ah dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa ah
cakap um bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in macam oh ni ya allah tak baik seh
the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
ya lah they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
um doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
um lepak or relaxing at her old age
bosan seh duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
I don't know macam singapore
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut lah but then
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy wah jangan cakap ah
lepak sikit lah
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
I mean rezeki tu okay lah there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
to me macam house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid lah I've never been living with a maid before macam sedap kan ada orang kemaskan you and all that
go macam okay err go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive leh like you just take one year to just
momentum dah hilang tau hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar eh
macam shiok dah naik shiok
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
may I I graduated kirakan macam april lah eh dah habiskan
till november terus start kerja
so better lah aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
the punya
so minor I mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
oh betul betul betul
I mean depends ah on the situation kalau nak job hop just because oh you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana seh
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
oh my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
macam we are barely okay
like with so many macam experience and really capable
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam eh korang ni tak ada apa-apa ah just nothing you know
middle lah macam
that's true macam like
I always watch like movies you know macam
and macam susah lah dapat
macam america ni semua
sometimes I do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
apa ni is stranger things
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
like once I'm indulge into that kan habis
it's over for me so I tend I tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like muay thai gym
for I usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money lah so I stop playing games
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
baju ni semua but I'm trying my best not to
I see eh wait where does he where macam mana dia invest
tak sikit kan that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years ah then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
um and in case if you were to macam touch wood lah macam pass away or anything like
how to get ah macam
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
what do you mean by anak luar nikah
oh tak tak tak macam serious macam in love gitu abeh uh dorang macam eh aku nak kahwin ngan kau ah because like I know I feel like I'm ready for this marriage abeh like um you know the
the parents macam oh you too young you know why why you want to get married so young you know and then they are like no I want to get married now now now what do you think
haram lah like that
okay so it's like err kes macam err okay scenario ah it's like err
they halalkan like that ah
macam apa mm macam nak date other chicks or what
I think I think by the fourth year ah aku dah settle down sia aku dah macam damn this is long and it seems like much of a long shot see
but but to me ah by the third or fourth year ah it will give me like a sense of macam
ah that's the thing lah because of the current situation right like right now we are both schooling abeh tak stable so even if we wanted to tie the knot kita masih takde
like tak ready because of money ya
tu lah
tapi honestly speaking my parents are like scared because like we are okay both I think I can understand from both parents point of view because they like err
they don't want both of us to macam sekolah halfway sekolah halfway then after that err drop out because what pregnancy or we need money to to support ah to support each other or like err
I don't want to commit anymore sins eh and it's not that err macam bukan aku yang tanggung fully tau is like my parents around who has to tanggung for my sins also so it's like aiya I don't know lah susah I don't mind getting married now
macam I think it's kind of true you know I have a lot of
err friends yang macam ah don't want ah I I need money I need money like err aku takde duit nanti tak boleh hidup and I'm like but money is not everything what you know there there is a lot of things that accumulates to life you know ah macam entah
macam kalau kau tak ada duit kau macam hancur ah
like nobody was rushing for everything traffic was normal tak takde orang yang macam marah marah you know kat singapore macam
semua orang nak boom boom boom rush rush rush even in public transport especially in public transport semua orang macam oh alamak aku kena masuk
entah when I was still
correct eh okay lah jam is another thing in singapore because we're so small ambil macam the I don't know in singapore is so dense the popular the popular apa the population ah yes is so dense and like there's this
actually a lot of people want to err masuk singapore you know to because singapore is safe in terms of the health and all that and kita macam number one tau tip top tau
like my dad boss they actually when COVID started in singapore right they flew to spain and then after that bila spain kena dia cepat cepat balik ke singapore
macam kalau kau sakit ke apa kan ada disease siapa kau tak tahu apa-apa kau datang singapore singapore can like handle it you know
donation like that okay and then like err a lot of children from asia kind of thing dorang macam err
suburbs is like farm area macam all the rural ah ah ah like rural area like people
I remember dekat punggol macam everything must empty takde barang you know there was a a lot of land yang kita boleh pakai
and then kita macam
you know last time I err we go pancing tau
pancing dekat macam illegal places
eh aku pancing lah
err how to say ah macam hutan-hutan oh begitu kita pergi kita drive dengan kereta masuk hutan mana entah random
serious tak joke ni betul kalau ada orang dengar ni confirm dorang cakap aku pernah ni pak cik pak cik confirm tahu punya
so err I think kita pancing ah but then after that I think the government know about it lah so no choice right err they I think they close macam a lot of the places ah and then err kita the only place kita boleh pergi is
flats because population kita kan makin besar
kita ah foreigners also coming in a lot of foreign talent
then err apa singapore pun is a district for business tau kau tahu like a lot of people come here to make deals and like because it's a common ground macam
si kim jong-un datang kat singapore dengan si donald tu kan dorang datang ke sini cause we are neutral
ah aku ingat aku ingat the apa banyak macam sibuk kat shangri-la tapi semua orang macam ee I want to see liao ah that kind of thing
eh singapore ambil kesempatan eh but it's good err apanya rasa publicity
ya it was good publicity for us ya sebab wah terus semua orang macam wah tengok oi singapore lawanya shangri-la wah macam semua nak pergi kan
tapi err I err aku rasa ramai orang ada misconception especially after rich crazy apa
eh I think after that that one right so many people macam got to know about singapore kan because they mentioned in singapore banyak kali tu
but the funny thing was apparently there are rumours yang cakap rumah tu bukan kat singapore
rumah tu some of it was filmed in malaysia
okay aku tak pernah tengok sorry ah
serious no joke aku tak pernah tengok
I don't know I felt like it was just too hard cam am I right macam and it's
phua chu kang yang adik
oh betul
kan rambutnya poof
okay K K salah salah
I thought they were itu
dia memang jelaka ke dia every movie pun dia jelaka
ocean eight one is jelaka
he cute I got see him before as in like I mean like nak
alamak takde chance lah
banyak okay K
that time aku kat rumah abah aku then he say uh he ask me ah eh do you want to watch mulan or not then I say
but people say don't support mulan then but then I do want to watch lah macam
tapi I want to see if the cinematic is good or not so
so aku macam okay ah maybe just watch but I didn't really pay attention to it ah
I was not fully there but I watch macam sepuluh minit lepas tu chao
and then after that I came back I oh okay so this is the scene ah ah ah oh ni scene dia abeh apa dah jadi uh oh ya so I didn't really focus but I kind of know macam dia punya jalan cerita
ya why kau dah tengok oo on the cinema
oh apa dragon tu mushu eh
aku sedih bila mushu takde because that was that played a very important role you seh
alamak aku tak ingat [ah]
tapi it changes everything seh like the jalan cerita is not there anymore what
I remember seeing that one the the guys macam fooling around mandi
the mandi part I saw that one
ketawa sial like apa jer K but anyway then aku ingat bila
cause yang lagu dia it keeps playing that's all everytime I watch the music keep playing sia then I was like what is this leh why why the like in the real cartoon got so many songs you know everybody's happy
but then this one it's like keep playing reflection reflection reflection sini reflection sana abeh
alamak ku tak dengar
speaking of movies when was the last time you pergi cinema
kita pergi tengok cerita alamak I forget what was the movie called err
it was like err X-men punya series ah
ya macam this group of kids with super mutants ah new mutants ya
ajak aku then K lah
eh aku tengok ah sia
tak semua ah aku tahu the first one
no not the first one lah the first one is normal apa yang dorang
ah apocalypse aku tengok
back to the future dah aku tengok
aku tahu yang err
err yang the first one the first one ya normal kan the second one is the dorang balik right flashback kan the third one is
ah ah si jean tu
mm wolverine tiga ah tiga
bila semua cinema semua busak busak pula buka bila cinema buka
baru err it was one of the movies that was being released together
takde lah when no lah after COVID bah
eh after COVID eh macam COVID dah habis juga
the there's the scooby doo new movie yang macam merepek ah honestly
eh tapi yang the one that I was the the one I was so disappointed eh was a quiet place
aku macam siala
sakit hati tak dapat tengok it's not released
ya abeh dorang semua orang dah get ready ah I think it was
aku dengar bila but it was going to be released
sekali when the government announce yang the circuit breaker period kan lepas tu dorang macam sorry cancel lah ni semua ni semua and it was like a couple of weeks maybe two or three weeks
aku sedih sia I was like walao so close
tapi boring ah bila kat cinema we were separated see and we were three people
so I was like macam mana ni then kita okay lah terpaksa lah I just ask uh apa
I mean like it's okay what I just because I also don't have any interest right in this movie sorry sorry apa
okay maju cari online ah
macam okay they needed this staff to jaga the cinema halls and they needed this staff to save entry then they needed counter staff
but now they change seh they change to err counter err satu orang so the counter will take all your orders macam kau nak tiket ni you want some drinks okay uh when you pay already there's this like queueing system macam McDonald's
so apa ni
so kita tunggu lah macam McDonald's begitu
even at Timezone tu kali aku pergi
ya aku pergi Timezone
eh Timezone bes seh but anyway I went to Timezone also
ya true makan duit a lot
uh same lah like they just kesian aku tengok a lot of people do a lot work seh then macam to me it's extra work ah
oof kenapa pula
ya sia eh speaking about that and plus even if you commit such crime like that if you get caught lagi like
but ya lah I I think you brought up a good point seh like I think this second job that okay maybe if it's a side hustle yang tak take so much of your time ah then maybe can ah
macam what
like eh walao I'll be angry seh if I have no social life boleh mati sia
oi susah sia
okay the time or money eh okay kalau if let's say I am married lah
ah that's why that's why I say money is tak not so bad ah it can be a choice ah
I think being in singapore macam very I think just singapore lah ya
keeping it to macam singapore punya contexts ah
oh tu lagi ugh
although I have to say that macam uh
like that one that one can say that the government is trying to improve because err there are more ministers talking about it and macam a lot of people are more open to listening and like they don't just macam categorising as orang gila you know that kind of thing
that one rabak seh semua orang macam ah ni confirm stress jer
tak mau sensitive seh ya tapi ya lah err I think it's
have you heard of this macam disorder called multiple multiple
apa I forgot ah split personality gitu macam
gitu split is the one ya kau pernah dengar
aku pun tak tahu sia
uh okay I had actually aku tengok this YouTube video tau err this this there's this girl lah aku tak tahu ah
err then dia macam tunjuk tau macam mana dia punya
disorder macam dia punya err how like she just teach more about her itu [ah] her her macam mental health I guess
you know it's not mental health is just the disorder lah eh dia punya diagnosis ya
and then dia tunjuk tau macam mana like she changes from one person to another person that kind of thing
wow I didn't know such like wah seriously macam ee aku tak pernah nampak sial gini ya because of internet ah ya basically things from the internet eh macam exposure seh
ah ah macam recommended
yes that's the okay honestly when aku first heard of it eh I was like
what ya ya eh apa sial this is this seriously macam for real I've never heard of this sia
and I was so shocked by the err apa personalities that was in that girl you know
okay dengarnya ni alters
ya tak betul not not really tak betul but macam split kan macam banyak power
okay they will get strong tiba-tiba all that right
ah tapi tapi dia ceritakan as much as it is an exposure to this disorder it also portrays a little bit uh macam fictional of the disorder macam bilik
so ya you should watch it you know ah that girl I forget I know her YouTube is dissociate did or something like that kau tahu anthony padilla the YouTuber
anthony padilla ada ah kat YouTube ah then he he did that the interview
ya then uh he interview ah the girl then the girl show got this budak kecil inside her body eh ya then budak tu kecil tu keluar tau
as each alter has their own um role macam there's the protector
ah there's the protector there's a apa mediator there's the child and all that so
aku tak tengok movie dia actually
tapi aku tahu pasal movie dia
macam err like like those scars lah like that
macam superhero right right right they had a motive right together
uh I feel like uh apa ni the movie is good exposure lah
eh I mean is rare to to see all these kind of people like I've never met somebody in singapore ah actually tak pernah aku nampak dorang macam begini ya
mm three wishes eh okay firstly I rasa I nak jadi billionaire
jadi billionaire I feel secure
can actually solve a lot of problem macam if like in case of emergencies like
macam accident ke apa I have the money already
I can like feel rich you know like macam jalan sana jalan sini eh I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
so I want my own transport and rumah
so like what you asked right I rasa transport I nak motor ke kereta ke
I nak my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
tak payah nak tunggu flights pun
like I want to go here and there I can macam eh sembarang eh aku nak flight okay aku naik aku punya private jet that kind of thing
like also kan macam bawa orang lah like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam you know sekarang kita nak naik plane pun nak kena bayar for the air ticket right
have the private jet why not I just macam families let's go like I can
I can payung you guys for
transportation ah eh tapi duit belanja tak
I want to conquer a lot of language so macam
ada skill like that kan
like what's you skill oh I can speak a lot of language gitu macam but I want to speak like the common one lah macam mandarin uh korean it's like
common sekarang then
kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam nice right like
since it's a wish right dia macam bukan macam magic gitu kan kalau magic gitu kan
eh sudah aku nak letak magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need lah tak payah
you know about yang seratus dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
or like amusement park ah all that ada tourism
you want to picnic ke nak overnight
rather than macam
kalau dia dua ratus lebih then
you can only use your your own only kan abeh bayar seratus lebih gila
maybe we can picnic ke apa right what you said picnic then kalau kita picnic pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak
macam hotel then chalet ke apa kan untuk staycation gitu kan mm actually not bad ah I think the idea is not bad abeh kita boleh barbecue lagi kan kalau kalau kita macam
chalet ke ah kalau macam chalet tu boleh barbecue pe
and then macam rumah okay rumah maybe like macam if it's like four hundred we can just
so it's like satu orang like berapa berapa puluh dollar gitu or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars gitu
untuk makan dengan minum okay ah nice then we can just cook or we can like macam chalet or what we tempat dia boleh masak kan so
we can just buy our groceries ke apa
then we macam simpan dalam fridge then esok tu breakfast boleh masak
semua then
I think by lunch gitu we need to
because right takkan kita nak buat macam so called birthday party tak ada decoration ke apa kan
I mean we can buy macam dekat daiso ke apa kan so dua dollar dua dollar murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat neighbourhood kind of shop kan
so I'm not sure if kalau mm but it's a nice idea lah to macam
buat both
because we can macam save up a bit of money rather than macam
satu birthday party lepas tu birthday party lagi habis duit then
tu confirm confirm kena bayar lagi eh service tu
nice but I don't think macam I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own macam
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation macam like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
we should use chalet or something rather than that because macam
kalau ada rules or regulations susah ah kita pun nak buat macam we want to save
cause sekali tak save eh uh government pula
ah ya lah like some agency datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih eh
err macam
ada rooftop like that ah
not not really rooftop dia macam not rooftop or shelter tapi macam indoor sikit
ah we can we can find the place around there so kalau hujan ke apa kan kita tak kena
because marina west coast east coast tu semua is all
so kalau hujan ke apa we still boleh lepak depan situ
for a picnic with my friends we actually macam
abeh okay maybe kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita pack up sudah hujan lebat kan
because it's like alah sikit-sikit jer point point point
gitu jer kan
I mean we got the what is called ah yang besar tu parasol eh
ah yang payung besar tu
we brought that also so kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ we letak so
ah macam ada what is it macam terpercik eh is it terpercik macam hujan kena
if we macam takut hujan splash on us then we put the uh the payung besar
mm even though we under the macam cover kan but still lah we just
kita tak kena ah pasal kita letak payung besar tu
macam glamping is it dia macam wait ah
I don't think dia orang akan macam
err kau nak stay pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu I don't think
I think that's good though but rather than macam we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
err take macam morning like that no we should like macam petang petang gitu
we should rent from petang petang
sampai ke malam like that so sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu ya we should rent that kind
so that macam
but I I don't know kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu skate macam you don't know how to skate kan
abeh kalau aku roller blade sorang eh sedih sia aku orang semua cycle cycle cycle aku eh roller blade dengan aku
oh I remember that time my eh my cousin our cousin our cousin said nak pergi zoo
merepek pergi zoo pergi zoo tengok binatang jer
both of us we don't really like animals macam hey kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok jer binatang tu
maybe aku tak appreciate ah but
I seriously want that instead of macam pergi to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
gila I will just research about it later lepas tu nanti kita tengok
cause I felt like kita macam tak spend banyak time
yang macam cousins we don't really have much
I'm like I'm schooling all that macam all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to macam jalan-jalan together
we can actually macam save up a bit of money ke apa eh lepas tu pergi shopping ke
macam nice right
ya tak berapa lama kita plan eh picnic pe picnic engkau dah dua tiga tahun
I mean I don't really like the pantai but okay lah can
I mean I'm okay with it cause it looks it looks nice the one I just googled just now it looks really nice and I felt like macam
eh macam best jer tempat ah gitu
if I'm not wrong kallang ada
mm tempat stadium tu
I mean kalau hujan ke apa kau tetap boleh climb apa
sama lah aku goal tahun ni
nak healthy lifestyle
healthy ke benda jogging tidak malam siap kerja makan
oh but talking about tu you know just now eh just now mampus you know that time
I wanted to try dia punya rock climbing
cause I rasa macam eh long time seh tak rock climbing why not eh
malu ah kalau jatuh ke apa eh orang keliling nampak dah lah rock climbing dia dekat tengah-tengah dunia gitu eh
embarrassment lah lol kat kallang wave tu kan
we can also macam watch movie also dengan dia orang
eh do you do you think the one that you suggest ada ke apa boleh kita tengok cerita lepas tu
makan makan berbual berbual lepas tu lepak-lepak eh
tak payah ah buang duit ah
I thought this one dia orang dah sediakan tempat tak ke
they sediakan already right they they have their own designated punya tempat pe
so I cakap lepas tu kan like what you say lepas tu kita cycle kan so pagi-pagi boleh cycle pe
dah cycle kita pergi mcdonald's ke
ha gitu kita pergi makan breakfast because we only bring makan untuk dinner dengan yang so called small celebration tu
then morning cycle cycle tu semua beli makan breakfast tu semua then after that
if they want to play at the seawater suka hati ah kan
I thought of like I don't know if I should bring my guitar or not but then macam
chey minah melayu sangat ni if I bring guitar and then
and then you play guitar macam eh macam dalam drama eh
but nice and then we can like macam take video photos
it's either kita macam nak balik rumah ke kita macam nak continue to other place ke apa not bad ah
tak payah nasi ah merepek picnic picnic nasi nonsense
no lah but since it's picnic I already know lah takkan I nak tu buang ni
nice if kita since kita nak buat macam birthday party celebration that kind kan
we could have just bihun goreng and nasi goreng eh sedap
is it kita nak potluck gitu
kita bawa makan dia orang bawa air ah kita suruh cousin kita bawa air
ice since dia orang nearer ask them to buy ice cube also ah
huh cucuk what
gila kalau semua benda kita dua jer yang buat
ya that's why I say dengan kita dua nak buat macam macam jangan buat kelakar
you know you talk about macam letak dekat skewer gitu kan
instead of letak kat skewer tu kan then we can just buy you know yang macam selalu orang barbecue ke
orang birthday party ke apa yang besar tu
ah so we put everything kat situ
ya lah so mi dengan nasi letak dekat situ tapi yang macam nugget ke ayam ke crabstick cuma
tak payah letak belakang lah
but I think we can do macam benda lain I mean
I I thought of like macam
buat roti sandwich or
or apa eh tu nama
I mean you say macam tak nak everything fried fried what then macam tu semua I mean it's easy to do but
whatever lah I mean tengok jer lah if if I feel like doing it ya I will do it
mm actually okay ah boleh ah one one dish jer ah lepas tu kita buat yang you know
uh we buy it's either we buy or we just find yang besar gila punya tupperware tu kita buat yang
buat satu jer lah tak payah buat dua gila kata
goreng goreng ni sambal goreng pula lagi tak payah lah
boleh boleh actually not bad can
air I think air
we are going to like have birthday celebration ni semua from
today to the next day what so of course kita perlu air pe
now like that I want like macam then we half half ah macam one is the normal drinks then uh macam
half is normal drink half is err carbonated one so macam sedap ada orang nak ada air sedap
oren oren carbonated
ya because he say it's better to just buy there lepas tu pergi pe pasal murah pe belakang
boleh lah beli a bit of chips chips yang kita nak okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want ah
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that macam semua makan pe
so macam if you like macam like me
I sometimes feel macam oh without this I cannot sia I need this snack ah macam gitu eh
so so so I think that one nak kena beli sendiri ah
then mi oh I think oh ya I think we also need to ask
I don't know mi hoon goreng ke
mi goreng kuning ke okay ah anything can
I thought you cooking the nasi goreng
nasi goreng cina sedap eh
you masak nasi goreng cina tapi you campak ikan bilis
I help you potong ayam
okay lah boleh boleh ask your husband lah
dua packet untuk ramai orang memang tak cukup
tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan like that what macam bowl
okay then like that takpe kita suruh dia orang buat sandwich tapi dia macam gini
lepas tu uh the tuna
ya ya what I mean dia punya roti
roti dia kalau ada crust suruh dia orang potong crust dia
lepas tu crust dia we put inside one of the plastic and then kita boleh buat
roti gula ke apa with the crust
the crust is very easy to do what setakat
crust tu kita setakat uh letak
so that it's easier so and then you can uh apa tu masuk dalam air fryer
masuk dalam air fryer lepas tu you jadikan macam snack keras keras sikit gitu
then you can just make roti snack or you don't need to
uh apa tu you don't need to air fryer or what
ya I like mushroom ball so we buy mushroom ball and instead of fishball and then nugget dengan fried chicken right
terlebih fries nanti soggy
okay ah I think we cun cun nice already ah everything we plan is nice already so I think we can tell them
instead of the one that we want to staycation tak payah lah buang duit lah
kalau kalau glamping tu mahal sangat
kita lepak kat tepi beach tu jer
letak mat kat situ ah lepak jer kat tepi okay ah
nice plan we both of us plan is like cun already
we want to go out picnic we tell them already what so but then kita kata maybe kita should go next year
during kak nadiah punya birthday dengan sambung together with abang punya birthday
we just said that but we never say about macam kita punya surprise birthday party what so okay ah dia orang pun tak tahu
they need because I think like macam whatever they like ah or need
cause I feel macam
okay lah then that one we can bring dia punya husband or something you know or someone else or adik dia
we can bring to buy to pillih dia punya dress ke apa because
kita punya taste tak ada lah sama sangat
oh ya so I don't know if we should buy denim sebab denim mahal
so tak tahu ah kalau kita nak beli denim beli denim kalau nak beli dress beli dress
colour code untuk kita waktu kita pergi picnic yes
since kita
since kita pun nak overnight right so kita colour code dua hari ah
but tak nak black ah common
I want red actually but I felt like kalau hujan macam mana
petir guruh ke apa ow aku takut
takpe ah suruh dia pakai baju kat dalam lepas tu yang tu tak payah butang
tu I don't know ah but we can just discuss with them later since we already discuss everything
so the colour coding later we can just ask kau orang ada colour apa kita ada colour apa ah
coffee apa starbucks
cause kita dekat dengan bugis kan kita boleh pergi haji lane like haji lane okay for example yang macam kalau kau nak makan makanan melayu semua
macam zamzam ada ataupun err ah ramen stall dim sum place also that time I went ramen stall quite nice ah
sedap sia nak try ya it's apa tu okay lah
I feel like kita reserve reservation punya tempat jer ah through online aku buat
orh then kau last minute rush ah
yang tadi kau punya kawan semua ah okay
uh huh eh how come orh it's the presentation eh tadi but how come your works kena collected
mm ya correct correct correct ya you make the final uh apa tu big change ah
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect what
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like oh dia macam it's their first time seeing it ah so they will either like it or not like it ah so if it if they like it means it's good lah
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts ah aku lain kan mm uh huh
mm orh maybe macam I feel like the concept doesn't really
entah eh
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
fever and dengue dia rabak eh chronic eh but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct oh okay so only one presentation ah bagus sia
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like uh week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like uh brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita kan everyday nampak kan so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like err that one I can say uh make or break ah
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
pe processor ya entah lah that what name ya
cause last sem really it's rabak eh and I feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah eh I feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan like eden I feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak oi ah ya last term last term
mm honestly aku
mmhmm orh it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
because like honestly I thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam alamak kita geram gila ah
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class ah so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module jer kita ada for this sem for next coming sem ah satu module jer but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major ah like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot ah performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
okay what macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same what but it's still under fine arts what
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then uh from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full kan
ya so aku just have to cause my I only have to take two for my module ya huh oh my god aku four jer eh mmhmm
oh ya ya but packaging ah the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what oh design and brand strategy because honestly uh kalau kita ada tiga ni benda kan then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa eh
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern I don't know why
cause like I feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but uh honestly after that after this coming semester kan kita ada three months holiday right then me and effy thought of like kerja at any uh graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern lah
dah ada kerja what you mean okay uh huh
kerja for that really meh no lah I don't think so tu ni diploma
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya lah so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya lah the process is year two sem two lah ya lah okay so that's what I should've say girl
hmm entah eh I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
then after that like uh tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody ah
and a bit like macam
in your face tau macam company tu tak nak kau macam ouch sakit sia honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa eh
that C word I forget what is that for the ni lah budak-budak art
bukan taxi lah aduh
I mean like your course quite broad lah honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai eh kedai eh company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time eh stop it
ya so stop hais eh kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay lah this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week ah
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
hais no cause aku start kerja kan
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position I can find other retail stores to work you know it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua lah
point you know oh my god I just censored my own ya and then like I never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering I don't know I mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit I told shah about it and then I was super depressed you know what I did they don't even know what I'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like oh you can just go to the customer then I'm like oh okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
I think six hours nine eleven to six eh I just whatsapp the manager ah say like the environment is not for me uh what uh this is honestly not what I expected it lah macam this is not the position I he haven't reply but I left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually dah full this this week
tu aku nak tanya kau nak kerja picking packer ke tak no no no the packer
because just now tak ini packer packer kat dia bilang kau pack apa
toy R us actually okay eh quite good eh aku nak ni green party apa kedai dia okay dok kau tahu kan the kedai jual apa no the green party
you don't know that store dia macam miniso eh
it's okay though that kedai
what if kau kena tengok shift dia juga shift dia dengan
shift dia dengan dia punya working hours
jauh oi okay true
I don't know kalau kau nak aku boleh
kalau kau nak aku okay I don't know ah I feel like
but semalam aku ada bilang kau kan yang apa tu
yang aku screenshot lah kerja tu
mana eh
ada safe distancing ambassador eh kat sentosa eight dollar per hour jer kot
kau just uh they they what they say is that
bodoh lah kau
kau kan
entah lah everything's okay though I can say belum ah baru submission oi
tak kita tak ada kita dah tak ada ah
okay I understand I don't know ah I feel like those abeh macam general studies and all right I I don't understand macam nanti like apa kita buat then like what we dapat is like the hell
mm entah eh
eh legit ah makan ramen stall aku nak try ni ah ball
tu apa bukan tu boat noodle ramen stall is the japanese punya ni sebelah dim sum punya ni kat haji lane
macam aku nak tunjuk aku tengah record
a'ah eh betul juga eh
but then I don't want to spend so much today eh aku dah tak ada duit I spent but tipo honestly is berapa eh berapa dollar ah
allowance for this month and then kalau aku tak kerja aku tak ada duit kalau dah habis
oh my god don't say aku punya printing jer one time printing fifty five dollar eh I have to print my uh board I have to print my
apa tu photo book
ya because our now is like macam
apa tu macam buku ah kirakan
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my and ya they uh then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah exactly so I'm like exactly then uh effy is quite mad ya
effy dia sot lah tak aku example it's like really unfair ah I don't know why but it's just the school lah I can say
you show macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing lah but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
eh kau suka pergi hiking tak
tak aku macam nak pergi hiking
aku dah lama mana tak pergi hiking abeh one time aku kat abeh macam mana
entah lah
not every ah ya can say ya macam friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo ah so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like I don't know ah at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but uh the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct mm the thing I like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature oi he's your age ya
then like I don't know ah dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka I semua ke apa in our relationship anytime tau kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go lah kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work lah ya so it's like very matured thing ah at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
ya really a lot until we I think he um apa eh I call kan dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other lah
but then macam um during the period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better ah
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday sia then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
and like pejam celik pejam celik aku next month dah one year dengan dia dok
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya tu masih suka eh aku masih uh kerja kat seh baru baru oh my gosh then now dah nak one year it's quite fast eh really really fast

you know like it's pointless if we keep advising but they don't really ya honestly aku tak kisah kalau dia tak nak ikut ke tak because it's usually up to the person lah but at least consider of what I say lah or like try to say it in a way whereby kau kau akan kena you know or like just reflect prepare you ya ya so it's like you are not you are not actually hearing what I said ya
what again I thought they have been bestie again daripada dulu sampai sekarang
I don't know the ex I feel like dia pun very um manipulative ya very manipulative
but sayang kau kena tengok lah situation kau macam mana I feel like khine is easily
ya and kena advantage
oh my god how is she huh really ah dah kurus eh no I'm just asking a question don't take it as a bad thing bro K I understand why but I mean okay I agree to that actually daripada dulu pe you don't realise it ah kaki dia memang kecil pe
tak ke no legit legit legit mm
ya lah it's just the makeover you know entah lah
kau jangan merepek lah kau aku pun tak tahu kadang-kadang keluar kadang-kadang turun balik I'm not in a constant mood aku dah malas already
no it's not about that dengan shah aku memang tak kisah
cause aku tak pakai makeup uh aku pakai makeup aku pakai makeup that time kan dia cakap
uh you tak mahu pakai makeup ah asal
uh tak ah tak ada apa-apa then like apa dia ni berbual then aku aku that time insecure gila ah cause aku tak pakai makeup aku dah penat gila then dia cakap
tak payah makeup makeup dah lawa then aku macam okay ah ya but actually I don't know cause aku dah biasa pakai makeup so it's like a routine lah so once you tak pakai makeup it's like shit ya so ya that's me ah but honestly
entah eh because seeing back me and year one right I actually
aku year two kan legit oi macam no effort
time aku pakai makeup pun pergi luar jer mm ya aku pun dah malas
then like entah eh
apa tu dressing up and all when you're school is how many hours jer
entah ah exactly that's that's the thing
ya ya because I feel like it's very macam entah eh you feel like shit mm makeup everything ya I agree I agree because like you don't you don't want to be the
macam the sad looking person amongst all the pretty girls ah penat ah kadang-kadang
aku dengan kawan aku yang perempuan perempuan pun semua pakai makeup lawa-lawa then aku macam alamak then nanti you stress on your own oh shit what am I supposed to wear oh my god what am I supposed to actually same
but usually at some point aku dah malas gila aku pakai aku punya baseball jersey dengan aku punya jeans dah abeh orang pakai kasut kan semua lawa-lawa aku pakai slipper oi
legit eh dah malas ah mm
then eh busy punya
ya sometimes no heck care lah ya that time pun birthday party kawan aku wah I find it wah really pointless it was last week uh after I send shah then uh dress code K me being a person where I wear black and white everyday cause I'm a very monochrome person right
my friend err the dress code is warm tones alamak ya lah but then all the tu apa yang skirt tu aku dah tak boleh muat oi tu year one aku kecil sia aku sekarang dah gemuk oi legit I walk away a lot when I was with shah cause we eat a lot ya then after that aku macam alamak
I wore white t-shirt eh white uh long sleeve dengan yang skirt tu apa tu yang shawl hitam ya so it was okay
then terus aku macam alamak nak pakai apa eh tengok aku punya closet tinggal satu baju white apa warm tones kan warna brown tapi it's not really brown it's brownish yellow abeh semua stripes stripes ada warna putih then aku macam alamak pakai jer lah and then I
err for me it's like err macam very
masai ah
not aunty lah but masai ah macam entah ah selekeh ah then after that aku jumpa kawan-kawan aku semua tak ikut dress code lepas tu dia orang cakap dia orang tak ada then aku macam abeh semua pakai baju top warna putih abeh seluar hitam then aku macam bro I could've just wore that seh abeh kawan aku yang perempuan lagi pakai hitam
aku dah macam girl at the birthday party right is only the family yang pakai warm tones then aku just macam I'm like what so ya orh it's actually merepek ah oh tu pun aku dah tak boleh muat eh skirt tu ya I want to I don't know where that skirt go already or ya kita pergi museum pe cause that time ada yang mm neon light that one kind ya sekarang dah boring ah neon light
you know I don't uh she told me that she don't like but I feel that she like him dah lama cause girl
ya and then dia cakap aku ada bilang kau kan yang dia orang pergi club together and all oh my god
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu jer eh aku cakap gitu
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which I find it macam a bit irritating ah
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy jer walaupun the other girls kan dia orang satu clique err like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik ah aku punya orang is
even though I have three err I'm always like with that one friend I will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam eh nelly nelly so aku macam okay ah then like um that that one group of girls semua okay lah dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay ah
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur ah
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam hey how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
err nadhirah eh uh huh khine ya dia suka
tahu pasal huh how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal lah eh macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard ah kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh I feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa khine kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat pe but he's like for me it's like I don't know eh
ya and I put the line already eh you know and I find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam hey khine mm okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam hey girl then aku macam aku terus khine then after that ah that time aku masih in my in my clique ah aku nampak dia kat err apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam hey girl then wear tudung tau
then semua orang tengok aku tau then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other ah then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect ah like um macam dia kan handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam err confirm everyone macam oh I want to be the one that is hugging I don't know lah kadang-kadang I find it macam a bit merepek ah
hmm entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik ah aku macam gitu but then once I heard kau hello I'm anna I'm twenty one from girl be my friend
because everyone is very young eh at that point then I'm like huh ya that's why it's like entah ah but the the reason why I was close with shaz first because I was the only one that talk to her during that general ya class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq err aku just nak cari classmate aku ah macam kawan daripada class aku kan at least ah aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out jer then aku just hi uh like what class you from oh I from uh one that time kita punya class apa one G eh honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one G
oh girl same class then kita just all the way together ah plus from there aku tanya dia like
uh why you not rapat with the other girl semua like our class semua okay aku cakap gitu ah macam all about the worried about the class thingy
okay so I she's going away we're going to get her a present ah and ya I think you're right the frames are too heavy we're not going to give those but how I don't want it to be like macam buku yang just print out like that biarkan gitu then it's just gonna sit in a cupboard forever I feel like it will be cool if it was something that she
can see everyday you know especially in that country maybe lots of pictures of us in the sunshine macam while she freezing her butt off there
yes yes yes yes ya ya ya so it's not just err err apa tu what we going to make
err phone phone case it can be anything it can be a mug it can be a t-shirt boleh apa-apa kan
but no you want a gift that can on that day itself be looked at right okay okay fine ya ya then I think ya we can find some small light items nak buat dia punya print ah so we're gotta select a bunch of pictures of what we like right and then
figure out what are the things I'm sure they have online presence mesti ada kalau kau pergi dia punya website dia cakap that these are the things you can bring on or something ah or if not actually there are a lot of websites that do that so macam vista print
cause they are that kind of digital printers so they do everything so okay so let's pick out a bunch of pictures kita pilih mana yang kita suka then that becomes the photo book and then we pick out a few others ya okay can ah I guess that is the plan
aku tak ada tak ada bilik tau bilik aku is my sister you know so cause I was living elsewhere so my things were always a minimum ah and then both times when I go government staycation also
again I lost a lot of things so my whole life has been a series of losing shit lah moving and macam just all over the place so when it meant that when I moved into this house I just didn't have
why can't it not be us apa jer okay so how about we make a poster ah of us
when forever in your heart you know sort of vibes ah ya ya it's ultimate narcissism for a group that is so in love with ourselves gitu
what is the deal dia secretive gila ah sia aku tak tahu dia sekarang at which point you know are their tickets booked is that is what is happening over there you know
sharing about it like that time I I thought her her attitude was interesting like she was dia cakap that um
she don't want to talk about it to people cause she's afraid to like jinx it gitu and then she would also feel very embarrassed if she was supposed to leave on a certain date and then didn't then people will like macam
eh nisa why you never leave eh kau apa sia I'm like can't imagine who the who the hell would actually do that to her
tak aku rasa it is that ya ya ya when it comes to him you're right they got some secretive things aku aku rasa that dia cakap dengan nisa that these things kau tak payah share dengan kau punya friends I think so too I think that is that sort of understanding between them which
ya lah it's their partners lah we should respect that ah but I just thought there was some fear there you know of people mocking her and I'm like um you a bit too old to have this fear tapi dia kadang-kadang got got that kind of little streaks of like
how to be her own person ah like she will stand up to people and she will I liked it when I see her at parties and she very mother hen with all the younger ones I think it allows her to make a lot of friends cause she goes in like a kakak kakak you know she goes in like
ah kau dah okay tak and then aku boleh cakap dengan kau gini gini gitu gitu like like she's just how are you macam mana sekarang sekolah gitu gini you know and ya
ya I I don't understand what it could take macam ah ya unless somebody changes drastically and that could happened sometimes somebody becomes bitter or alcoholic you get what I mean ah then you become a bit wonky ah
ya both both both to tini okay got it okay so she felt like somehow you macam take tini
together apa kau orang semua sama-sama tu ah
so abeh at that point kau tak cakap apa-apa dengan dia
abeh kau tak terasa nak cakap apa-apa dengan dia cause kau dah tahu kan ah
ah dengan tini
siapa jas dengan tini asal eh dia orang macam
so hari tu bila kita dah sampai dekat pizza cause again I'm lost in my own world did they have a chat outside dia orang berbual
ya ya ya ya ya ya unless you're coming to eat with us then okay lah it's clear tapi kau
iya lah like like like you like to
ya okay okay okay ya ya ya nobody really likes that anyway ya ya ya yup ya ya ya I understand tahu
jadi kau bila kau berbual dengan sarah kau adalah explain dengan dia that the reason why that even came up in the first place was pasal kau nak understand make tini understand that she's being played ah
did did we post that picture in the group chat with dengan dia punya cake nama dia tu ah K K
tahu tahu tahu ya ya ya ya kau percayalah ya I know I know I know I know I know I know ya
ah correct correct it's new information for someone you know as opposed to macam mengeluh over somebody usual pattern tu lain
ya tak tahu seh cerita cerita ni semuanya
ya tu lah tu lah
then I also wonder oh is it because we just don't say these things kita mana nak belajar pasal boundary and learn how to do it
ah ah correct aku rasa macam
tu lah tu lah kami datang nak petik bunga di taman awak
ya it's the bahasa berbunga and the gentleness of the language overall lah ya ya ya makes it hard
I bet you would have kau mesti ketawa macam perempuan gila in the corner and make it a lot worse than it is nanti dia fikir aku betul-betul suan dia
confirm tau kau punya sense of humour kadang-kadang like no janganlah
ah so azmi tahu ah hari ini kau datang sini buat ni ah kau cakap dengan dia
kita tengah we are currently in about let me see twenty seven minutes we are about halfway through ah azmi can you entertain yourself
ya I did say no background noise but that was just a really quick one kami minta maaf iya
ah or maybe I do I don't know I have to go in and check that might be some ground ginger from my mum she likes this she gives me ground ginger so I could mix it with some hot water and and something okay I'll go look at it after this actually I'm getting damn hungry so after this I do aku nak pergi makan
aku nak makan mak aku punya briyani tak kisah pergi mampus dengan perut aku and come and taste some a bit sedap makan dia dengan curry all these
mak aku masak two days ago national day feasts
ah tu ah tu pun ada I didn't even know we had this tradition tapi tak pasal-pasal ah hari ni national day kita ada briyani abeh aku is not not having it so that day I was out at brunch then after brunch went over to to aman friends place right so I was
ya do you know there was my national day was so non eventful on my way to brunch which I had with a friend dekat at kat upper thomson aku pass by dekat road aku nampak banyak-banyak orang semua diri dekat luar road
then aku thought they were going somewhere but no cause it's this mobile columns that's moving right so that's why I did not know about this mobile columns at all so I was like why are they just standing there kalau kau nak pergi somewhere jalan ah asal diri sana panas terik tu hari tu aku dengar forty one degrees
apa ni you're supposed to kill people that's what the war machine is for right but ah no but apart from that I had no idea it was national day I didn't even hear fireworks can you see from here
jadi sekarang macam mana kau nak try tackle one of the questions
folklore and petua-petua kesihatan you get what I mean for like different ah different food items whether it's different types of herbs different types of leaves different types of yams whatever from indonesia
the waiter comes out and the presentation is beautiful the way he like opens up the kau tahu macam bunga-bunga apa tu eh bunga ulam eh or is it the bunga-bunga macam
look like banana flower kind of vibe ah or top ginger you know that kind where you sort of peel it open kan ah lepas tu the way yang dia orang serve and like plate the thing and then telling the explanation of what it's for and how do people use it are there any stories associated with it I thought that was a really memorable meal cause everything that you taste suddenly had a lot of significance and I'm sure we all had meals like that and I think whenever somebody plans meal kan
ah tu
bila larut malam punya vibes ah
ya ya ya actually I don't even know about I feel like I've got aku pernah dengar nama dia saffron tapi aku tak tahu kat mana dia kat bugis
where is it tampines ah okay okay okay ya lah maybe that's why aku tak travel out lah
it's very random and it goes straight to tampines I don't even know why normally the road ni kira ada feeder bus jer biasanya tapi sekarang ada one two seven apa benda
and I've been seeing a lot more of this large bright green buses punya bus baru punya ah ah dia orang macam tak tahu ni bus baru ke service baru but
ah new buses lah right that they bought ya ya ya ya so from tadi yang aku faham bus ni kalau kalau kalau kau ambil bus ni dia terus pergi highway
do not pass do not collect two hundred dollars dia terus pergi highway lepas tu kau end up in tampines in berapa minute okay lah not minute lah but iya lah you get the idea ya ya very short ah
but they take awhile they all take awhile they will go and explore kat mana kita pergi tengok-tengok err geylang mari lah kita boleh tengok katong
mm katong ya there's a lot of ah detours ah tak faham seh
ah ask bird park pun bird park aku sakit hati aku ambil bus pergi sana one and half hour sia
pantat kering ah that I basically aku need to sampai boon lay
ah bird park kau kau cakap apa zoo eh
dia orang masih tak email aku sia after aku hantar resume aku about that was I think on the seventh
dia dia cakap they didn't basically dia macam portal gitu kau upload upload resume apa benda then at the end it just had a your resume has been successfully submitted ah ah kau tunggu three weeks
then the meantime there are other things like my I have a friend who call me and it's basically what this is is a startup habis startup ni dia macam kumpul together all the plumbers electricians sort of thing okay then you would it works like a uber where you would find a service and book it and then abeh kau kau boleh tengok dia punya err err route to you ah macam macam macam grab delivery ah boleh nampak dia punya driver on the way to you how long more it will take blah blah blah
and then ah they need somebody to help coordinate this things in the back end and also err check out on the services that is provided tanya lah dengan orang tu okay okay tak dia orang buat ada apa-apa rosak ada apa-apa okay complain ke apa benda um
so that's that the job seems rather interesting tapi I'm I'm a little concerned about it on a couple of levels ah firstly dia startup abeh baru start apa apa cerita dia sebenarnya you know like what is the process and is it kau orang ada macam any or template in place or actually kau orang tengah cari orang untuk start the whole thing up you know from scratch properly cause if that's the case ya okay I I also don't have problem with that but I would need to make sure that I'm paid
there are already a lot of websites where you can even like directories and you can kau boleh filter down tau kau tinggal kat mana orang ni kat mana ah that kind of thing it's not something new ah this
pulling together of different house jobs you know plumbing ah carpentry little bit that sort of thing it really exists a lot jadi aku macam err apa seh
nak try ke tak
abeh in the meantime ada benda macam gini okay aku happy nak buat I don't know why sia I don't know ah I'm feeling macam don't want to work and then also the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and there's all this weirdness and more jobs to be lost and the economy is going to shit
it's not a way of avoiding the world it's just aku don't feel like dealing with you all right now it's too much crap I don't feel like it I'm not having it
leave ah I learn this new word vibing I'm just vibing man so kira macam tangkap jer ah vibing so I vibe ah
ah ah ah betul
betul betul betul and just live a simple basic life for awhile right ya
ya ya I would get into something quite obsessively I think you know like just explore or pursue or an interest sampai
ya ya ya the whole thing is a very romance novel vibe yes ya with the hair and the jawline it's very like the guys that you find on the cover of romance novel gitu ah
tu ah abeh macam kau terasa ah kau terasa macam kau nak extra mentel gitu tak tahu dari mana punya ni ah
that's also a romance novel apa macam the rope who you tame taming the rope
pangkeng means apa eh
oh tu tu yang kau orang panggil hotel ah rumah uncle
tak tahu seh
kau kau bayangkan hidup mesti ada concept
kau bayangkan ada cakap dengan kau hidup mesti ada concept computer programme
eh kau
kira macam gang ah ah ah ah ah
alah geramnya it's like asking your parents kita sebenarnya asal dari kampung mana seh
mm mm mm mm mm budak marsiling
okay kau boleh nampak malaysia tapi sana tak ada causeway tak ada apa kan there's no bridge
toa payoh aku rasa mungkin ada port
alah sedih
aku macam >pakai file tak pakai file pun dia orang tak kisah seh
ah ah betul
I I went to this activist event ah some time ago two years ago I think it's called apa itu activist so it was mainly organized by AWARE and a lot of other like MARUAH all this ah different activists and groups here in singapore then one of it had breakup session so then you can pick
which room you want to go to participate in which session ah so I went to this one particular room where dia orang macam mana tau macam lebih kurang tiga puluh orang tiga puluh orang sit in a circle berdiri in a circle
and then berdiri in a circle lepas tu the person yang moderator diri dekat tengah dia cakap okay if you have these things that I'm about to say you step back
if you don't if you never had these things then you step forward so they started asking ah kau ada maid tak kau pernah ada maid rumah kau abeh kalau kau ada kau step back
so abeh ask more questions ah macam kau pernah ada rumah family kau ada kereta tak kau orang pernah pergi holiday kau pernah rasa macam snow basically questions about privilege ah then at the end of the thirty forty questions that he asked
kau boleh nampak ah siapa yang kat tengah siapa yang kat belakang sikit abeh yang kat tengah banyak was a lot of brown people also cause some of the questions that was asked was also macam have have anybody made fun of your name
abeh aku found myself right in the middle with two other people
I was a bit confused about being in the middle cause I thought I ada pretty good life you know ya we got no maid no car all these tapi there's always food on the table I had uniforms I've heard so many other stories of people who had it so much worse right that was interesting but then
dia semua pun ada abeh kenapa orang lain tak boleh ada ni semua kenapa hidup dia orang nak kena sampai macam gini seh
couldn't he just kept crying and crying the group macam went around him abeh sayang sayang dia and
betul betul betul aku ada terfikir tau at that moment macam eh kau yang nangis sepatutnya aku yang patut nangis apa sia kau nangis tapi aku rasa tapi aku rasa kadang-kadang
tu ah ya ya correct correct there was a sense of that there's definitely a sense of that but then there was also a sense of maybe you need to
like be far removed from the from the situation in order to sympathize with it sometimes when you are too close in the situation dia macam apa tak kisah ah buat jer ah
tapi when you are far away you realised actually this person doesn't need to do this you know this person should be able to have other options instead of being forced to towards doing X Y Z so maybe he was in the better position to to understand privilege than we do cause he's
I don't know I don't know what it is ah about us like you said maybe it's that change over from technology that's change and suddenly from a position of being macam a bit suaku about the world suddenly we see a lot more we see a lot more riches we also see a lot more pain and poverty
eh aku tak suka ah dia orang punya cerita tak habis-habis tak habis-habis pasal aku dulu ah very very poor tau aku tak ada duit family aku tak ada duit
main soccer
macam are you listening to yourself not bro
ah kau tak ada script ke ni sikit-sikit ah
ya ya ya ya ya ya and who's writing this maybe the people writing it are tone deaf in the first place you understand like aku can imagine them choosing some like rich fuck
oh this is the whampoa ya but cause kau orang punya the other side siapa lim tian
lim tian sama dengan randolf ah
randolf was volunteering with lim tian apa
it's for people who are scared lah it does need they need to be told that cause even this election banyak kali sia macam naomi had colleagues my mother had friends who all said your vote is not secret in singapore
this fear is still there ah and aku rasa the the the likes this fear to be there cause then senang apa untuk dia orang
ah kau try ah nanti aku tak kasih kau covered walkways kau nak covered walkways
but now I see my apa I was specially recognised as a top fan
it's a facebook group ya ya ya I was so proud of myself aku macam I took a screenshot and send to naomi and say my accomplishment for today everybody we must achieve something
hidup mesti ada concept
okay I'm actually very stress lah pasal the my wedding lah
that was the initial plan err tapi entah the situation can change you kno
err kalau we we I moved to his house kan at least nak pindah to our new house it's lagi dekat lah I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the barang</malay
mm then don't know lah to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house eh and then like rohana because kesian kan the the the budak macam</malay
tak kan nak share satu bilik perempuan lelaki unless they are willing to build err bunk bed lah which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed err we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed cuma share bilik saja</malay
so I thinking kalau if we move to my parents house the
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least ada bilik and the house is bigger then dia pun dia pun cakap like oh ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
ah itu dia macam takut not really takut lah like you know too dah biasa tinggal kat east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding tapi due to budget lah kan um
maybe consider to do two separate size lah so cuma no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be leceh you know because we have to tak kan I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
aiya ya just basically just a bit susah lah
yes but then tak semestinya we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider macam like like what mother cakap is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
oh that one I didn't check err because the only thing that I check was that if let's say um we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate ke tak</malay
ah because err I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong lah six months atau three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like dulu lah s
entah but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then um one thing about the the is florida kasi ready ready like err provide the flooring err basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare lah
err tapi I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply ah it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so err tak sangka that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan oh uh wedding macam mana err how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the saudara mara dah besar besar how about lik
the budak the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is satu famil
ah okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part eh for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year dah kena deposit you know o
ah okay but then I mean ya lah whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows sekarang pun is about the same tapi we do have like thoughts abou
memang okay memang we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
kita buat kat bawah block ya let's say for my side ah
I kita buat kat bawah block you have to consider that oh catering and decoration may not be under one err one company we may be separate and then err apa ni like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one err price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like macam you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
mak andam all this separate lik
for me I think like oh because kita buat combine and it is a location that can provide a lot macam for the one at orchard righ
and if you want kompang then that one is different thing lah then the only thing that I have to worry about is um the ride
uh the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because kalau boleh I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know lah my dad punya thinking i
you know that budget right make it a small nikah and then just makan makan lah after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know lah my father got problem so and lagi pun</malay
good wedding ah is really really great lah so macam entah jus
okay ah if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him lah because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the duit hantaran and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs err to ferry to each other to each side lah so at least kalau macam at one locatio
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like kalau buat two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit kan susah and then kesian the mak andam kadang kadang I'm not thinking for myself lah I am thinking for other people so y
that's why lah is really really hard for me to think about this lagi lagi two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there lah from now lah
I mean I get it lah you told me to work on it tapi the problem is I have been discussing like
parents lah all about these tapi I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
kita banyak discuss within each other its tapi entah lah when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then macam</malay
okay okay boleh okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum uh his mum atau she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least alah dah biasa makeup sendiri is best to you know biar orang kat orang makeup kan orang kan lagi pun</malay
ya the mak andam dia punya at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already lah eh the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just tutup one eye lah for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and lagi pun</malay
uh tapi kahwin sekarang
itu pun okay no doubt her big plans changed ah but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the um th
planner is helping lah so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make bawah block lah
but because now really very hard right so the err dia parents cakap okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels lah
so her concern is that eh bento box mana cukup like is a malay wedding tau you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento macam is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that lah but then because of this eh err she had actually got enough as i
ya of course lah you too just want the nikah but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see ah lagi alah I think because the his mother also macam</malay
alah mak pak dia dah tua so he she's been trying to push him to get married lah so I don't know whether that means that oh just cepat cepat kahwin then dah or just want to make it a big even
because lah ya lah like you mention that I'm still considered an uh outside outsider kan so I mean kalau boleh I don't want to masuk campur lah whatever happens because it's not my family ye
tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana I mean kalau boleh I tak nak masuk campur bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what ah sebab ini pun ya at this time pun is good lah to get married cuma</malay
definitely lah now you kan confirm ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean tak yah by choice lah but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if kata that err you want to invite a certain family member tapi sangat jauh actually like four hours is like already long lah kan
kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput kan family jauh tu jauh lah tapi tetap i
jauh in the sense of distance lah not is in terms of family tree so macam like there was one example that my friend she just got married like uh think two months ag
err)she was apologising to ah semua like ah sorry ya tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak limit kat family jer then we all macam trying to reassure lah tak apa lah kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom lah I mean no issue what tapi ya tapi you all are like my like my friends and also macam I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam kalau boleh jangan lama lama kan don't delay right but then alah since they actually tuhan dah dah tau eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind lah just get ready lah but err but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still kat rumah so limited to I think fifty person right termasuk her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like macam sedih because only family is there ah no friend so macam like entah lah I don't know lah whether she still feels bad or not uh so she's been trying to like you come lah you come over to my house lah we will have lik
makan makan session or something but then of course due to schedule lah we cannot commit to certain times right y
because we are considered err sekarang first time righ
ya like like okay lah you can like still had ya know tu I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also lah and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as dah bilang the parents then at least bila the both sides nak jumpa to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor yang for him is the duit hantaran actually until now I don't know the difference oh duit hantaran and mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's kalau macam untuk pasal wedding ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin that one is okay is i
and then for hantaran that one is considered lik
no no no not the barang hantaran but duit</malay
cheque kosong dah melampau kot actually kalau let's sa
maybe because of all these uh hantaran right I didn't actually eh one post kat Facebook um this err is like a page lah where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like macam those magazin
got married um in iBloom apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded lah drag until like baru baru juga lah and then um bagaimana tahu that the husband have a lot of hutang</malay
on top of the wedding tau because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because dah kenal lama</malay
sejak dulu so they they feel that okay lah since dah kenal lama kan and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage ah so maybe because it'
err macam it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that kan dorang kena ada hutang and then some more at the same time dorang nak dapat rumah which I don't know how lah so macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that dia macam stress like dia yang perlu kahwin tapi you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like err bukan apa ni bukan</malay
err loan daripada along lah its like those err school punya fees then dia minta bank loan for study he eh from what I read leh he the husband did investment so investment hilang duit</malay
so because dia tak boleh bayar I don't know lah all this thing I I don't understand lah so so she's like was asking pendapat lah like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so macam to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing sama kan
ah against her or citing her so those yang against her right are like macam you kno
a lot of people macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it lah
tak kisah lah sayang ke kenal lama ke because I've had err friends eh who actually tunang urgent dating lama tunang about two years tapi ended they didn't managed to go throug
wah that means either like they are not ready financially atau just dah tak ada feeling lagi lah which saya macam pelik eh like you tahan for so long as in not say tahan lah dating for so long and the bila tunang you just give up ah
ya lah a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because dia nak minta pendapat eh
correct but then entah lah I feel like but then to me kan kalau going back to my friend eh um together for seven year
and then tunang for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got dugaan when they tunang tapi I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so apa beza ya when you sarung cincin then oh suddenly all the problems come up you kno
so macam that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that oh okay ah lepas ni uh nak fikirkan tinggal mana uh nak duduk mana but it's the fact that oh it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already tapi kan the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding eh is lik
the lauk is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
err if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of lauk</malay
uh the other one is like the basic lah got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like kuih muih ah it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
he close bridal tahu then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else oh ya we can offer you th
kambing golek for about I think uh fifty people or the we'll issue uh like one thousand satay stick
uh as in uh part of the bridal right that means is uh tak salah it's two outfi
two outfit and then with mak andam everything he compared with the price of kambing and satay
who would wanted seh and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person tahu and they even dare to say you know err because you know lah perangai kita after every wedding mesti will lik
this one tahu they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event lah we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe pukul enam ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me oh
so you want to stay as long as you want tak kisah do you know padahal both of them ar
kirakan muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies lah basically so macam it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better tapi the
eh so dah okay eh
tak lah nama nama samaran ke apa tak tahu
masih oh okay okay boleh boleh okay good
so apa apa safian buat dekat dia
a'ah nama dia siapa

that statement melayu tak setia is it by your friend punya experiences or what
then your friends punya experience

mana tahu you ada kawan perempuan lepas tu dia break hari-hari pula every month
so your friend is the one yang yang wah player sia playboy

aku ada aku sentiasa ada untuk kau oh plot twist oi
apa A&W
okay what if like what what what if like someone confess to you that that she got a crush on you ada
makan kat mana mcdonald
boleh lah tapi macam you guys are still schooling itu semua macam it's a bit too ex for you guys
mm safian dah graduate then now you are in
so got like at least macam basic pay lah I don't know how much then
err habis tu perempuan ni okay this girl like like interested in you tapi dia pun nak pergi high class how will you react
okay what if like macam perempuan ni macam okay lah she she nice tu semua macam dia dia cantik cute apa tu semua okay you like her tu semua
dia punya attitude just
how would you react ataupun dia macam dia dia dia kaki kikis dia macam mesti macam everytime
everytime dia dia cakap macam nak keluar kan mesti kena pergi high class punya tu serious ah
tak what what what if like tak dia punya personality semua bagus okay dia punya attitude but ah baik bukan sucks attitude dia bagus tu semua and all that then dia macam
is like a dream girl macam you know she got everything itu semua
tapi kan
macam she just want to go out with you macam high class restaurant tu semua lepas tu bila kau orang keluar kan tak boleh kena hujan tak boleh kena panas
tak boleh public transport kena grab
tak tak tak tak I want to check the timing so you will like to like to list down pula oh lagi sepuluh minit so you will like rather go out with someone who is like average looking apa tu semua
kalau control macam macam
oh macam dia cheat lah that kind of thing
okay but then again if if someone ada niat untuk cheat right
anything any possible mean and way they can do it ya so macam it doesn't mean on the look macam sometimes dia macam boleh macam
even sometimes macam okay lah I got I got hear and and see before with my own eyes macam muka dia macam biasa jer tau still can cheat
I don't know I don't know how lah but then like is is just possible anything is possible also ya so I guess at the end of the day it's just niat dengan hati
jap eh
mm ha apa apa apa okay okay okay sorry I cannot multitask lah okay apa ada perasaan
ah ah macam confess ah
okay for girls right sometimes we like to jual mahal like me legit legit so
tak lah I mean like macam ya it's just a phrase like macam
okay then then in order to know if like she is really not interested in you ataupun like like nak jual mahal right you just continue talking to her if she still like continue talking to you right
macam like a few months later then like tengok ah your your chemistry with this person lepas tu try to macam go out with dia tu semua
tapi jangan jangan cakap lagi yang you interested in her so macam if you guys macam rasa macam there's a chemistry between you guys there's like something going on with you guys right
ya lah I mean like I mean okay because you already told her that you are interested in her then she said she's not interested in you what betul tak so so you already accepted accepted that then that's macam for you for you now you think that she treat you as a friend jer so in order to proceed to the next level tanya dia what do you what she see
macam itu because some girls are like just just not interested lah gitu
tapi kalau dia macam fickle minded macam one moment the she she treat you as a err more than friend macam you know macam
more than friend ah macam gitu
cakap no lah we are just friend apa tu semua
yes tu pun fifty fifty ah
sometimes some sometimes girls also dia orang just take advantage of guys macam dia orang cannot cannot be lonely
apa seh berbual pasal tu tapi tengok map wah you search for her ah

fickle minded siak perempuan ni

tak apa lah mungkin tak ada jodoh ke
god promise you to give you err reward you something macam something better
ya when the time is right is your turn gitu eh
okay lagi two minute
ya nak
mm ya nak ada lagi nak
best ah berbual dengan safian satu jam ni
kita kita kalau buat podcast kan kita selalu senyap
you know zuhairi dengan
siapa tu nama dia hafidz
dia orang berbual for like ya dia punya podcast okay dah habis
okay bye dah
baik baik how are you
ya my husband want me to jaga anak-anak and don't want me to work wah so good right my husband
oh wah like that leceh lah
then masak for my husband and kids then ya I feel safer for that lah
aiya tanggungjawab mah tak apa lah boleh
eh batuk-batuk pula
five days is so long imagine you sakit then after that you kena five days
eh tapi
you pernah kena sakit ke
tak ada special queue ke untuk kita
ah tengok lah bila my husband on leave cause ke sebab sekarang kan december holiday kan
ya that's true so sebab tu lah then government baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan
oh go lah I see like ada staycation then um holiday then I saw my friend kat facebook lah dia tulis dia cakap dia
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars ke you see lah I haven't got the chance to redeem it
ya lor tapi complain cakap yang ini mahal lah
because staycation is known to everyone that memang mahal but I think
government dah kasih duit tu is good enough
hais susah lah I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
malaysia sepatutnya kasih singaporean masuk I think january but I think sebab case dia orang tiba-tiba naik I don't think it will come that fast lah
the I think the quality got a bit better tapi the inside you can actually put the filter
then the dia punya outer layer yang kena mulut tu is actually very silky so I tak sure lah benda tu really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
ya tapi surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
oh yang apa tu makan dekat seoul garden ke apa tu eh
oh my that one to bring like what the whole family macam reunion dinner
ya lah but tapi orang-orang ni pun kena lah jaga apa um the
jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok lah asyik lupa jer apa nak cakap
um jaga
whatever the government say kena ikut but the problem is I think kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three pun masih belum ada apa-apa so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
ya talking about parents kan my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out lah sebab
tapi the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
mm lagi kat got orchard then now what dia orang punya christmas period I think tak ada lah mesti orang-orang ni mesti still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
you know banyak malaysian kerja kat sini kan
they don't have any place to sleep over at uh singapore sekarang
ya lah that's true tapi at least dia orang come up with some um apa tu nama dia solution for the malaysian lah I heard that they give um
oh eh you think ah the people who come to singapore yang malaysia yang
dia orang nak hantar barang you know like those barang-barang kita mostly datang dari malaysia pe
like the sayur like all those foods lah you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
mm eh you remember or not yang masa the first time yang COVID nineteen ni um keluar at news then they were asking for people to be yang swabbers
eh you have any friends working for that or not sebab dia orang tak train kan
wah but I think most of these people yang
jadi swabbers ni maybe dia orang kehilangan kerja kan
then apa dia wear those um protective gear
wah leceh juga eh but I really pity those yang
kena berhenti kerja then they have like what two three anak to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what um home
hmm I think also um government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know lah some of us ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time sebab
like losing their mask so sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids tapi of course it's a added cost lah imagine sekarang berapa fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal tau
macam mana tu very expensive to have a surgical mask
eh so you don't have plans ah for the december tak ambil leave ke maybe plan outing with your family ke
sebab iya lah special day kan mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan
but tu lah COVID lah restricted
betul lah for me pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang kan so for me my family kita nak pergi staycation
kesian budak-budak kan dia orang
okay selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu um then birthday cake then kalau saya time
bulan puasa tu saya sempat lah buat kuih raya untuk orang yang order tapi saya buat untuk small scale jer lah kan sebab government pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk family friends only
kalau masak usually I will just cook uh whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like mi bandung um nasi lemak you know those normal stuff sampai tak tahu nak masak apa
betul juga um before this I realised that after the
tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu deprive others lah untuk beli makan tambahan then you imagine if let's say gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya
ya tapi mana lah orang ni nak ikut undang-undang so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest lah
ah ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid
semua sekarang online
doing the delivery like grab apa lagi eh deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
so I think people with uh young kids sepatutnya maybe could just do something else lah
eh kita ni asyik cakap pasal government aje dah lah kita cakap pasal makanan pula lah mm I'm hungry already do you want to eat
uh eh I saw like they have uh kentang
with kentang then yourself is
but by having this kind of high tech technology eh you see for older generation yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
cause you imagine orang-orang tua lagi they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh you know do the normal stuff like even going down
keluar to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage lah not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us lah orang-orang muda macam kita
at this point you how do I say eh macam
mm betul
mm betul tu
tapi saya rasa kalau um mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar
then expose diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin inshallah dia orang boleh buat
mm betul tu
mm tak apa lah awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli handphone yang
mungkin boleh guna handphone yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada handphone ace samsung ace saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya lah
tapi saya rasa pun di rumah orang tua not much of um they don't have internet access so that's why nak kena beli line which is also an added cost
sebab mereka tak use internet ah data as much as us kan kalau kita facebook instagram baca news uh semua lah
tapi masalahnya saya tak rasa macam awak cakap tak ramai lah yang mempelajari barang-barang baru seperti ini
mm mungkin
ya tapi saya rasa mungkin lama lagi kot
dengan malaysia begitu indonesia dan ingat tak hong-kong baru-baru ni dia orang nak buka hong-kong balik tapi tak jadi sebab ada about other infection case
ya oh cakap pasal ni saya teringat tentang
saya rasa dia orang pun tak ada bazar lah
sedih kan
tapi saya rasa kalau bila dah fasa ketiga dia orang in naikkan number of people to lapan
saya tidak tahu macam mana sebab saya rasa penat juga duduk di singapore sahaja
mm keluar especially bangkok kan
tak apa lah saya rasa saya nak buat staycation nanti
betul juga tapi tu lah staycation in singapore very expensive but it's okay end of the year
tidak risau dan also um
tu macam safe safe apa tu saya tak nampak lah
oh dah macam police ya mereka
wah dia orang dah pusing sini berapa kali
mm apa tugasan mereka yang patut mereka buat kerana saya rasa
tak ada benda yang mereka harus report then
a bit of waste manpower pula
ah oh ya baru saya ingat yang masa period tu
ada berapa video yang keluar pasal auntie uncle kat luar
mm then ada yang tak nak pakai mask susah lah nak nasihatkan orang
okay lah cuma kesian kat orang berbaju merah ni apa nama dia lagi
tapi yang um rasanya ada baju mereka tu ada yang letak mungkin
saya okay jer ah tengok tu dia tengah bebual dengan pakcik tu
pakcik tu tak pakai mask lah
sekejap ya saya check dalam app
eh rabak army life is the most

is like whenever I see someone else tengah pakai tiktok kan especially the lambang kan
nanti lagu dia is lagu sama keeps repeating
and then nanti like someone will just say
eh nak pakai tiktok pakai earpiece ah diam ah irritating ah
ya ya ya but youtube you can find what you want to find itu yang bagus dia
basically I want to start a new instagram punya account ah
tak tahu asal lah but like instagram more revealing is is quite a thing ah people like really follow they find inspiration from it and
dia got his client's straight from instagram
like they asked for mister grab even though dia tak
mana lah tahu that that photoshop punya skills semua kan photography skill kan I can use to to take ah couple photos with my girlfriend

instagram is apa famous
okay and then tiba your news feed is like filled with
fitness punya benda eh
outliers macam jujimufu
yang photographer pakai lah
at the subject punya nak ambil gambar tu and then when you raise your hand to block the light kan dia tak ada macam harsh shadows when you cover your hand nanti the the shadow is like very soft
so is like photography level punya lighting is like one on top satu dekat atas satu dekat belakang

and then need to buy memory card lagi susah leceh
macam ah
S twenty ultra ada

macam you tak tahu photoshop
pasal you were saying it macam is like really hard like time consuming is not really

it's just lepak ah
I don't know why doesn't make sense but they say that it's just housekeeping lah so like the another company that moving another battalion right they have to clean imbang ah
our the place that we stay the area all macam hardcore everything

ah lah but we all friends sia we don't need I mean we don't mengira sia
but if me I also don't care if pecah too bad ah cause I don't want that say can what it's not
if a stranger pecah kan I'll be angry ah if fail pecah kan
I don't know he's not that err bad feeling ah just like alamak dah nak buat apa
entah tu pasal lah
ya tapi dia macam tak dia lain sikit ah bro
entah same siol
lepak sia actually tak tengok band whatever
tu ah
actually next week he can lepak this weekend but this weekend I go sungei buloh sia sungei buloh is when ah I go saturday eh eh saturday
I go sungei buloh on saturday siao ajak him go sungei buloh
apa sial duduk rumah
pikiran sia like that time
I think after aku belah then start rabak gila ah
ya I heard macam korang banyak stop kan
tapi kau gila babi sia kau punya willpower
tak boleh susah
oh gila babi ah why is that eight o'clock ah
kau relax relax tapi banyak orang dah start jalan-jalan kan
oh macam over avert over exert
pengsan ah
ah dia nak jalan pergi mana pula aduh
eh gila
oh ya dia cakap dia kesian dia nampak kau hantar sekali ah siol
they start in punggol punggol waterfront mall tu you walk
ya then campur east coast
tak lah less ah ya
oh ya I heard park connector kan lebih kurang
okay uh ya dia bukan friday sebab friday shafie dia kena
pergi sekolah so dia kata
uh kalau dia dah penat
dia tak enjoy so he wants
dia tak ada eh ada
tapi shafie nak involve
ya lah memang si june
tak payah mark sebab dia tak ada
oh over there got itu apa Marybrown
affaf punya bukan dua lagi tu
si affaf boleh lah because her
uh the other two they don't need to go pun
knowing si apa knowing si
dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak ogi
kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh if we go out I keep saying to the kids
it's just nice eight eight person the children saja
I mean if you don't want to leceh then just do it at home lah kat rumah kak ogi
one you contact kak ogi
then what what she say lah then after that baru
cause I think for us kita yang tak jumpa aisyah dengan
si kecil tu at least kak ogi jumpa juga lah once and then ayah tu jumpa kan
bila raya lah
think raya haji tak salah
eh buat juga lah
macam okay so it depends
uh because sekarang ni yang paling ramai is either mahir or amin
kan kat rumah yang paling ramai so we either go to mahir's house or amin's house
kalau si lina dia happy kat rumah amin ah because it's more apa orang tu tak ada kucing
tak so ertinya we cannot come one time pun it's just macam contoh lah eh
so kita bawa mak dengan si matin
pergi rumah amin so kita lapan orang lah kita jumpa amin dengan budak-budak tu kan
ah then second group could be andir dengan si mahir
bawa the children ah
ah eh eh tapi andir dengan si mahir dah tak boleh eh
tak boleh eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why kalau nak jumpa kena macam
so contoh contoh eh
then uh maybe mahir send his kids but dah berapa
seven plus uh si kecil tu akil akif
anak amin kat rumah dia so already join in lah
ah adoi ya lah but if nak have a cousin gathering then can
get together before ini I think maybe okay lah tapi kalau let say it is um
so uh apa all the cousins meet one time
then okay balik
tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu okay kalau macam gitu
anak-anak saudara jer
so they can't sit together pun I mean they won't sit together pun
correct kalau dekat rumah amin ada lah dia orang bermain
so to me biar anak-anak saudara ni semua all the children can come down at one time
mm asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit
kita biar budak-budak semua pergi amin you handle the kids
kita uh adults alright bye bye kita go for our
so and then andir selalu kan tu
so it's not like ini lah it's the together ramai-ramai yang tak ada
so one of my suggestion is that lah uh let the kids all kumpul kat rumah si amin so at least the kids
once you step out the house tak boleh
okay other than that then they all meet at tu their ayah teh house
ayah teh will be very happy all come come come
abang is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
how and what else can we do with mama
then we ajak mak
that weekend ah the christmas weekend twenty six ke twenty seven
so if let's say you want to pergi pun boleh pakai wheelchair kat situ
jewel kan dia ada all those uh tours right
ada waterfall lah
the the apa the atas tu ada the the apa
tak ada lah dia ada cakap apa semalam wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
dia ada dia punya own timing
not today is tomorrow kakak dia ajak tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want memang he already say he uh a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
ya that's why that's why I say so lepas ni she have to go to apa ni
because I cakap dengan dia
that lecturer yang quite good lah she talk to him quite a bit
if you he teach at these two uni dua-dua uni dia ajar
murdoch ah dengan northumbria so dia ajar
so dia kata memang kat northumbria
whereas dekat murdoch
you dah buat all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
err coursework lah another apa testing test
no she already memang in this line
dia dah memang buat communication so she can
officers came into the class and dah explain pun everything tapi uh
even that wira guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go lah
uh adult already cuma I don't know in terms of
and then now they tell us dah tak ada uh two time
all ah all of the ni ya
ya lah so for example the other time dia pergi M
tu actually not bad and I saw the programme pun macam bagus tau dia ada sound recording space
mana kawan dia atau overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up lah and say okay go maybe australia ke mana
practise apa maksudnya
that's why okay another option is tengok dekat malaysia
because malaysia pun banyak twinning programme
and twinning programme dia pun not bad quite good
anak ustaz ah
ah so actually we just limit it to singapore cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil kaplan
so with that diploma kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain
one more year tapi it's just one more year ya lah
tapi ya lah dia at the end of the day apa
budak ni nak buat shafie mati-mati nak buat photography right he wants to be a photographer
shafie dia once he is focused on
so that part is good lah he kalau betul-betul interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
bukan yang dia she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like huh apa kejadah ni so she apply K
uh anak tiga ke apa tak tahu she is she used to teach in preschool
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can macam
ya lah I mean that is not the whole idea pun the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so kalau let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources pun
you you go and pause ke apa
no lah tak you tekan the other side oh my god oh my god okay
oh he he message he say kak I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
but if if if cannot get the numbers itu yang ini kan
session tu yang I told ira ira kalau let's say parents datang they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session ah I cakap
because you can still do the assessment on the first day dia datang tu you can do
tapi kalau let's say dia
so dia accept dia P three still have to give the
if ya so on the first day dia datang
dia buat the assessment dulu that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so ira angguk-angguk don't whether she faham ke she agree ke will do ke tak tahu
I cakap dengan dia print the progress report do the apa
so that tomorrow we print out semua all one time lah so that's why I want to know what is it
I don't know eh to me macam it's okay lah you just print out pun okay black and white apa
don't have to turun you have to pass to the children
uh final apa the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi on in june
uh Kumon pun cakap the same thing
so he the new centre yang dia nak run uh a franchise tu
okay so he has been teaching when he was in um school dulu dia mengajar
uh part time part time lah macam uh he take up one or two uh students that kind of thing
ah banking dia banking so he was already working in
so kena lay-off
okay dia dia
but he has always been doing tuition macam his part time lah and all
orang serani so he he used that word you know he say saya orang serani he say like that I was like ah
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can macam
entah eh no nama dia chen kang eh
tu lah I have to ask the children how to sebut nama dia so is ya
see the it uh the indian lady pun okay
then kita ada two more options lah ya
and then we can also work on apa kata orang tu
nisa kan dia cakap dia cuma nak ambil kalau suami dia punya cuti falls on ni
we're talking about the cake jadi asal dengan cake tadi
ya I saw the picture then after that you terus tukar daripada gambar jadi message from gambar then it become a message that is where saya macam
so that that was the part when I actually eh ah you ask you ask me cake because you didn't mention macaron lagi so it was just cake
but I I didn't know the the macaron was choose a'ah sebab tu saya tanya
but she didn't say what oh it's a mix eh macaron dia mix colour jer ah
is it oh you can choose different like I I I I don't eat macarons always so saya a bit lost
tapi flavour no no no awak macam banyak-banyak flavour does it incur cost ataupun sama jer harga
oh okay I thought macam
oh it's not like semua satu satu satu macam err what you call it alternate macam selang-seli ah tak eh okay okay
mana dapat contact
orh abeh dia punya review is good
so the cake tak sedap ah
abeh the thing is kita tak boleh try dulu ke abeh macam gini a bit
oh by right kita boleh datang and taste correct so kalau kalau kita order sikit dia tak they don't sell macam kek tu a small portion that we can buy and taste
inshaa allah lah takde apa-apa lah can lah
so that is cake that is done dah habis
huh I don't apa yang two hour frame err saya tak faham
two hour time frame I think in advanced for them to get there I think oh okay I think I saya rasa they need to get there dorang nak kena stack up nak kena susun they need two hours for it to get ready so that means dalam macam they need to be there by six or something like that by seven they need to do the susun ah that's why they need two hours just in case tak it's a buffer time
okay ah I I could be right betul saya rasa ada chance betul
but because usually cake tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu they need to susun letak and then they macam ah tu lah a'ah ah mmhmm
cause I saw the message your mum macam nanti letak something decoration or something like that apa tu dia nak apa
dia nak apa your mum nak suruh macam jangan plain gitu ah so ada ada decoration
biar lah by the way tadi nabil call call you first eh dia call you first is it
oh okay K K K K so I think I think dia macam terperanjat ah I think oh I haven't answer their question so dia call saya saya dia cakap actually I talked to hakimmah oh then I macam eh asal dia call saya tak sempat ya tak kari instant tu kira baru letak baru letak dia message saya tak sempat nak message dia dah dah reply awak pun dah keep asking questions terus saya macam eh okay wait
tak awak terus tak awak terus ah terus you mmhmm ah correct ah correct mmhmm so dia terus err awak terus reply balik tak sempat saya nak baru nak type kira uh okay I was about to type sekali awak terus dah uh I didn't I don't know the answer it's like oh okay I was I was about to tell you yang he mention uh okay this is what he said to me lah dia cakap
I don't know I tak sempat
then you told your mum to delete atau dia just dia paiseh tak I think what nabil is trying to accommodate dia dia cakap yang macam orang tak makan macam those who are working for the wedding they will try to put as crew uh huh that's what he said lah that's why kalau apa-apa
so anyway yang tadi dia cakap err dia kata kalau I think I think the ambassador tanya ke apa he say just tell them they are part of the crew jer he will also say lah they part of the crew that's what he told me mm so kira it's like macam we have to be on the same page ah dia cakap gitu jer
oh ah okay I thought she gonna ask question I I I was wondering apasal I didn't save your mum's number tadi saya tengah macam terfikir ni siapa I it's either I it's a the the the boss atau your mum so I was looking at it okay you added it then that number belongs to your mum I should save it
so cepat that was very fast I think she she posted lama eh maybe I was saya yang lambat lah
oh ya homework besok besok besok besok besok I besok saya ada site then sekejap jer pukul tiga ah then after that dah boleh insha allah pasal besok I
ya we can do like this also on friday ke
to dia punya problem friday friday should be okay I think
tu ah
pasal belum confirm pe pasal kalau awak dah pilih that means saya pilih jer I think you go with your mum first
mm once dah confirm
oh jadi nanti next time kalau tidak bila saya datang pun dia nak kena okay tak dia tapi dia ada intention to go any other places tak lepas tu
tak ah kita
tak payah lah kita keep to the minimum kalau saya ikut begum jer settle
ah let your mum choose lah takpe
tadi dia datang ah dia datang petang pe lambat terus a'ah dia daripada site so dia datang dia datang terus dia cakap eh uh hakimmah hakimmah minta aku favour tolong terus saya I just senyum jer ah tanya tolong apa jadi emcee eh a'ah seh aku the last time jadi emcee was poly time seh dia cakap gitu ah that's what he said
I just say like macam takde lah apa yang susah sangat engkau cuma cakap okay sekarang sudah mah that's why saya cakap senang jer kau announce macam sekarang sudah masuk waktu azan dah lepas tu kau cakap okay sekarang kita nak akad nikah ah boleh ramai-ramai duduk gitu jer bukan kau suruh suruh berbual-bual interact takde I told him no you don't have to do that you just need to talk bila benda dia nak jadi kau bilang just inform jadi orang macam uh takpe takpe takpe takpe aku nak berbual pasal hakimmah ngan kau I macam merepek you know lah him you know lah him he always likes to macam kacau-kacau takpe takpe aku ada aku
a'ah dia abeh dia kata aku make sure hafiz S pun kena get involved I don't know biar biar jangan lepas tu then he said jangan jangan dia menggigil sudah
tapi I think yang yang yang pasal sound system I don't know they allow us to touch or not sometimes ada orang tak pasal dia dia ya sometimes they they don't allow you to touch you know
usually they don't allow to touch ah tapi kalau kita tahu
I think provided kalau takde event before that that means we can come early tau macam pasal slot before us is kosong uh
so okay lah maybe macam cake semua boleh set up siang kalau kalau let's say uh grab time
syafiq dengan rahmat um kalau ada kereta boleh lah dorang tengokkan kalau tak siapa lagi seh tengok rahmat is a actually syafiq dengan rahmat boleh lah syafiq boleh ambil awak atau rahmat can just stay there
ya but the plan is sekarang kakak cakap amirul will take care dengan bapa semua jadi itu part so kita kita focus on our side jer
that's why I think I set up saya pakai kat situ juga so that means
tu lah okay
boleh lah as in kita I don't know how is the rule I don't know macam mana kan semua
ya lah correct that means baru saya datang from home kat situ pula ya ya ya a'ah
so that means I tak macam gini tau you can pakai baju kat situ tau eh actually dah boleh pakai baju makeup yang pakai kat sana
makeup oh kira dah kat sana juga eh like that
kalau kalau tidak I I don't know for my side ada pak andam ke tidak ah ataupun pakai macam mana pakaian so kalau tidak
it's that atau I get is isn't it groom
from what I know eh kadang tak ada pak andam uh usually they will show mungkin kalau kalau groom tu nanti they will show the groom atau someone who's gonna be close to me how to wear it kalau dia boleh catch up boleh pick up then tak payah so after that dia pakaikan kalau tidak then that means nak kena get kakak punya kawan tu ah yang siapa I don't know georgie ke sofian I think that that's the name something like that that guy boleh buat dia memang a'ah
eh uh kalau rizal ada
eh uh kalau rizal ada okay ah tak the thing is dia nak kena ada orang yang tahu kalau ada orang tahu senang kalau takde nanti eh macam mana nak pakai ah pasal dia nak kena ikat
tak tahu I think tak lah actually the best tapi the best is belajar dulu
tak the thing is you need to teach who kalau teach sendiri saya boleh buat sendiri it's simple as that tapi dia nak kena pin kan ikat kan
that's why just just need to learn jer everything on YouTube most sekarang correct
oh malay dance ajar ikat kain eh
okay anyway tadi kita tulis
tak actually dia simple jer dia ikatkan sekejap jer dia ikatkan tu jer tak payah pegang apa-apa dia ikat tu dah then I can go off already I don't know nak kena pakai makeup I don't need to wear makeup pe kan
ada orang macam eh touch up touch up okay wait sabar are you going to put inai
lelaki tak payah lah tak perlu kalau tak nak boleh
what do you think saya kalau boleh tak payah lah inai tapi ah ya I I I just don't want to nanti

okay maybe maybe kita kasi dorang makan I think pun tak makan lama pun setengah twenty minutes then after that orang kasi makan macam twenty minutes kita pun makan kita makan orang makan jadi kita semua makan ah jadi jadi ya lah that's why I say kita makan dorang makan dah makan terus ambil gambar ambil gambar baru kita potong kek last last part macam gitu

standard lah qasidah-qasidah relax relax I think before that saya saya actually tengah tunggu nak maghrib tu saya saya nak tunggu maghrib tu saya nak suruh ustaz hakeem err kalau ustaz hakeem datang ah I just want him to recite a few qasidah tengah tunggu recite qasidah tapi takut dia paiseh dia sorang mm mm
a'ah sebelum nikah so sambil sambil tunggu tu qasidah sikit baca doa tapi boleh ah I think can do doa selamat while waiting pasal nanti bukan doa selamat ah baca zikir ustaz hakeem memang sorang pun dia power tapi kalau ustaz hakeem pegang mic tak kesah dulu dia okay tapi selalunya ustaz hakeem kalau pegang mic ah wahab dah start godeh board that's what I know kalau ustaz hakeem masuk jer dia godeh board
mm tak usually kalau kalau wahab dah godeh board correct correct usually wahab kalau godeh board dia will do as in general jer enough kalau uh ustaz hakeem dia adakan echo lah but it takes a while pe to get it kita tengok macam mana lah tapi
usually I think ustaz boleh baca qasidah sikit ke atau berzikir I think actually okay usually he likes to do that lah it would be nice jadi tak nervous sangat aku terima nikahnya aku terima nikah
firdaus hari-hari seh sekarang jumpa aku jumpa like he keep saying aku terima aku terima dia keep saying dia dia pasal dia nya dah nak dekat
tak dia tak stressful dia kata just sekarang ingat jer ah macam main-main main-main ah just main-main the with the thing jadi bila on the day dah macam kat lidah pe just hujung hujung aku terima nikah nama nama nama dengannya okay pasal that's how you practise you just keep saying it as in as in it's normal lama lama terus okay like that

okay okay kalau kalau kalau betul your mum nak beli do your own ada time tak kalau kalau
tak pasal kelmarin kakak already told me yang dia tu pernah buat I saw yang dulang kakak punya ah dorang they
is it I don't know kita tak I don't know
kita belum discuss pe pasal dulang
ya takpe lah tu that one can discuss later lah for this one
jap eh
oh ya know not yang firdaus punya venue he said he told me eh aku venue yes dia buat tiga ratus
pasal ah tapi dia cakap fifty by fifty that's why I said saya cakap kita punya tak boleh dia kata pasal shah ibrahim was daring enough to
ya lah fifty at one time so that means somehow pasal I think most of the venue don't want to take the risk fifty fifty fifty pun still the same people pe keep coming kan so I think most venue don't want they just do fifty jer so I think shah ibrahim somehow
but but because that time tak silap saya dia cakap adik eh mak dia pergi maknya firdaus ni went for the wedding one of the cousin wedding it already happening lah shah ibrahim allow macam said ah uh the mum saw dia punya invite is I think about a few hundred so ada orang ambassador eh no I think orang or ambassador is down there to uh overlook kat depan ah he standing in front ah ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct I think that's I think that's how he managed to convince them ah as in okay you can see at how we provide lah I think that's the procedure macam gitu
dia datang mmhmm mmhmm tapi memang
itu I told him I saya tanya firdaus dah habis kau pak saudara-mara kau pun yang jaga tak [ah] I think he will
dia pakai mesin tu pe remember that thing
abeh kita nak kena kita nak kena submit name eh
for us to make ah because we know oh no pasal kita tahu pe who are our guests dah itu jer
fifty people okay lah considered as our guest list ah but for us also our part is to just record lah nama kalau apa-apa jadi pun just pump kasi nama jer correct who are coming we just record itu ah itu jer correct
no of course not siapa nak subscribe
that's why then asal tak pakai awak punya
I know I remember but just I was I was doing I was writing down something dah
tripod small tripod stand small tau very small kecil punya kecil betul-betul kecil for the cam ah kan ada dia ada yang
use the same wi-fi to sync I don't know need to try I I I need to google I need to do a bit of research I don't know need to check cause from what I saw yesterday was using but then probably boleh pakai on by wi-fi kalau by wi-fi that means boleh gerak orang just hold dekat jer anyway it's really small kecil gila so it's easy ah to hold it kalau tidak orang pakai chest pack ah
tak pasal you have to face it have to face that's why dia punya screen face us macam very awkward awkward lah you have to see yourself I don't want
that now but like abeh laptop dia the thing is the laptop is big you have to keep shifting around orang leceh seh nak pegang kalau benda tu kecil dia boleh pegang pakai tangan and then just turn left right turn left right jer which is more better rather than you shift the whole screen every time just to adjust angle
work from home and then besok I got one site pukul tiga
tak ah sekejap jer pergi site
saya saya pergi site survey that's it takde pergi office
ya lah about one hour nya tempat pasal ni bukan really pasal dia macam just resurvey kita dah ada barang tu just need to shift it somewhere a proper location like in another location ah mm mmhmm
ya ya should be sempat lah it cannot be that long
sama macam fajr juga I think it's just a stage where
tak pasal tangan mak kakak I think tangan terus pump jadi tahu I think you can never spare the kid
mm tapi bukan
I think bukan pukul sampai sakit pukul just to ah
ah even even even macam just just to macam sepak pakai tangan pun macam just like that just dia tahu dia eh kena jadi dia tahu eh sakit okay so stop a'ah lah mm bukan sampai lah dera banting takde lah not like that
anyway tadi yang the video I send to you was too long
oh that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good lah it it gives macam ustaz tu used to I went I used to went for his classes last time
ustaz madarrus he used to be in singapore now he's I think at mmhmm mm so I went for his classes last time ada cerita juga lah cerita dia so anyway he's quite good honestly kalau tanya saya baik so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing ah and then he he agree to it lah and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be macam have a leadership have leadership ah responsibility like old people dorang kan ada responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay ah simply put I also understand ah dia cakap macam nowadays err parents okay macam dia cakap parents usually perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan very strict semua tak boleh ya dia macam partly part
exactly pasal dorang apply to girls that's why tu dia cakap and then
mm then yang itu that's the problem pasal I think believe dulu orang kampung macam macam mana pun nanti kalau orang-orang lama pun ah nanti macam mana pun they will still start teaching the boys to tak responsibility kau nak kena jaga adik kau macam gitu
macam wah bagus pe kau bagus macam the the the biasness eh biasness
tak tahu ah I think sekarang happening to us is the modern and then we are too exposed dengan
ya lah western it's come from western that's why dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki they they they become matured faster pasal the dad I I think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things ah macam it the mother also play a role dia kata macam not to strike not strike fear tau macam to gain respect for macam the mother hold the status of the father macam make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father macam respect tau yes pasal dia cakap macam
mm abeh yes dia kata macam dulu orang cakap bapa balik jer tak payah bapa cakap balik nampak bapa balik takde tunggu straightaway masuk rumah punya bapa tak payah tenung pun dia step tak nampak jer automatically come home you know pasal automatically the father have this respect already abeh macam the mum dia kata hold this status macam okay ni bapa kau punya cawan kau jangan pegang macam ini pinggan bapa kau punya kau jangan makan dari bapa kau punya pinggan macam the mother so dia macam keep dia gitu tau so dia kata the father is the leader of the family and the mother is the leader of the household and children macam gitu so but overall it's still the father ah so dia kata nowadays even the father lack that macam I don't know what happened lah but then dia kata the fathers just lack lack
abeh dia kata yes ah tu ah he was talking about that also that was that one thing also
then then he said then he also mentioned mentioned this thing ah men have ego and men always wanted to be needed faham kan wants to be needed
yes that's the thing perempuan asyik I want I'm independent dia kata tak boleh the the rule of a man is to be needed kalau kau take away that he's not needed dia a very yes that's one thing ataupun dia punya ego mati nanti dia terus macam abeh dia kata that's why a lot people fall into depression pasal guy not needed women are independent dia cakap gitu that that's the tapi it's a this is the theory ah
dia kata ya
dia kata tak the thing is macam dia dia kata ada there was this one person who came up to me ustaz I'm married I have children and then I I don't have a problem but the main problem is my husband dia cakap gitu so actually I can earn my own money but I don't need him but I don't know why I'm married lepas tu ustaz tak boleh cakap apa-apa I don't know why I'm married macam I think it's just pasal no the thing is she is a woman tak bukan tak sayang I think over time dia ada children dia busy kerja they live too long together you get tired of the guy get tired of the guy something like that
okay wait kalau you have a kids that means you separate from your kids ah just the two of
the bond ah the bond together ah macam have adventures ah
develop again ah oh ya rekindle ah kira ada semangat membara balik
tak okay eh I think it's easy to say the thing is it's easy to say tau but then kalau awak tengok eh the context of singapore in the context of singapore susah you see eh sekarang jer to survive some you you look at the household lelaki bini nak kena
activity lah a'ah ya correct tak payah spend money ya just to macam cycling I can yes yes mmhmm mm

a'ah lah tapi
tapi macam macam firuz mm macam firuz he likes to solat macam firuz is see so far lah firuz and amira like to solat jemaah so I think they don't want to solat sendiri-sendiri so which is good also lah

oh my god aku bukan dia jer aku yang yang ni
yang eh ya aku nak bercakap dengan kau this uh ada orang satu message aku ni she wants to buy the wholesale ah
for yang baju-baju baby ah baby
aku tak tahu aku tak tanya nama aku just kasi tu aku cakap harga
tapi ni dia baru update aku apa dia nak esok baru aku layan ah
not Su Mamat just now my tudung boss was asking me also nak aku nak combine dengan dia ke tak buat this um baju lah
yang apa ni yang style uh uh I mean combine dengan dia punya tudung plus baju aku lah dia ingat aku buat sorang so she can combine tapi aku cakap aku ada partner lah she okay lah since kau dah ada partner susah nak combine kan
pasal ni dia nak buat macam untuk reseller reseller sekali dia macam aku ada reseller gitu
ah cuma aku combine dengan dia makna kita keluar modal sama-sama lah
tapi in a bigger tu lah aku cakap dengan dia ah aku ada partner but kalau dia nak wholesale macam biasa lah aku apa but wholesale with the other rest yang I always um you know introduce with lah
oh dia suka yang tunic ah yang tunic and the knit and the slip top dia suka sangat cause the slip top is very comfortable right
ya so she love it so much she wants to belanja again so I was saying to her lah if you want to for your your ni wholesale I will take the same price as whatever I give lah
yang same price with every wholesaler lah
mm ah kau tahu aku mark up a bit only what she she said maybe not the time yet lah
ah ya lah cause dia ingat aku sorang
oh tak dia dia
dia ada duit cuma dia ingat nak nak collaborate pasal dress and baju dia macam tak berapa apa into it sangat kau faham tak
ah dia macam pernah try tapi tak berapa berjaya lah
tapi aku cakap aku ada partner kan so aku cakap kalau benda lain like maybe kalau aku nak combine dengan dia macam things like I'm not selling like jeans ke apa maybe I can go for that lah you get what I mean or not pasal ada sisters sisters yang lain pun they wanted to combine lah together something that is not I think like right now there's a lot of sellers who are selling this dresses and all that stuff right
um I suruh dia ah boss aku tu ah
how much is it ah babe how much is it how much per kotak
for harga harga for retail is it retail price is it
cause they don't want ah they want to be the same on par with the Malaysian punya apa orang kata commission
so maybe they are earning about two ringgit or per box or maybe four ringgit per box so Singapore also they will put that kind of price lah tak lebih sangat commission daripada you know Malaysian punya counterpart lah you know kalau tak jadi macam perbualan kan competition like that
dia nya size tu not even one palm
budak-budak makan tak cukup seh
mmhmm it's a healthier choice of uh air batu Malaysia kan
about four thousand three yes four thousand three hundred friend aku nya page aku nya page ada about uh six hundred
aku nya personal aku ada
two thousand over friend personal jer eh and then aku punya page aku ada two hundred
over lah two hundred forty four baru ah okay because it's a new page but
hello how many is my viewers aiyo like berapa less than dua puluh orang huh
I don't know lah what but then aku still bersyukur lah you know even though in on live memang tak tak banyak sales but after live off live is like orang will find me to ask lah you know is there any stocks
ah yes yes you know Nina Sazali pernah uh buat kan she show all her piles of dead buyers you know
ya cause dia dia punya she showed ah
it's been like two months now I'm still having like less than twenty viewers and that day yang si cousin aku tu first time live jer daripada shop yang tu jer dah macam
ada banyak juga terjual ah abaya dia dia buat abaya is like thirty eight dollars you know the abaya
aku tak I didn't watch uh I didn't watch the punya live sampai habis cause aku pun malas kan
ah aku memang I'm very moody ah on that last week I was very moody ah I was not on the what is it called on the I don't know I'm I was feeling down I was feeling down last week I don't know maybe cause of that negative punya experience you know
and then and then we had Aminah Muslim punya experience and then cousin aku punya campur aduk with the abaya stuff
ya the last yang four hundred dollars three hundred seventy seven some sort like that
she ya still got balance the last balance was three hundred over lah nak dekat four hundred so that was from her mother-in-law at last ah macam she like I don't know ah I I feel like she's like gali lubang apa tutup lubang eh abeh gali lagi
maybe ah babe you know what the the the punya tu is registered under her husband name of course lah mother-in-law dia tolong seh
and bo pian cause this one is a big money seh but I think eh dia dah scam orang lain dulu tau but I don't know lah aku try to search in Facebook about her background whatever kan so far nobody viral her you know why
kita punya barang or not you get what I mean or not
this thing will be like very sampai satu kali dia tak boleh bayar satu orang ni kan then I think the person will viral her
I don't know for me right cause she refunded us she got a lot of evidence nanti dia cakap dia ada evidence lah gedebak gedebuk lah you know but maybe ah kalau ada satu orang cakap anyone has any dealing with Aminah Muslim before muslimah before maybe I think a lot of people will comment
ya husnuzon lah mm
I mean ya I try but I'm not gonna order from her anymore the thing is I'm angry with her I'm quite upset cause she mentioned that I am dia punya regular customer which is which I my first time seh
how can you share a my conversation with another person saying that I'm to to to show that you are konon honest gitu lah kan
oh cause ah aku baca dia cakap nak kena uh only uh berapa percent jer melayu
no no melayu nak kena kurang daripada English actually
yes that's right so that's why you've been talking melayu all the way kan ah so you have to you cannot dia macam nak kena ada sixty percent of uh I think it's lower
so apa ni uh so that's why lah aku rasa macam
ah aku quite upset with her cause she you know she just mentioned my name without apa ni
suka suka cakap aku ni macam dia cover up her her her apa
ya cause she also mentioned to the person yang dia punya husband is not working for a few months already
the the one who sustain the business is the one yang dia scam kita you get what I mean or not
at times at times dia bukan kat situ at times bapa her father-in-law dia mother-in-law dia melayu
and laki dia melayu
uh huh dewa
ah all the Malay punya ni ah
mm so maybe she but but the person who uh the the refunded yang one K tu dia pergi dia dah pergi kedai dia
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the bapa mertua
ah yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si Aminah Muslim ni dekat dah lah aku tak tahu nama dia betul Aminah Muslim ke tak padahal dia put Aminah Muslim aje agaknya
and then after that dia apa ni uh she buy time again ah buy time
she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay sekali terus dia cakap ah I only have
ya lah she scam another person lah babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us macam aku will go and message her and then she will say oh minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
then uh in fact um this Aminah Muslim right uh the the other the other party who was also scammed by her ah dia also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
the the Thai suppliers told her that Aminah Muslim tak order langsung
so which sources and then Aminah Muslim Aminah Muslim ni macam cakap uh please show me the message macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak show kau message tu seh
dia kena buku dengan ruas eh yang orang suka kaki viral eh she will get it ah confirm
that's why that's why macam kita have to apa orang kata ambil sikit-sikit ah cuma aku nak tahu juga si Lia tu dapat daripada mana ni
mm that one is a love your style that one is love your style dia punya Facebook
oo okay I saw the the advertisement also she have a few uh few uh apa ni baju which is the same
twenty five lah dia tu
mm I hope this one is true lah at least we have a you know direct supplier yang trustable lah you know
I already told her just give us uh new design you tell us lah cause malaysia punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa
mm I'm not sure tapi tengok daripada Thai Thai punya supply juga I think
eh have you seen that patchwork that retro patchwork yang the baru punya retro marble ah
uh yang si Sadiah tu pun bawa and I saw a few others yang bawa
this it's it's pleated but it's the same like marble design but the colours are more glaring yang dia ni pun ada tunjuk aku Jenny ni dia ada tunjuk aku juga the colours lah but I I I feel like we already have the marble right right
ni pun tengok tengok ni lah babe tengok rezeki orang ah
ya ada yang big pleats ada yang smaller pleats
ada yang macam the quality yes ada yang termasuk
ya for me aku rasa yang macam ada tunic tu tunic is also considered as pleats kan tapi dia tak macam pleats sangat kau faham tak macam dia ada spread
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is pendek
just put it at Nina Sazali it will be a hot kicks lah for us habis lah
ah like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead kau nak kena ada manpower
macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa you know just on and as and when
ya so that's why for me when I do this um online thingy it's actually for for aku to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off punya event
but I think if you buy the garment kau tahu you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
berapa dah lima puluh ke kau eh fifty eh okay oh ya you're forty now ah
eh age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even Saadiah ah she said lah next year kita buka kedai lah I was like seriously
dia nak boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big ah you know like inside my heart oh no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
but then again I I think that she is like what you know semangat lima minit kind of person
oh kucing ah oh okay cat fighting ya
okay so like like I said lah so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like berkinja-kinja you know at the live she used my words like wanita lindungan kaabah all these you know and then but with me huh pening lah pening lah pening lah over here pening over there pening
the other one is the lady's punya ah um dia punya apa ni ah anak mmhmm
ya tak ada hati ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class meh cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me lah never mind lah I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know memang we never come out with a lot of money lah but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can lah mm
one one person one person one who really wanted so I I already told her that one is the Saadiah punya friend ah she wanted to buy she messaged me just now
nanti barang tak datang and then after that people will chase us I don't like all these you know I don't want to drama drama
ya my my mother side a lot eh my mother nya auntie dia punya buat downline banyak seh eh I think eh this thing is very good lah sarah I mean I'm the one who eat it right
I'm not saying to promote my my item lah but then again I feel that this is good Roslan makan pun he can find energy ya
ya he took ah sarah eh dia kerja malam kan dalam pukul dua belas dia makan kan it can help him to survive until five baru rasa ngantuk
whatever lah I mean if you then then like that is personally lah from my own experience yang I'm having right now I can talk personally to people outside lah without putting it in my Facebook right
dia macam tak kasi aku apa macam maintain ah maintain maintain my weight so far lah aku dah cause dia kasi kita process kan kita punya toksin kan
I am I am anti weight machine punya orang I wouldn't even like want want to go up
babe my my auntie kurus nya pun diabetic before that also she like that sia also diabetic it doesn't matter is your the way you eat
but then again ya lah eh just now I cooked asparagus sedap seh that day I get a free asparagus I got asparagus I don't know from um a donation drive from my block
not lah Workers Party punya agaknya
oh wow your husband don't want you to be an influencer I mean I mean you know what when you do this kind of charitable work eh or you know like you make to save the earth save the frog save the animals you know that kind of thing save food you know I mean at the end of the day you're actually giving to um orang yang memerlukan the feeling of that to do this social work is very very apa orang kata ya it's very rewarding in fact it is
ya it takes two hands ah ya I mean but if you have a husband who is quite macam understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause I mean he will let you go to do this it's good lah you know but I know that some people have different different perspectives of
marriage or you know how they want to control their partner lah or you can become the wanita lindung kaabah lindungan kaabah number three lah never mind lah redha redha
she will be in primary darjah dia baru darjah no darjah empat lah ah darjah it's primary four ya
kan so I don't I don't know ah it's very stress ah fikir kan ni semua
it is it is a must for me to change the school to Tampines cause it's better for her macam dia boleh rest after school cepat balik betul tak the Tampines north is very near to my house
so kalau dia dah balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four abang will be in secondary school so by the time I think he will be home by what four four also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
mm mm mm so I really hope this is really stressing me up also stressing abang up abang doesn't look stressed but I look stressed he was like saying chill lah mak I can do it
tepuk eh tepuk
alright here we are today what's up talking via this audio recording dan juga di zoom recording err macam
kejap ah kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
so aku tengok lah ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
err apa president the vice president
um I mean people have their own perspective and opinion lah but I think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like oh my god I can't believe this your statement I'm gonna unfollow you
ah itu kau boleh nampak different lah because
from that day onwards I'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam K I'm gonna unfollow you I'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear lah they just love to comments that's why I said there's a lot of them I'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni um barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via Carousell
nak beli eh ya that's crazy man like
plan B lah but sometime good eh kalau kita orang sekarang kena berwawasan sikit
ah macam dia lah dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined eh tak malu ah so this kind of people actually it's good for err business lah actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
uh so I think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then I just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days err maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them lah so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist lah all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
apa lagi ya
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar ah
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
apa lagi satu eh
there's err conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena kan
oh geram
tu wah rembat tu get so emotional rich
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya err wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
I think in is not something new ah because before that dia ada tunjukkan eh err lot of accidents or orang gaduh eh gaduh all this
so this man doesn't let her off easily ah kan surrounded with dekat orang gaduh kan so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ah he killed he killed some of this lady punya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak ah sekali tak eh
eh kau cerita lah
siapa they met a guy kat reunion
mm mm kan gared gared is the ni mm
I think tu bukan secretary itu attorney also
just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main err ni lah
so kesian
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are um a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal ah kita dah benchmark eh kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
second mesti ada subtitles because I tend to tak tak I kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am I going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru eh kuat sangat lah kutuk trailer
what else that we do err today oh kita ordered nasi ambeng eh
ah nasi ambeng dia adalah dari sebuah kedai ni
err ya not bad lah err like fifty bucks for two to three pax and then like the entire dulang
uh huh paru sambal goreng
kalau sayur tu kurang least favourite bukan pasal tak suka sayur apa tapi dia tak berapa lembut
ah masak sayur jadi lembut sikit eh
what else did we did today err we'd like to cover ourself with a lot of selimut selimut
selimut bukan semut K in case kau tak dengar so siapa yang tak dengar ni selimut S E L I M U T
ya hujan
hujan pun later started
camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek lah ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam jer
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no I'm going actually if I didn't end it I'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile oh my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya
primary four kot that time chill lagi anak-anak kecil ya
anak-anak headache
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana ah jadi aku berwaspada
err aku
I would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik eh in the botanical garden
some rabak ah rabak gila ah
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
ada aku suka yang kecil lah maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
ah tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
like you better shut dia macam fine lah you better shut up when we're not going to say anything I'm going to jump on her bag I say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's err grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap I tahu kenapa but yang that err he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
atau kau just
kurang ajar punya monyet eh
ah nak kasi kasi betul-betul lah
aiyo so crazy oh so now kita nak kena bawa kayu eh to frighten them ah
ah singapore ni monkey kayu jalan weh tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
oh ya man no kangaroo I got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
but I didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus sia ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like uh we bought quite a bit ah tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan seh like we bought like two two or one eh I don't remember
get fed by us ah the the time ah and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
birds and ni kan the ducks
they them datang ah
that's definitely but my um in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik like
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but I think this is gonna go higher because they are
we all know COVID is not easy thing for those who kena
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
how how do I put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and I think when we talk about ke apa kan
ya tapi aku rasa
I don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online lah kan
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan lah unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company ah so
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit eh lima belas minit ah
and those are not definitely feel macam ah you know I mean
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin ah
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and err ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap I felt that that's how it is lah
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then I think is not the time yet lah kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't lah not the time yet
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead lah
ya I think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly lah
so pasal kalau keluar kan orang wear mask kan and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu kan kita keluar I think they always go out go where pasar geylang ah
ah little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke ah membawang kan
mengopi lah mengumpat lah whatever lah sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
okay cerita lama okay
aku nak tengok ni drama perempuan tiada dosa eh perempuan yang tidak berdosa right ya

which was a bit macam irritating ah kan okay at that point of time um
err from my father's point of view ah kan okay then no no no kira in my father's point of view it was irritating ah
like err I think kira macam macam back then right um probably he was a
maybe he was tired then we got him at the wrong time so so dia bingit ah kan

I tried aku dah aku dah tried dude aku dah try jadi malas I can't do it
tak lah macam you see sometimes err we even though if macam kau nampak macam gemuk it's not it's nothing bad lah you know you are happy that's why you know like you you feel relaxed right right you know you you get my drift right macam ya
like apart from that like what happened I mean in okay then there was this one point of time yang kita didn't really meet during primary school eh or when you went to secondary school is it
kau during that time is kau like one err session different from me right
muka ni ah
when you were in primary school if you were in the morning morning apa session kalau kau morning session then aku will be in the afternoon right
early early journey tu kira apa oh kira kau keluar siang ah macam kau went out like around what let's say if I go out six you went out at five that kind ah
aku tengok balcony jer then I can see my school already

ya he eh busy bro every morning every morning eh without fail nanti lepas sarapan he will actually um like err probably around six or seven tujuh pagi ah gitu he will actually go out
you mean apa
oh he will he will keluar rumah he will keluar rumah then like um sometimes err just before I go to work then err there are times when
nanti dia dia relax dia relax kat rumah he chill he let the sunlight like rise a bit more then baru dia keluar
macam a lot of I mean apart from facilities pun ada juga like um opportunities for them to belajar lagi you know right right
skillsfuture apa ah
ya it happens I think eh um you I've noticed like you have quite a lot of err pedals ah pedals ah macam kau punya they they call it gadget ah gadgets
ya I think that you know you know why or not okay kau tahu asal because when when the transition right that is when we found music am I not right
no lah because of err the current situation you know macam susah ah
like I mean you it's impossible to actually keluar negeri you know you to to to get out even to you also because we love to go to like um macam nearby like your um furthest okay malaysia is lah
I mean to do that now is err sad to say it's impossible because of the current situation abeh macam kita rindu like we really miss our friends in in malaysia you know then there's japan korea and blah err whatever not but
yes yes live shows meaning macam err letak ah like facebook live then err ada
ada ada mm
tak active lah
direct lah lagi lagi reliable lah kan
mm iya lah tu
eh but ya aku faham ah like err because at one point of time also aku like I want to delete facebook
tak tahu eh macam it's it's actually a waste err like okay sometimes err or in fact most of the times ah when I look facebook right I look at facebook it's about it's news err like like err about the current situation than there's um
depends ah depends ya but is most of the time nanti kadang-kadang you know like like err news then there's err music updates abeh ah yang those bands yang aku like minat ah aku look up to their facebook then aku will try to see what's what's going on ah in their lives
updated ah but but but for me to macam okay for
aku nak post err benda-benda aku sendiri aku post like something macam bodoh ah like it's something funny never never serious tak pernah rasa macam leceh ah
mostly bila aku nak post tu is err kebanyakkan like err funny stuff ah I I don't like to post macam benda-benda serious ah ya macam entah life is too short to be serious
dia macam kelakar seram oh
oh ya ya the comments speaking of which actually we're supposed to talk about music right oh this is about music right okay okay sorry sorry sorry kugiran music(ppo
ya but anyways ya that that facebook thing that we are talking about sekarang ni kan macam I also agree ah like most of the time kan nanti aku tengok um the comments eh nanti aku kekek sendiri ah
very sungguh punya truthful
eh wait I'm sorry kau daripada penang kan
ni cerita betul lah ni
sorry to interrupt the the one in the picture outside ah oh that's your the grandfather that kau tengah berbual ni ah okay okay sorry carry on
speaking of many kids err aku punya cousin eh sorry kira mak aku punya cousin ah punya side eh
err no okay sorry let me err rewind a bit ah rewind sikit okay nenek aku punya kakak
my grand aunty ah kira ah grand aunty err she has seventeen kids ah dok
tujuh belas gila I mean
football team ada ada reserve ah yes so ya considered err wait ah grand aunty yes yes yes yes yes grand aunty
aku dengar sendiri pun like what ah you know
aku pun tak tahu ah aku forgot
yes tu kuih ah dok kuih kahwin kahwin
oh it's a kira macam french punya kind of err usually okay usually luke is L U K E kan
right ah so this is french kira french punya version of
luq apa ah
just err ya let's go back to like currently let's go back to the ya the which is music ah so kira like nowadays kau dengar what kind of um music ah
and then and then they will macam err terbawa-bawa abeh that's it
ah abeh then the next day they are your enemy ya
yes because okay err before okay before kita continue dengan kau punya music err current music err you err current music are you listening to
we used to grow up with macam err punk rock right punk rock then the ska then there's reggae and what what not right
era tu kira that time ah kan that era so but um
what got err kira-kira while how did you get into err this like current music that you are listening to
ya because I like to ask questions kan ah macam tak ah but because err like that time err like I really enjoyed macam
the fact that you were on drums because you knew what you were doing that's the most important part about being a drummer you just have to know what you're doing yang penting
kau terror
yang penting kau terror eh
dan sekarang kau main guitar
huh iya ke
yang penting kita terror bro
guitars ya macam okay because susah datang ah like it's usually okay when the macam drummers they will stick to macam drums all the way like throughout their lives drum drum drum drum drum then um
but you it's like a different case you before err after you like um kind of macam give up playing drums you actually went into right
oh gitu ya I actually tried you know macam
um or like techno or err what what what genre do you mention earlier on tadi
ah okay okay despite I want to understand macam further err okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song kan so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is kira macam kau nak make
err like err a track from scratch betul tak
okay so okay in in in bands punya kind of a point of view band eh it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with err kira main cover ah gitu
betul tak ah
which is a bit ya leceh ah kan macam might as well we play err kita punya own originals so that is what you want to achieve in
ni lounge eh
eh kira macam during that time bila bila kau do all that kan macam
best tak
oh that explains kira guitar tu is mostly um bila kau dah like into dirty blues and stuff like that lah
um boleh ah boleh boleh cope
err sometimes susah susah nak err apa
mm susah nak
sekarang selalu lepas itu

then macam ah nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay
oh in Australia belajar macam basics like Mathematics English
err habis tu I also belajar macam
oo my most favorite ah is definitely um belajar apa ni Law because it's very interesting lah like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's uh it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn
dalam err Singapore punya education I mean secondary school punya subject
ya I feel I feel you macam susah nak nak part dengan family kan
eh uh the dalam sekolah you do you do macam any
ya floorball is fun I last time before I pindah to Australia I was also in a floorball team
tak fair
hopefully lah maybe you can try next year you know never know your kau punya chance kan
huh biar betul
wah I've never heard before eh I thought you only can join like you know your only your faculty punya apa tu punya wah I didn't know you can actually do that
oh um sekarang I tengah ambil apa ni interaction design so not a lot of people know about this course because like my school is like the only school yang ada this course
um basically kat dalam course ni I do macam coding dengan design it's a very
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now macam um banyak benda is like about technology kan so ya I feel like this course uh actually benefit me lah in the future
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak uh brainstorm ideas uh for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so uh for you ah you said you were in like um marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
then uh uh besides sekolah kan like what what do you like to do macam do you have macam other hobby ke or apa apa benda lah
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school pastu ada apa O level abeh stress takle fikir yeah
oh during my free time I suka
uh macam uh draw I also like to err tengok apa ni
ah anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because takde time kan poly dalam I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to uh do my hobbies which is kind of uh macam sedih but yeah so
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
but um I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then um maybe in uh um year two then I will start macam join like start trying out for ah I've actually picked
macam a few is err firstly is ah floorball like um aku kata tadi kan as I've mentioned uh floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
ya it is it is that's why macam I'm like a bit takut to um you know join their team because err macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
but I think right I think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
oh mesti sakit eh
then the the surgery bila
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia dia kata like
um it's actually not that painful lah because like you know they put you in uh on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think ah after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects kan so ya
how how how would you feel like macam you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like macam like your feeling
uh I've never I've never apa ni had any surgeries before
I can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit
tak lah I never say
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause ah
apa ni I I love doing calligraphy right so I like macam I have I have like a mini business where
I uh buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like um quite a reasonable price lah so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
uh I like aiya basically like um doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people kan you know singaporeans kan diorang suka macam study kan then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
kan sekarang COVID kan so like uh kat dalam rumah what do you do
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also macam a good way lah for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam COVID kan
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border dah buka then we can go
after macam this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is uh mana ni Japan
I've been there bila when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so macam tak ingat uh I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also macam if it's like an interesting country ah macam menarik you know pasal
like because uh I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap ah so I was like okay ah then I I think if if cause I like to collect
the the work is macam due next week kan then I would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
always use my I'm on my handphone asyik tengok Instagram semua then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like oh dah lambat ah just tidur lah besok boleh buat
macam like group projects eh
oh recently I I ada macam this one err group project like I just finished macam err dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because uh
so my group kita buat we did this uh macam is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time ah pakai then it's like susah ah then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting ah so like when users uh see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next uh page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
Animal Crossing is a very in game now eh a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main ah then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
macam look forward to ah
wah that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
yeah it's good also because like kan year three we ada internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for um untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but I didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so I think macam it's quite it's quite beneficial lah like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
I also had like a similar a similar module I did apa ni uh previously
where also same it's called uh effective effective err communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know err if err communicate effectively and how to like you know gain uh confidence
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting ah but macam sedih ah because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me ah from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who err is uh confident enough ah to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
and macam it's like quite cool lah because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me err there's this macam ada this uh girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like eh I heard you're in the in the same course
then uh she's like uh let's be friends ah then from there uh we started being friends ah then err when during poly because err mostly it was on Zoom right because of macam this COVID situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so err ya then err in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy lah in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing macam susah is that uh is like the modules ah because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never macam done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
oh I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
macam the badge gitu so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift one ah so it's not bad ah tapi panas gila
and the and the worst thing kan towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like eh nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal lah my then my friend dah tak boleh take it kan then she was like ah batal jer lah
eight hours was uh painful lah then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of Tampines ya but it was very very rewarding pasal uh at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
huh biar betul
kay lah not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside lah donate also
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
penat I couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade kan already dah ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa ah kita stand
under the hot sun then collect lor but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like alamak shouldn't have told them
ya true hopefully lah I I I really wish macam this COVID situation will macam die down ah because it really affects ah kita punya life
okay hari ini I went to bath and body works
I went to apa itu to err the dia punya outlet dekat takashimaya sebab I nak beli dia punya err scented candle
ya black friday hari ini
but it's very it's a very it's I'm very disappointed lah because dia punya sale kan
patutnya hari ini banyak um barang-barang kan tapi like semua macam sudah run out macam like the day before dia orang dia orang had a sale
tak best ah tahun ini tak best
you know I went to three one three then after that err tengok-tengok baju tapi so macam they say the price is lowered tapi macam it's still expensive you know
ya semua tempat pergi semua crowded
ya really and then tak payah keluar tak payah queue semua
just now um I was lucky lah because I thought they had this early bird sale and everything then I tunggu pukul sembilan pagi all the way till eleven plus masih belum buka
tak macam dia punya sale on black friday kan macam kaw kaw usually it's kaw kaw but this year macam it's so mellowed down
ya then like um malaysia punya lagi kaw dia orang punya black friday tapi I heard from my cousin dia orang punya black friday like no black friday
ya economy so bad already malaysia kasihan
same sudah lah murah
no not thai odyssey apa nama dia err no another one healthland
worth it sangat and then like kalau you pergi yang punya there are few outlets lah tapi the best one right you find the biggest outlet itu yang paling best
dia bukan spa it's totally all full thai massage
I pun tak ingat hundred and twenty minutes I sudah lama tak pergi nak dekat how many close to a year tak pergi
ya sedih ah
the pasar tani
ya no not normal pasar tau pasar tani
bukan pasar malam dia macam pasar pagi tapi tani lah like macam-macam lah you get like err avocado smoothie lah
then after that pineapple juice lah macam-macam ah I like
oh ah ah ya ya ya queue dia selalu panjang kan
then like kalau I masuk malaysia kan I selalu datang pagi like very very early then dia punya crowd tak sangat macam teruk sangat lah still manageable
kalau ya
ah ada lah
tak shops belum buka sebab I straightaway pergi pasar tani so I sudah sampai situ kan by the time I reach situ sudah six plus
then six plus tunggu kat pasar tani itu err I think about fifteen twenty minutes until dia punya set up semua sudah start then we go in ah
oh my favourite is avocado juice memang sedap
no um I also tak suka sayur tapi macam dia punya avocado juice is like the indonesian style dia macam campur gula melaka semua
ya it's nice dia manis yes
ya can memang sedap
yang dekat singapore punya you can try indonesian restaurants yang dekat I'm sure indonesian restaurant anywhere in singapore ada dia nama jus alpukat
ya tapi memang sedap if I have to choose a favourite drink that would be my favourite drink I really love avocado juice
tak ah I don't really like fruit fruit juice tapi like I don't know ah avocado is just an exception
malaysia yes I selalu pergi situ like staycation with my family over there tapi kalau staycation dekat singapore memang tak lah
ya and then might as well you duduk dekat rumah kan your own home
ya itu lah
yes is enough memang cukup uh sedih merana
I was like okay basically right I kalau tak pergi massage sudah berapa bulan kan my back will hurt so much
so I jenis macam how to say I'm very picky with my massage massage punya tempat tau I don't like indonesian style massage it's very painful
always yes tapi thai massage dekat singapore semua macam so expensive
ada eh
wah nak try ah
sebab indonesian punya uh style kan javanese style punya ya allah I bentan urat the urat the next day my whole body ache like mad kadang-kadang tak boleh bangun pun
yes it's very bad but ya but for thai massage kan I macam the next day more more active and boleh buat macam-macam
um I try both dua-dua I suka
I prefer the traditional one sebab dia dia push your body macam macam way then bunyi ketap-ketup wah
ya sedap
tapi you kena pergi yang macam err healthland lah that one professional and thai odyssey lah tapi jangan pergi yang um tepi-tepi jalan punya that one a bit scary ah

why sedap eh
ya sebelah sebelah jer kan ya but then you also should try the downstairs one the thai food memang sedap
chey macam promoting dia punya tom yum I tak pernah rasa tapi I pernah rasa dia punya green curry dengan dia punya err pineapple fried rice these those are my favourite
okay I remember the sebab dia ada dua kedai thai err one is called nana
and then nana you just walk straight turn left sebelah dia sudah it's literally beside it it is called something something thai food
this kita hari kecil saja
oh kalau you datang pukul sebelas atau pukul dua belas memang ramai orang tak ada tempat duduk
so I suggest ya weekdays I suggest you datang pukul sepuluh and below lah
I think not so crowded tapi pukul sebelas I can guarantee you banyak orang
ya ya and it's like cheap affordable and memang sedap
cartoon network I suka tengok err apa itu masa zaman I kecil-kecil lah I like to watch scooby doo
then err captain caveman and apa eh road runner
err ya I love these three last time right masa I kecil-kecil pukul err lima pagi I macam ada schedule tau at five right I will watch captain caveman then after that scooby doo and then after that in the day I will watch road runner
stop watching it right ya me also ya same tapi right my love for scooby doo right is still there somehow
dia macam how to say ah dia sudah macam cari hantu
you know like dia macam cerita budak-budak kan jadi dia punya hantu semua merepek-meraban tak tak macam hantu betul
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you tau
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini oh bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type I like lah
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like I suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya err apa itu plush toy
no lah dia anjing apa scooby doo anjing so okay lah I just have it like for fun because it's like memory my favourite cartoon I'll have one lah
yang piglet itu ke
yay you know like masa I dekat indonesia indonesia kan macam tak banyak cartoon kan
so like at like in the middle of the night I suka buka so like in the middle of the night dia orang boleh main shaun the sheep ya and then I watch till the next morning then my mum macam bangun like eh you haven't sleep no I watch shaun the sheep the whole night night ya then that is how I like shaun the sheep is very funny
dia kejap eh hmm I think it was in indonesian
ya dia macam voice over gitu
ya I also pelik
ya ah ya ya dia punya mouth memang tak in sync and it's not satisfying
ya ya ya betul betul
then right you always go malaysia right you pernah nampak cartoon ini nama larva tak
dia larva bukan volcano tahu dia larva is err macam ulat
dekat mana I tak tahu location dia tapi I tahu dia punya mall nama capital
ya tapi dia punya tingkat atas is just an indoor theme park for the kids then dekat bawah semua normal shopping mall
boring tapi larva itu memang funny
okay I don't like but my mum seems to like it which is so pelik ya very pelik my favourite is oggy and the cockroaches
oh ya I mean I also geli dengan cockroaches but after watching that show kan macam I pandang cockroach macam it's the oggy the cockroaches ya ya then I outgrew that fear of cockroach already so ya cause I find them funny
yes ya tapi tapi kan I have a phobia for spiders
I tak boleh spiders I will see if the spider is like one meter away I will scream I just cannot see spider
ya I just cannot phobia sangat because what happened was last time when I was kecil kan err I don't know whether is it dream or it actually happened but I was inside a car then after that the whole car dalam interior of the car is filled with spiders
ya ya I don't know whether is it a nightmare or real because that happened when I was a kid so after that terus I phobia
I tak boleh tengok spider
aiyo I can feel you alamak kalau I pun phobia
aduh aduh kalau I pun phobia seh
ya and then like what triggers it more is that my parents left me sebab dia orang nak pergi beli barang sekejap
ya then my parents found me crying macam orang gila
err but I really don't know whether it actually happen or is it a bad dream itu saja
my parents cakap they never leave me in the car before itu yang pelik
sampai I boleh phobia macam ini
ya until now that time err masa I kecil I pergi school camp pun sama
bukan ada spider we literally set our err khemah on a grass a grassland filled with macam spider tanah
ya spiders tapi dia orang on the tanah so like malam-malam I felt something on me I nampak spider I menjerit I literally went hysterical
ya then I ran I ran to the err guard posts semua then after that it took me berapa jam ah to calm down can you imagine you phobia then you nampak that thing on you
phobia ya ya on top of it you know then bila ya exactly then bila um I pekik itu kan can you imagine I pekik pukul dua pagi everyone bangun then everyone nampak yang dia punya tent is infested with spiders
so can you imagine the kecoh
I I tak kisah I campak semua barang I ada kipas dekat situ I campak kipas I campak lamp post anything over there I campak I just ran masuk toilet and I literally drenched myself with water
then after that I keluar I lari pergi dia punya teacher's post
they calm me down dia orang kasih apa dia orang kasih makan milo semua then after that err sudah reda dia orang cakap eh what happen to you boleh tanya lagi what happen to me aduh then after that I explain lah then dia orang cakap oh patut lah kau hysterical yang lain semua okay sudah dia orang sudah move tempat lain sudah I saja yang hysterical sebab mmhmm spiders ya
cause I find like big bang punya new music is like different tau now dia orang sudah disbanded kan jadi macam sedih ah
ya I listen to those two band sekarang kan banyak orang suka right
but sorry to say lah I tak suka dia orang
I I kalau cakap I tak suka kan kawan I semua kutuk I jadi I say ah ya I like their music
ya sudah tua bangka pun suka K pop
aduh dia orang have a pop up store dekat singapore tahu dekat plaza sing
I pun tak ambil
ya now I never listen to shinee shinee I used to call it shinee you know shinee shiny see sampai sekarang dia bawa bawa
shinee aduh so like last time masa I kecil kan I obsessed sangat dengan big bang um so my file every page of my file kind of the film kind
thin film I akan tulis quotes from big bang
ya bedsheet pun big bang bantal pun big bang
ya I memang crazy about big bang dulu
ya I think so dia punya story very pelik lah dia punya story it involves almost everyone that you didn't expect
ya macam gitu kan like uh I tak sangka I was really shocked
ya sedih duh I was like genuinely sad when I heard that he's out of big bang like wah I grew up with them tau
tapi if you follow him on instagram sekarang kan dia macam a bit siao ting tong ah
uh huh tak percaya you tengok instagram dia
macam siao ting tong serious
itu satu and um dia macam artsy fartsy actually I don't know whether he's like the sudah gila ke err dia memang buat-buat macam gila because dia punya post pun macam pelik-pelik
I don't know how to explain to you tapi post dia memang pelik semua
right pelik kan
macam sudah a bit off
err bedsheet pun ada
then tahun lepas I pergi err dia punya making of the studio
dia punya official set punya tempat
okay um depends lah kalau you fan memang lah it's your heaven there tapi kalau you tak suka harry potter then don't waste your money there
tapi dia punya set ya allah besarnya
dia it's so big then I think it took us like four hours to finish the whole thing
ya ya ya then sudah lah jauh daripada london so basically we empat jam over there and then after that one hour pergi one hour balik
tapi it's best kalau you nak pergi kan you ambil set lah so there is a bus hantar you bus ambil you
macam mana nak kira duh
I pernah pergi
okay okay I tak nak boast lah
most I haven't gone to err eastern europe yet macam prague itu semua belum pergi
no I I have never been to myanmar tapi I um my grandma is burmese
my grandpa sudah sudah pass away sudah
it's like um I decided not to learn burmese but memang susah
uh huh very mixed lah this family ya best lah I mean dia macam ya lah tapi like my my mum malay lah of course but my grandmother dia kahwin dengan melayu
ya my atuk is good looking not boasting tapi when I look at him memang wah any woman akan suka dengan dia at that time
then after that dapat my mum so malay lah I
ya melayu melayu lah melayu boleh
eh tak ada lah
okay ah oh but walaupun um ada sedikit campur err dia punya err darah kan tapi I hold very strongly to uh hang tuah
dengan P ramlee
dia rumah betul dia tapi they convert to museum
ya then um for hang tuah I memang suka history and everything macam gitu lah
so ya I pergi perigi hang tuah
ya perigi hang tuah
oh because dia macam dia bukan attraction to public tahu jadi macam orang-orang yang macam singaporean yang biasa yang tak suka history dia orang tak akan tahu tempat itu kalau dia orang tak buat research
so like macam I memang suka like zaman-zaman dulu punya history kan so I like dig out lah then after that I felt oh hang tuah ah I should go
um the I don't know if you know the puteri gunung ledang
puteri gunung ledang is also another story
oh baru add eh
ya who doesn't watch bujang lapuk
but ya lah fun lah but I ini suka discover about all this malay malay punya history kan so I literally baca pasal puteri gunung ledang and I'm already intrigued
err I pergi library satu thing satu pasal then the other one is internet lor
okay reading itu depends on um what book it is
ah ah kalau you give me roald roald dahl is it called roald dahl
I tak akan baca
best ke
oh that one notebook punya orang kan
ya ya they were just jealous jealous sikit aduh ya that's why ya yay I found find a friends fan okay so basically kan um I boleh bangun nowadays ah I boleh bangun pukul lima and then I'll be like okay I'm bored I'm going to watch friends really
ya oh my god same you feel me yay err then masa I pergi itu kan I happened to go to primark primark suka ada macam themed err themed christmas style so they will sell all the themed punya barang-barang lah so I pergi to this err one of the primarks lah then I saw a friends collection
pullover ya macam jacket tak ada zip
ya ya ya memang cosy gila
kalau I kan I tak nak branded you just give me primark and I will be happy for life
sebab they have themed
they have themed accessories itu one thing the other thing is that it's murah
um of course lah there is a different sikit lah tapi dia macam tak melampau macam other other kind of brands lah
and it's still worth it because you tak akan jumpa primark dekat singapore
sudah lama pakai pun masih okay
you pernah tengok yang um monkey tak
I suka tengok
ya ya ya that one mantis sembahyang solat mantis
uh apa eh aku pun sudah lupa
aku sudah cakap solat mantis tengok lah ketawakan orang

orang tak tahu apa gusi gusi is gum
I mean nervous pun macam gusi you don't know what is gusi
aduh and then there's one person cakap apa I don't have gusi
kelakar lah
I also don't like watch local youtube tapi because I like to um macam bab melayu-melayu ini I suka dengar orang macam tersasul ke apa kan so I suka tengok itu then laugh my lah lah you know

ya sudah tak ada sudah
I think the ya the last romance movie ah I tengok dekat cinema is apa eh crazy rich asians

but what am I saying uniqlo punya baju semua comfortable
ya uniqlo punya memang really the best ah
tapi if you want to find like macam vintage vintage and oversized shirt kan cotton on is still the best though
okay I tak suka oversized shirt tapi depends kalau dia punya

then when I was primary six we went on a holiday then after that I kena accident
then in the accident like I was at bali then I was going back to singapore from malaysia then after that uh the car swerved cause like something hit my dad's car dari belakang tau then after that he swerved inside the longkang
then after that he went atas balik like he swerve the car back up lah but then when he got back the car on the road was like the other side you know like how it apa tu the car cars are going this way his car was already like this side and he stop then after that four of my siblings were out of the car like tercampak keluar then when I suddenly I was in this longkang like nasib I sedar diri if not they wouldn't like find me cause I was in a very deep longkang but then my legs were all in pain so I cannot like panjat the longkang ah cause I wasn't that steep but my legs was really really in pain then I shouted for help then this guy piggyback me up cause ambulance wasn't there at that point in time so I was put inside this car then my adik was also inside that car also aiman aiman
dia pun kat dalam kereta tu then after that bila ambulance datang I was like vomiting a lot lah because like the apa itu how to say ah traumatic

then after that um my mum also not happy you know malaysia right they they ask you they insist that you go to apa itu that you stay in the malaysia then they ask you for money every single time they ask you for duit every single time
uh they ask for duit everytime then you know even my my adik want to wants to go back to singapore cause my mum already dah already going to inside ambulance you know the nurse have the audacity to say my mother that he cannot bring the baju that he was wearing cause that is hospital punya baju

ya cause that time we went during raya what
then after that she also satu hal ah I think she don't like me also then she
her mum pakai tudung I think she is religious
disappointed she she ah dia pun ada adik the adik I think now secondary school still

cute ah dia dulu
shut up diam ya every morning
then after that um then after that he confess his feelings that's like okay ah I I mean can just okay then we keluar together
and then after that like I'm when I was relationship with him right I didn't felt like myself like I even like cause that time I was ready like after after uh secondary school then I during secondary school cause I wasn't wearing hijab fully what
then after that after secondary school I wanted to like legit wear hijab and not let guys see see my hair but then like he says that it's okay to see my hair
haikal now with another girl that time kat paya paya lebar kita nampak dia pe
siapa no she don't he don't have chinese girlfriend
with izzat I didn't even think about it at all but when we started obviously but when I was with afiq like he really like he really I mean about the bare necessities he really respected me like he didn't insist on like nak tengok rambut pay more runway or something the whole time he that one
is the ya but it's very apa oh ya ya but it's very rare to find cause all my exes like that one they don't care that kind of thing
then like dia kerja kat cafe
ya and dia kerja cafe sekarang actually I want to no but then it was very like he didn't even pandang orang bertudung
legit his friends know that about him and then he out of all his friends he he's the one who don't date much and then like ya and then he used to very mean before he met me like let's say he has a strong opinion again he will just blurt it out like and then if I even if you are good mates with him right he will just like straightforward say oh you're not doing your shit better do your shit now that kind of thing like but after he met me he became like better lah like he don't straightforward say because he try to jaga my hati at first he don't know how to jaga hati perempuan then I was like at first I was annoyed you know that one month when I started talking to him I actually wanted to stop talking to him you know
because I know then he will have like a strong opinion with it I started out slow then sometimes obviously I become mad then I tell him I mad at you he's like kenapa marah I was like I don't know you figure out yourself then he's like like it's the first time someone tell him that to him like then after that I think from there he start to take care of feelings more even his friends cakap that there is banyak difference from him dulu and sekarang ya which is good lah then after that from that like eh this guy is different like really really different from my exes

I don't like bus sebab every time I take bus I feel like I senang get lost
but now okay lah better cause maybe I a bit more pandai now
dekat opposite this sia dulu here our old house that time habis sekarang kat sini ya the bus masuk like around here I got lost trying to get back to our old house macam budak bodoh saya
I have I I mean like dulu ingat sikit lah macam nak jalan pergi library ke pe

they always yishun tempat dodgy
actually yishun got quite a lot of places like kalau compare dengan tempat lain it has ada juga mix dia

you go yang kat mana
oh oh kat situ
leceh ah nak belajar dekat luar tapi all the seats all cannot they don't allow us to sit
kat mana seh
err di ada orang belajar I think telcom ada orang belajar err airport also ada orang belajar seh
eh I wanna buy some stuff from Shopee but I I know like I don't have duit now but like just
a little bit cause I got something that I really need right now so macam uh kinda need like a proper charger yang tak rosak
I mean you can check the review what ada yang not bad pe
I want to buy a lasting filer sebab yang filer kita ada always so soft then like a few use then dah tak boleh pakai lagi
that's it's easier but like dia macam satisfying juga ah nak tengok
macam mana dress dia
I think it was me I liked it but like pendek sangat ah I don't like when my legs are like too exposed
kira nak tutup sikit lah but like like I don't like it when the dress is like above my lutut
uh I don't know I just nak try dulu sebab I feel like silver necklace macam tak kena sangat because
lagi lawa and fitting as a necklace then silver but like with other jewelry macam earring and rings
feel like silver lagi lawa
I hope like when school start next sem dia dah buka balik and like kita boleh balik sekolah because I cannot tahan anymore
my become so rabak sia
just in case bro the four pointer in my school drop tier like this sem he got like two point nine sia dia boleh drop sampai three point six from a four pointer
kesian seh
oh yay can to school then I can tidur I can tidur in the car yay
keluarkan kereta sendiri ah
huh serious ah dia cakap gitu
motor convenient tapi but nak bayar a bit ya ya ya
as seen from my friends dia orang
I would go for motor lesen but like ada satu motor ni saya selalu nampak dia black it's like black
it's Yamaha but I still don't know what model it is tapi it's so pretty
tak boleh ya
then like you spend money on it tapi tak pakai
oh ya yang electric punya
then owning kereta sendiri
habis nak spend lagi
wow wow dah kaya
I told you I already bilang you that I'm not good at it what
I just don't like it sebab nanti kadang dia rasa melekit tu
sebab macam campur dengan peluh ugh cause I always put it like in that in between joints
tak suka sangat ah
I actually don't mind it sia sebab it stop me from garuk
can don't pemalas or not
tapi kalau dah ada why would I buy mah
err rarely sebab sekarang tengah pakai mask so like I don't see the sun why would I wear
right see it's a two way thing not bukan I saja pe
I think is their like new collection ke apa
I have never ada interest in wallets I feel like asalkan it can hold my cards and my money
mm pada pendapat saya
kalau boleh I want a fit body because err I suka main bola err football kan
so err kalau I'm more fit I can you know run faster err I can play better I can improve my performance ah in game
kan you tahu I main untuk err kelab bola
err dan
apa tu err
err I juga suka pergi gym I like
bila I go to gym I
of course kadangkala like of course everyone wants to have good looks lah you know you go out then if take photo with friends or what or like you know you want to get girlfriend all you need good looks what so err ya lah ya got pros and cons lah for both but
err mungkin I pick the fit body lah
mm yang tu betul juga err
going by that thought process kalau gitu mungkin I pun nak ah good looks ah sebab
err macam you kata pe good looks tu err semua genetics tapi fit body I can I can train you know I can work for it especially now we are young right so fit body is a bit easier to get lah you know then
err tapi bila dah tua err semua tu good looks semua
habis lah jadi
kalau long term
aku rasa fit body lebih penting lah sebab untuk err general health and well-being kan
illnesses you know heart problems diabetes ke apa
err kalau gitu
mungkin kan sekarang everyone err selalu cakap pasal err global warming ni global warming tu our climate change ke apa I mean you just look at our weather lah everyday also in the forecast also always wrong one they say rain won't rain will be so hot then kalau err hujan pun
can have sun sometimes then it's like macam air panas aje
so I feel like err humans will go extinct from like all these like global global warming factors lah err mungkin like slowly over time when the sea levels rise ke then all the you know kampung by the the seaside all will become flooded and stuff like that or like mungkin will have err
lebih banyak err natural disaster semua
tsunami ke gempa bumi ke
extinct mungkin kalau macam sekarang ada COVID kan tu virus
tu virus semua like
especially kalau tengok err kalau singapore okay lah sekarang itu case semua sudah fall a lot right
mungkin dia orang punya culture semua berbeza kan jadi
err mereka suka peluk semua kan jadi like this kind of like easily transmitted disease through contact
ini dua faktor lah yang mungkin akan ah menyebabkan err we as humans to go extinct lah
you cakap pasal africa kan tadi aku ingat lah err kat sekolah we learn about econs right err they always talk about the income inequality increasing and all that like and then they talk about the millennium development goals then aku teringat lah pasal err err extreme hunger err yang disrupt disebabkan oleh poverty kan jadi
I feel mungkin that's another reason lah there could be the could be the factor or the the cause of like err humans slowly like the population reducing lah I'm not sure if you boleh sampai extinct semua tapi
err I feel like it could reduce their population a lot overtime if the let's say you know econs they teach us they measure by gini coefficient right if it keep increasing increasing the rich get richer yang miskin jadi lebih miskin then um
err all these err kind of err things like malnutrition all also can increase the diseases and all that because your immune system tak kuat kan jadi
the income inequality makin naik and the
ya lah so maybe the if the government don't do um anything to tolong kan the orang yang miskin orang yang
tak mampu then um
maybe lah this could be a factor that might contribute but mungkin err bukan main cause lah untuk err menyebabkan err apa tu err extinction of humans
skill tu you like do you mean like err
if that's the case right I mean maybe untuk saya lah err
I hope to be able to how to say macam like
boleh read people better lah
cause kalau gitu I can I boleh faham apa yang orang tengah fikir tu and I can like um
I err mungkin err bukan saja cara you cakap tapi err
mungkin err body language intonasi semua err
err ya lah itu like that's one of the first skill like I feel like err would be very beneficial lah and it's bukan satu skill yang senang untuk belajar pun it's like
lebih banyak confidence ah like especially um
dalam scenario macam public speaking depan err banyak orang
um like stage confidence lah not not just speaking you know maybe like anything in front of a large group of people lah but like err buat err presentation ke err nak buat acting ke err
anything that has to do with like err maybe a high pressure situation or err like situations with like other consequence kan macam like pertandingan bola ke where there's a there's a price at hand you you can you can dapat something lah you can win something at the end of the pertandingan ah so
like this kind of err situation where you tend to put pressure on yourself or a lot of people watching you like let's say ada coach yang tengah scouting err player yang err baru yang young talent semua
err I feel like it's it's a very useful skill lah next time bila nak kerja semua kalau boss aku err suruh err buat presentation depan err colleagues aku semua then you know if I have the confidence I after preparing all my things I can present well do a good presentation dia orang semua faham apa yang I nak cakap
then um kalau the third skill maybe err
like being more optimistic err positive fikiran semua err mindset
nak err aku nak yang
lebih ceria lah like I punya mood semua like
I feel like kalau any problem aku hadap
if I face it with like a a a positive mindset err kalau err as hard as it can be susah ke tak susah I can I can convince myself motivate myself to go through whatever struggles and skill ni penting cause it can help me to push through like let's say um
err gym kalau aku penat ke apa my next my next set I can just err keep staying positive motivate myself in my mind I focus on my goals and I just pursue them
besides gym lah like err bola ke like next time nak kerja ke anything in life like I I feel like ni ni benda ni confidence dengan yang positive tu err sangat penting lah but ia bukan skill yang
senang untuk err cultivate ini skill err mesti
ambil time yang lama lah mesti build up over time tapi kalau sekarang I boleh dapat ah tiga-tiga skill ni wah paling best ah
oh third one macam like err it's like a positive mindset you have like a optimistic outlook on life you know yourself worth you know you know why you belong and you you are self driven self motivated
apa-apa pun boleh lah
wah kalau free tu
tapi kalau gitu overlap macam skill kan bukan saja benda physical
sekarang sekarang benda yang high value kan yang kita kena bayar banyak
err let's say err gold ke or stocks yang property ke apa
bila you cakap free kan
free untuk kita sendiri ke free untuk semua orang
kalau gitu stocks lah kerana kalau I boleh dapat stocks yang banyak
I boleh jual I boleh dapat wang lagi yang banyak lepas tu I can just use it to spend on whatever I want lah whatever else I want because by then I'll be rich what
dia percuma untuk saya tapi untuk orang lain orang lain kena bayar jadi the value is still there but only for me is free so I can use this method to I can keep purchasing all these stocks especially now you look at tesla ni semua
err apa-apa lah yang err involve dengan benda teknologi
semua ni benda err dia punya stocks semua naik naik exponentially lah
if I boleh dapat ni benda semua I I can just you know err
then from there I can build up my wealth I can become rich boleh tolong keluarga saya kawan-kawan saya semua you know I can I can whatever that is material I can dapat dengan wang err I can I can have lah
like time is limited lah setiap hari tak ada dua puluh empat jam sahaja
I tahu lah kita tinggal di singapura ni singapore so small right they always say like you want to get to one side of the island to the other side is a short time only compared to other big countries but
kalau you boleh teleport you nak pergi kerja pergi sekolah you know you want to visit your friends family wherever in the world also
just having that additional satu dua jam setiap hari I mean it could be even more for some people because
you can get more sleep your tidur is good you err
your health pun lebih baik um
you know you nak err like
ada orang kan yang
dia orang err very stress at work or that they are they live very busy life all consumed by their work
but until dia orang takde masa untuk keluarga
tapi bila ada lebih masa ni you boleh spend time dengan keluarga ke girlfriend ke apa you know your family time is a is a very err important thing but I feel like in today's world is err is lacking lah because err people who are always in a rush no not enough time because of
travelling and all that you know like selalu kalau err jalan sesak traffic jam or accident hujan ke then you waste even more time lah so if you can teleport around you know I mean unrealistic lah but superpower right so if you can teleport around of course ideally not just yourself lah if other people also then you nak pergi holiday over the weekend pun boleh apa err so
you as a as a person your like whoever is around you lah cause you can teleport you yourself and then semua sama-sama pergi mana-mana pun boleh
are you more of a marvel fan atau you lebih suka
mungkin hulk lah kerana
dia tu like
he's still a normal human being lah but bila dia marah then then only dia transform kan jadi like
if I'm always having to be seen as the superhuman superhero with superpower then like I feel like the expectation terhadap diri saya akan it will be very high lah from everyone from myself all but if I can still be like a normal human being at the same time as being a superhero
tapi like as needed lah I can I can still possess
kalau you
untuk saya I feel like a lot of people like sebab I banyak training like
like err semua orang selalu label me as like err buff strong whatever
especially dulu bila bila eh err start of this year right when I had the shoulder err shoulder surgery and all that
whenever I am injured lah like not just the shoulder surgery actually like dulu I pun ada ankle sprain ni semua
I selalu err rasa macam
hati tersinggung sikit lah kerana like
um be at the level that high level of fitness um because everyone err selalu tengok saya macam
like bukan sahaja uh dari segi performance tapi like
bila I ganti baju pun kawan saya pun selalu kacau saya pasal err
badan saya lah jadi like if I feel like if I'm not on point at one point also like
as much as pressure tu tekanan tu
boleh tolong untuk err drive you motivate you tapi like if you don't know how to manage it you don't know how to handle it or you let's say you memang your mood
it can affect you sometimes and like it can pull you down even further lah you boleh cause itu macam apa tu dia orang panggil macam spiral
jadi susah sikit lah untuk you nak um
terukan aktiviti harian lah or your
because everything needs your willpower right like even you nak ganti baju nak pilih baju apa untuk pakai pun it takes you like some willpower to think about what you are going to do so like when you are lacking that willpower you memang bukan malas lah tapi like you really not feeling it like you just don't want to do any anything you nak just like
is it can become a real mood killer lah as much as like oh you think like err having this fit body like we said earlier lah tadi um
biasanya dilihat sebagai suatu label yang baik lah tapi
mungkin at times can be a bad label also lah I feel but
I feel like this is the paling paling common lah yang label yang semua kawan-kawan saya
dream occupation saya is err to be a physiotherapist kan so
also in five years six years time lepas uni depends on my situation lah if especially
kalau I masih single ke I dah attached because like if I have someone else then I have to
like err bukan sahaja keluarga tapi ni
I need to of course like devote some portion of my time to that person lah but okay err kalau kita assume tak ada orang tu I masih single I
masih tengah focus on my own goals
err lepas habis uni I'm probably be bonded to err one of the err government hospital kan
my work hours mungkin tak akan flexible sangat jadi
whatever free time yang I ada mungkin like
sekali seminggu lah I I will just contact my family and all then just check on them and then like um like how to say like
I I still go to the gym you know err kalau tak cukup masa maybe just a short workout lah empat puluh lima minit ke apa
you know and ideally would be of course with a with a friend lah cause kalau you train seorang-seorang pun err after a while it it kind of
could be a bit boring sometimes could be unmotivating and stuff tapi ideally if you have always have err
a training partner especially a training partner who selalu banyak tenaga banyak tenaga very like
energetic you know err selalu err give you a lot of vocal cues you know pushing you
bila dia spotting you kan then err I feel like that that would be ideal lah like this is the this is the minimum that I hope lah I just
um berharap like next time I I dapat macam work life balance lah orang cakap like
kerja pun I dapat dream job I I enjoy my work I boleh tolong orang like especially like if I can
become like a private sports err physiotherapist after I dah habis I punya bond dengan err hospital government hospital right and um
at that time I will look back and like I as an athlete like I did I sometimes and I need but like I tak tak cukup duit lah because this kind of service all can be quite expensive lah but I hope to be able to
tahap yang paling tinggi lah because like
bila dengan pertolongan daripada physiotherapy ni err you punya muscles semua like
boleh recover lah you punya recovery semua err lebih baik you you
jadi like
I tak dapat jadi I nak kasih orang lain untuk experience especially athlete athlete yang masih muda masih ada potential untuk
tak tahu lah mungkin boleh represent negara ke apa err ya like
that's that's the idealist scenario untuk saya lah like
bila I kerja pagi ke apa or mungkin I gym pagi err kerja sampai malam tengok lah then
but of course kalau I dah ada err orang lain dalam in my life lah like I have a girl then of course I need to you know like she'll probably be working also so
depending on our schedule lah but I will try of course try my best to make time for her you know maybe sekali seminggu just like we go out for like a date night or something like that just to maintain the relationship lah cause I feel like it's
kasih you punya masa kena sacrifice sikit lah untuk dia cause um
oh ya cakap pasal itu I forgot one of my passions is also to
err kayuh basikal lah jadi like
ideally if if my my working hours pendek sikit um
I boleh slot in masa untuk err girlfriend masa untuk err gym tapi juga untuk err cycling lah and
paling best kalau I ada satu kumpulan cycling macam like a cycling bukan maybe not like a very professional team like just like a cycling group lah then
like every maybe bila tak panas lah maybe
early morning ke err lewat malam ke then
we just you know ride around singapore together road cycling ah road cycling bukan err trail riding
dia memastikan yang I masih aktif lah bila I dah tua nanti
kerana gym mungkin after some time like bila dah tua err apa tu
you punya joints semua mungkin ada another problem lah tapi cycling
err dia punya risks tu rasa kurang sikit lah
you you ride a bike on the main road or jalan raya kan
I feel like err asalkan you it could err ikut peraturan jalan raya semua you follow the rules you just play safe lah you are you pakai lights all you are well seen and especially if you ride in group lah is safer cause you can or like look out for one another and you
I bukan nak masuk pertandingan ke apa I just like for casual for enjoyment like
untuk err general health and well-being sahaja lah but
it's a fun way lah for me untuk untuk dapat kan err
kerana gym
you punya cardiovascular health you punya jantung semua tu tak akan um
won't be trained as much lah tapi kalau nak buat cycling ke untuk you lari ke apa your
your this apa cardiovascular health will err naik ah you will improve boleh maintain semua
jadi um
err in the long run lah is aku rasa suatu yang penting tapi mungkin
err tak boleh dilakukan tapi kalau ideal scenario I nak lah kerana
each ride will take about what dua jam
so it's it's quite time consuming the sense cause kalau gym empat puluh minit you know you go in go out get it done
it's it's it's okay lah but err kalau cycling you kena gear up semua you
jumpa kawan and then you go for your ride it it takes a while lah and mungkin along the way sometimes we have like a pit stop just for coffee or whatever break you know just some minum slight makan just snacks then
foodpanda dah takde agaknya asal nak
oh you mean that time uh masa masa uh masa collect that time eh takde that time when I collect kan takde orang pun dah habis dah dia orang cakap ada seribu jer helmet
tengah cari bila ada masa pergilah susun cert cert sekolah dalam satu file jadi nanti kalau ada interview senang takde kelam-kabut nanti suruh ayah copykan cert sekolah tu

mm dia sebenarnya dia series macam wentworth gitu tapi dia main kat macam dia filem dua jam kelakar pasal series tu ada enam episode
ha cerita dia kalau nak tahu pasal bunuh-bunuh dia ada nicole kidman tapi bagus ah dia dia thriller cerita dia ah okay lah cerita sikit eh nicole kidman ni dia sebenarnya psychiatrist suami dia doctor untuk cancer uh untuk budak-budak so kirakan dia orang dua ni kaya ah lepas tu anak dia orang sekolah atas high satu hari tu ada budak baru masuk sekolah pakai scholarship budak tu bangsa sepanyol
jadi mak dia jadi kawan dengan nicole pasal
anak nicole pun sekolah situ kira macam antara dua darjat ah yang sepanyol tu miskin si nicole ni kaya pendekkan cerita
perempuan sepanyol tu kena bunuh teka siapa dia punya suspect
suami si nicole padahal nicole seorang jer kawan dengan dia
pasal si suami nicole tu ada affair dengan si sepanyol ni
tak habis tengok jadi kita tengok sendiri series tu uh pasal tu potong-potong so tak tahu lah apa jadi takde nak kena tengok online ah dia main kat jer so nak kena stream ah
uh patut tadi keluar habis hujan lebat gila
mm besok mungkin uh nak pergi uh beli beras tengok ah macam mana makan kat luar ah
uh belum tahu tengok cuaca
uh dia pergi memancing oh tapi tak jadi tak tahu ah tadi dia pergi tadi dia dah siap-siap tau lepas tu dia dia keluar lepas tu kejap lagi dia masuk balik lepas tu dia cakap uh gerimis lepas tu dia taruh balik the barang-barang pancing dia lepas tu kejap lagi dia duduk kat kerusi so tak jadi lah tu sebab tu dia kat situ
dia hantar kat kedai omar tadi uh uh petang tengah hari
a'ah sebelum hujan
cuci carburetor jer
oh full service dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri huh
ah tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah pass two A kan so dia nak bawa motor tu kan
uh ya by the way kan tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas uh actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee tau it's a good deal macam you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
ah see how lah if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers ke or I will buy the cinema vouchers
so dia punya is testing so so maksudnya dia uh
oh okay okay so kalau kalau nak apply macam uh position apa yang most slightly akan take your cert take uh takes graduates
rovers okay then kalau uh uh how macam mana boleh pakai cert tu untuk apply kalau boleh jadi apa
uh dekat uh poly macam ni ah the the normal the five poly's one of them so uh bayar ah ke oh diploma
oh bagus eh tapi tapi dia join dia join under uh full time staff or contract staff
contract tapi dia tolong untuk further studies oh that's good ya I think most likely dia dah dapat diploma dia akan take dia akan take
oh okay okay then uh ada apa-apa lagi tak kerja yang macam
mm bagus lah tu
kalau ah
okay lah tengok ah macam mana rezeki nanti try lah
apa tengok apa ada opening apa lagi
the the uh turkey right ya yang tujuh setengah tu jangan lupa so nak beli apa untuk alesya
for spark ke X one R
oh actually okay very simple okay untuk motor-motor uh spark atau motor X one R ni
takkan sentuh satu benda pun selagi tak bayar owner dia duit
so akan just naik jer
dua-dua uh under ayah punya nama bukan nama kita kereta jer so um
dia punya plan kan is uh dia punya plan uh kalau
uh dah ada motor yang bagus
ataupun kalau takde tapi nak naik yang ini so akan uh beli lah buy over so bayar ayah let's say X one R X one R worth berapa sekarang
okay so maybe bayar dia dua ribu beli beli dari dia okay okay ni just misalnya lah so kalau betul-betul nak buat something eh uh uh nak pakai X one R tu jadi spare and nak nak repair hantar kat rumah kan so kita nak kena bayar dia jadi kita nak keluarkan nama dia so akan bayar dia just like token ah I takkan bayar full sum okay motor not good condition so maybe dua ribu lepas tu uh baru hantar kedai baru akan taruh duit
so sekarang tak bagus jangan kacau apa-apa because motor tu takde nama takde full ownership so macam tu lah cerita dia so sekarang bila naik kan dia dia punya motor dah start bising tapi dia kata dah adjust
chain tapi tak tahu ah kena try lagi
sebab dia sebab dia bising apa ah
tengok ah macam mana so tu lah plan dia kenapa ada siapa-siapa minat bawa X one R atau nak betulkan berapa banyak motor nak ada ya tapi faham kan that means kalau sesiapa nak lumba
tahu tapi faham kan because selagi benda tu kita punya kita tak boleh ubah
nanti dia akan jadi part dua so nak buat apa-apa pun nak kena beli over itu motor atau at least letak duit jadi tutup story tu nanti lah dulu tengok kasih kita fikir because ada chance uh uh I prefer uh lagi suka nak beli motor uh apa nama dia
uh lupa lah nama dia uh no no bukan kapcai uh yang macam uh azri nak bikin tu apa nama dia ya tapi uh no two B two B tu kirakan uh dia kirakan bukan W two hundred kirakan nak beli yang siap dia dah bikinkan ah mm so kalau uh tu kan banyak pakai duit kan so kalau nak beli nak nak pakai duit untuk motr gitu then
takkan nak buat nak spend tu duit untuk motor motor kapcai gini
so uh sampai kita dah beli motor idaman uh jangan fikir langsung nak buat apa-apa dengan X one R ni
ya tu plan dia lah tapi
it's this um objective dia sama selagi motor tu ada tuan dia jangan pandai-pandai godeh kau siapa yang nak jawab
ya lah so tu jer lah cara dia uh kalau betul-betul nak kena beli jer ah jadi uh takde orang akan bising
itu jer lah
mm so uh bagus tak idea kita
boring tapi kalau kita dah ubah suai nanti kalau ada apa-apa masalah siapa yang nak tanggungjawab
mm fikir tapi okay lah nanti bayar dia dulu lah tengok lah
uh apa cerita dengan abang yang dekat hougang tu dia nak bawa uh dia nak dia dia masih nak bawa delivery tak
ke tu saja jer dia cakap apa dia cakap apa
ya then when you tell him that what did he say it was was he serious or he was just uh just berbual kosong
then um kenapa uh sekarang baru nak buat ni pasal dia selalu ada uh apa free time apa dia tapi dia kat rumah main game kenapa dia tak pergi buat this delivery job
so sekarang dia dah relax ah baru ada time
kurang lah
dia nak buat delivery ah
eh dah bilang dia nak kena bayar uh bag dia semua dia cakap apa
okay tapi tak cakap apa-apa pun senyap jer so maybe berbual kosong ah
tengok ah macam mana
eh oh okay nanti dia datang rumah tengok ah dia ada cakap pasal ni ke tak
so dia nak beli motor apa yang kat bawah tu
mm a'ah tak faham pasal uh bukan ke uh start topic ni cakap pasal dia nak kerja delivery so kalau dia nak kerja delivery kenapa nak pinjam duit untuk beli motor scrambler macam motor dia bawa dia patut pinjam duit untuk beli motor biasa motor kapcai hmm
tapi uh okay so kirakan takde link ah dengan delivery sekarang ni pasal dia nak ada link juga
nak dua ah delivery and also untuk dia
tapi dah dah bilang dia lah kalau nak bawa delivery pakai uh scrambler susah
so boleh nampak kan yang macam tak make sense kan oh uh tahu tak bila dia mati eh
tahun depan so that's why ya
then dia cakap apa kenapa kenapa dia terkejut
then dia cakap then dia cakap apa
ya jangan main-main bilang dia kalau dia buat benda ni dia akan kena boleh kena buang eh
tahu tapi tahu tak tu boleh jadi dia jangan jadi viral
ya lah so so kerja apa shift but ah by the way dah boleh kerja roo tau
dah boleh start kalau nak dia bayar bagus tau tadi sebelas dollar sepuluh
oh macam surcharge gitu ah oh
ya but I didn't uh tapi tak tahu tau yang dia naikkan dia punya docket pasal hujan ingatkan pasal distance pasal distance dia pun jauh juga
berbaloi uh apa um apa lagi eh ni deliveroo ya so dah boleh naik dah boleh uh log in dah
then ah grab pun dah boleh
tapi grab is lima dollar kalau satu trip deliveroo uh equals to tiga no uh dua trip grab
ya ya tapi tak tahu tahu uh the distance uh pasal that time roo punya is jauh
tapi jauh bukan jauh gila ah jauh macam jauh paya lebar
oh okay um sekarang I'm doing like part time um kerja part time so macam um I do some um actually doing financial advisory um ya at the same time doing um freelance freelance works ah ya um macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
ah no no no I'm actually singaporean but last time I had um indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
uh ya ya ya so actually um like last time my maid selalu um talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam I know how ya how to speak ya hmm
um actually it just baru baru start so macam um macam just had like briefing then uh so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
ya I think macam health actually quite important lah um ya I rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy lah for your good for your health and stuff like that
same lah sama sama ya is is I think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja oh so baru graduate also
oh drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
oh macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing lah
hmm so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between lah
mm dia mm okay I understand I see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common lah untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so I guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
mm actually good good that your boss macam I recognize that you you need to take a break then um then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me uh ya lah macam I work for dua tahun then lepas tu uh I tried dua company tapi macam uh at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that I that I face at both companies so I also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau I need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so I decided to macam take a break and then um from there I explored different different punya industry and then um at the same time I kerja part time then um macam trying to at the same time I explore lah whether I feel nak stay in this industry or I want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough lah one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya at least some more now macam it's COVID punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
it's something better than macam nothing right
ya ya ya I think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then I guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else I guess ya I'm start I'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new I guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang I'm I'm actually I'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi I I have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam jer then um ada assignment then um some project ya just learning new things I guess
oh the the webinar is actually uh era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so I guess that's good ya tapi those hmm tu actually untuk mid career adults lah macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so I just just took this opportunity to learn something new lah I guess ya
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home I don't understand
hmm okay I see I see I see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
hmm sounds very challenging lah macam susah so
ya so macam I told you I took a break from I I totally left my industry at the moment lah so I started taking um um I started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings um to to prepare us lah macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to um basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because I rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody lah so so I rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what I learn macam susah to macam convince people um to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process lah I'm I'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
hmm I macam baru start meeting clients that um uh there are some um potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that ah ya
so um other than that macam I think you what you said about um an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive um like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good I guess tapi macam I haven't actually um had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then um for the ya for the part time work ya I just started because I wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang I'm like not earning as much as last time I feel like more happy macam ya like I don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how I felt lah everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
ya I think it's common like macam I spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing lah ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job kan
so you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like oh is it difficult
I see I see okay then I will just I will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay um so um ya it's really macam it's I think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually I'm twenty I'm twenty six years old how about you
oh you are twenty only oh sorry sorry I'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me lah like because ya even though I'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy lah our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so I think ah macam syukur lah like I feel quite
mm I see ya I think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
you ada connections with like theatre punya um like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
um actually macam I just told him I am exploring something new lah while because like at the same time also um learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while I take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by united so macam I'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
then I feel I mean because I I don't depend on him for anything lah like I can pay for my own things like I ada savings and that kind of thing so I mean he is he's okay with that lah like he kind of like supportive I guess ya
but I guess like ada ada like I guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
ya I think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace lah it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar hmm
hmm oh you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time um I rasa like while we're still young important to save also lah saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since I was young kan I always believe in saving then macam I am quite thrifty lah macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like I made sure to to have enough savings lah so that on a rainy day I won't feel the pain so hard ya
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
oh but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun lah like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right hmm
ya tapi you can just tell her later kan like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
tapi ada notice period tu semua lah
oh kenapa
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
okay actually I ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then I think she did the conversion but I don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her I can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause I think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she I think she's okay I'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her I will tell her that that that I have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then I think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right I am also a shy person so I don't really like asking I don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience lah then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
ya I would link you I would link you I would link you up later then at least macam lah like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay I really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry lah then at least you roll one out
so actually I met her from um like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
I don't know I think macam I'm I I I before I do things I put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like I was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then I was like okay I had enough nowadays I need I need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand lah like my work was difficult lah like I was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
at the same time macam as in like I said lah because I had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important lah like like what I'm telling you cause like you're younger right
so that I know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like I know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what I'm doing lah ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what I'm doing lah like take a break and not work kind of thing
oh probation ah macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
no but your contract said you have so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if I were you I would have fought
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
oh only one kakak lah
huh sorry oh see I see okay ya I'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common lah
so um I hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
yes yes yes I agree ya I agree that hmm that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right I've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like I think think you can't do that if I'm sure you can do that at F&B too
a lot of things ya a lot of things changed lah I mean um I mean my habits and err routines banyak dah tukar ya so especially sekarang kena work from home so that sort of things that you have to adapt to yourself ya
so so nak tanya sikit so you rasa this COVID right have err actually changed you to be a better person ke you rasa macam COVID is such a you know is making your life difficult
ya the good thing now you boleh spend time dengan parents you kan like you know more more time to get home you know daripada keluar because there's not much to do outside and and you cannot kita tak boleh travel so there's a lot of restrictions going on ya
so sekarang you have a new skill lah you the pro lah kan when it comes to like designing
boleh buat poster lah ni you know like marketing advertising okay not bad uh that's interesting okay
yes ya last time I feel like err it's such a waste I'm repaying every month untuk for netflix then sekarang macam it's a good thing I'm subscribing it and I'm utilizing the
ya or probably do some activities like err cycling you know ya probably I mean err tentative now the weather has you know ah you tahu lah kan weather dia sekarang nak hujan
hujan sekejap you know panas so I'm not sure if cycling is a good activity to do this weekend but it's just err tentative plan
oh really dekat dekat town is it bali lane okay
I should I should try ah I should pergi and you know mesti mesti weekends long queue kan and there's a lot of um
jadi dia tak macam ya they block the seats lah okay
okay true tak tahu eh sekarang ada movie apa yang best I mean dah lama juga tak check online usually now because we prefer to watch it online jadi um for us to go physically to the cinema macam
cause you punya orang suka advance planning is it ya and also you kerja shift kan and also pasal your um off days
I I I also prefer um cause I have a schedule so I actually like it when um someone make plans in advance so macam teratur sikit your you know your week for the week so ya
kalau orang buat advance planning err
kalau orang buat advance planning and then err you know suddenly they screw up or they couldn't make it and especially kalau kita plan big um occasions or err you know like err birthday parties or anything then lepas tu cancel it will be very hard you know
I mean if if you don't like something you upfront about it err you know I mean if you keep it to yourself then I I somewhat later I I found out about it I'll be very marah you know I'll be like very angry or like why are you not honest kenapa you tak just you know admit things that you you don't like
so that's one thing that I'm very particular about like err because like maybe it's not a good thing kalau you terlalu upfront atau terlalu honest but I believe that if you don't like something ya
ya because I I don't want to like keep things and then you simpan or kalau let's say you marah and then you you keep things to yourself then
uh but you you still not happy about it so you you know macam it doesn't goes well you know I really prefer ya to be honest and let it out about your feelings
so that um you know there's no macam terasa hati that kind of thing
ya lama kenal and then still keep in touch with err it use to be my primary school friend but then as we
instagram or social media ya because err most most of them are married with kids so macam they're busy dengan activity dia orang while
for me like you know I'm still I'm single so it's like I have more time so nak ajak dia orang keluar semua susah so now the best way is to communicate through social media
that's good that's good okay ya that I mean even though um you know tak boleh jumpa and all but the best thing is like at least keep in touch keep in contact tanya khabar you know that's a very good thing
uh ya macam mana you tahu
um playing on my err playlist these few months ever since err COVID has been you know going on so I discover new music um suka um I if I I like one music maybe I'll play a couple of times kalau suka the same music then I'll just have the same
tengah hujan but I know that you are the opposite right you suka loud music kan you don't like macam cooling cooling
for someone who's introvert then suka loud music ya
instrumental as in ada orang nyanyi ke is there anyone singing the music or just the playing instrument
ah tu itu kalau untuk tidur best eh
so I dengar by the way err you recently just start up a small business
kan uh macam yang
oh okay uh apa tu what's that
so macam mana you dapat the idea of um starting up that um small business of yours
so err berapa lama you dah you know venture into this small business
ya betul true
so um now that um you dah venture this err for the trial semua for three months so err what are some of the obstacles that err you actually face throughout macam err susah that you had to struggle along the way just for this business is there anything
actually this is a really a from what I heard from you punya explanation tadi kan I think this is such a good um way you know to to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you
to start up like you know anyway you pun masih muda and then err I I think that is very creative you know the idea that is coming from you and then are you doing this alone or you ada team lain macam
that's good so but but then you are they're also working full time right dia orang pun kerja
mm if you're if you are talking about business um ya there's a few things err on my mind yang I lama lah actually plan out you know like one of them was like doing a set up leather sandals you know that I was planning to create a project err to help you know to actually um
kind of like support um like err you know small err other businesses that can help me to err create a a leather sandal so at the same time I'm supporting them and at the same time they are also helping me err to create err the leather sandals as per what I request yang I suka
err tapi at the same time err that this project is like the money will be going to err those in need is not for my own profit that's one of the project yang I tengah tengok
but then sebab sekarang tengah pandemic so I um um venture out and actually look at the quality and all to um the stuff
err I need to be kat sana physically to be there you know so it's kind of hard to communicate through ya on the phone so that kind of project I need to put on hold dulu lah so I tak boleh I cannot err
through err communication through err whatsapp pun it's very hard cause everything will be sent through pictures and you pun touch the material the quality ya so all these macam err I don't know like pandemic has um kind of like err stop err a lot of um my plans you know ya
so I'm trying to be as positive as possible hoping that maybe next year things will get better for us you know kita boleh travel and
and you know err the economy pun kat other countries err affected kan like err because we have been travelling to support like
other countries you know to to support um you know when as we travel um like like for example malaysia kita semua pergi err to buy things ya all this now sekarang kita tak boleh we cannot go over
mahal ya and everything kind of like limited if you notice macam sometimes you nak look at look out for your stuff tapi dah habis ya people tend to stock up a lot
all this like macam kind of like err a bit difficult for us to travel around and um to look out for things that macam susah nak dapat you know nowadays cause everything um macam senang aje is very easy err to to sold out so you have to
err you know order online you know get it from other country purchase kat you know from other countries and err get it delivered here in singapore so this is like kind of a big challenge but at the same time it makes us you know um be stronger as err you know as a country as a as together
so anyway err okay let me ask you something okay kalau sekiranya
kalau sekiranya err um flight dah buka lah the the the the plane is you can start to buy tickets to go anywhere so the first thing you nak pergi where would you want to go in your mind what's in the first thing on your mind
really you nak pergi morocco
macam dah lama lah it it's on your mind that you want to
oh you dah pergi you have been to norway so you went
kalau macam new zealand ke you know that kind of place orang selalu buat road trip kan you know like new zealand australia that kind of place orang selalu might sewa like err rent a caravan kan or
or do some road trip and um do some macam camping camping punya style lah kan compared to it's not a city vibes punya kind of
so it kalau macam gini you cannot err bring your parents lah kan do you think it's a good place to bring like elderly
ya and also like macam accessibility into halal you know the the food all and
um places to macam err to go to toilet all these kind of things you have to consider because maybe err the elderly might not err err feel that err comfort they they won't feel comfortable to to you know
stay imagine like you know when when you bring your parents to stay in a caravan kind of vibe I tak rasa they might you know they will like it because it's um something new tapi untuk dia orang nak masak ke nak makan they have their own preference kan kalau you notice
because I've experienced before macam err even though my mum is um she likes to travel juga lah kan she's okay with thing we can see that at the end of the day
she will still bring her like macam food lah she's not open to try the food from other countries she will still bring like macam maggi or whatever that is from singapore itself
or macam sambal you know err her own comfort food lah dia still akan prefer that compared to macam to venture out and try all the different kinds of err
food from the country that we are heading to so dia tak akan really macam kalau makan pun sikit aje
just a bit so dia tak akan macam into it
so kalau for me myself when I travel I would love to
ya correct that's why like they always pair err apa on standby they will bring err like sambal on the go you know to correct ya
ya interesting cause we err we get to you know like when you travel with your friends and when you travel with your err family or parents the the experience is different because maybe uh there's a lot of things that macam
might occur you know like um how the pace of how you want to travel the places you nak pergi you kena consider maybe parents not you know not okay with the places that you nak pergi tapi kalau dengan friends you are more flexible there's lot of things that you can do together
ya so macam it it it's something um you know sometimes when I nak travel pun I will consider like should I bring my mum along or um okay lah tempat ni maybe I err just bring my friends you know because of the places that I want to go back but maybe my mum would not um
see the volcano err dekat indo something kan nak naik err the gunung but my mum say that oh tak boleh it's very dangerous you know but my friends will be like hey that's interesting you know ya but we check all the safety precautions err precautions and such tapi my mum will still think that tak boleh you know
ya true ya ya semua tanggung dengan parents
okay um I just love snow okay I suka winter even though
good experience for me to err to finally dapat rasa you know how how it feels like because before this I've never been to any western countries and yang ke mana-mana yang ada snow
so bila I dapat experience snow tu I was like a bit jakun lah then I was like a bit like wow snow and then err at one point I was like okay it's getting too cold ya the the weather was so bad sampai negative the temperature was really bad ya but um
suddenly I was like okay I I cannot stand it I was like okay I'm so glad that um you know I'm staying in singapore cause singapore panas pun panas but I don't have to suffer compared when I was in sejuk dia macam one kind ya
but um still I I suka snow because of I can main I can play with the snow and then err and then the the the season like the vibes um
winter is like towards end of the month I mean end of the year sorry err so dia macam the feeling dia to christmas lagi-lagi macam so you build a snowman you know all these kind of things so I I to be honest even until now
cause like winter kan that's when the only time you boleh pakai thick jackets and then you can
you know you can wear like all the pullovers yang all the seluar kat singapore you tak boleh you know you cannot wear them so this is like a good I always think that way like this is like a good time for me to wear all the boots you know during winter
look different ya but then um ya kind of like waste after that I don't know what to do with the my my all all my jackets semua I tak tahu
it's not appropriate to be to be worn here ya so but now the worst thing is err pandemic so plus points still cannot travel so all these um jackets I'm not sure what should I do with it like should I jual ke you know
or should I buang you know ya
I would really err want to I really nak one thing that I really nak pergi after this err one place sorry err would be japan ya
I've been trying to err but then I heard a lot of things like macam mahal juga lah their their you know like to travel I don't I'm not sure maybe bila pergi japan you pernah pergi kan
korea dengan japan ada ada beza tak what do you think
I think we singaporeans kena belajar eh from them basic manners
I just want to try the train kalau to get to experience dekat japan you know like where the they have bullet train ya bullet train ya
ya I I heard a lot about err pasal japan and the culture and the food and I mean I I heard good food err I mean um that japan has a lot of good food tapi macam when it comes to the
price wise and to travel I heard like it's quite costly but I really want to visit tokyo though like um ya macam tokyo is like one of my destinations that I've been wanting to to to go
maybe next time maybe you can bring me since you dah pernah pergi err japan kan
last time kita tak appreciate err buat travelling kan kita selalu err feel that okay anytime boleh pergi you know next time lah next year but then sekarang when it's really like macam stop us from travel
the feeling is like macam oh all these while especially kalau pasal gambar macam like let's say kita dah frequent pergi that country
ah tak payah lah ambil gambar ah tak payah pergi you know then all these memories macam oh no it's wasted macam sayangnya kalau tahu aku ambil gambar that kind of thing
anything that you nak tanya I
afraid of insect does it count you know even like the small thing small insect like err small spider or semut sometimes I can be like you know
I I tak nak pegang I don't want to I don't want to kill it tak tak nak you know even though kita pakai tissue to throw it to angkat kan ya I'll be like tak nak you know just scared
cicak you know like lizards all these ya
I think it's it's stupid lah because orang cakap like dah mati apa for example especially when it's dead kan then dah mati apa so like just just angkat lah but I still like no I got that fear and
because maybe because um kalau you naik plane then kan ada clouds like covering so you tak nampak tau bawah sangat
and you are in a macam covered closed like you're inside the plane what so tak you tak exposed sangat you know to look down tapi kalau let's say it's a
macam you nak kena jump from a high a high building or something err you have to look down kan so probably for me I'll be very scared to do that but I guess you are you're not right from the way I look at you I think you are adventurous
actually err when I was in hong-kong kan I was scared of cable car ya sorry that was side track err I was in hong-kong so err I naik this err cable car tau you know the three hundred sixty so it's like full glass
so it's err so you boleh nampak bawah your kaki can look through kat bawah so I thought that it's just a normal cable car impossible that I'll be scared naik cable car biasa boleh apa but then when I took the three hundred sixty cable car it was like
you kind of distract because you can see everything so it's all clear and you feel that you going to macam jatuh the feeling
so I guess ya even you naik luge kan you kan dia macam open luge as in the apa yang the skyride tu yang dekat sentosa
ah ya correct that one itu pun macam open apa ya your legs dangling so macam
that one also I won't dare to macam ambil ambil video ambil gambar cause I scared that you know it might drop
so ya so my afraid of heights thing macam is kind of critical ah I feel tapi orang cakap it's quite silly lah but to me it's like it's something that I'm scared tapi orang lain probably they they find it like it's just heights you know
oh so where where did the spider tu apa lari then pergi somewhere like left or you had to kill it you kena bunuh
actually is is that the spider yang you tahu kaki dia like tipis ke ke dia
tapi kan ada kaki yang spider yang tipis ada yang very
I'm so glad like macam kalau singapore tak you you know tak macam sangat lah you know masuk spider but then if you are in kalau macam summer um season that's when the spiders um start to appear in in your house
so they start to masuk because maybe I think it's a it's a great weather to be in but
kalau let's say for example I suruh you err go and pick up a cockroach yang dah mati you boleh lah just use your bare hands angkat macam gitu
just like that angkat kaki dia ke orang boleh you know just
ee antenna okay I mean you boleh angkat macam gitu with your bare hands oh no
speaking of insects kan so err what do you think about orang-orang yang err actually eat eat insects like what what do you think like err is it okay to if let's say someone were to ask you to eat you boleh ke makan cambodian for example they ya they are like kind of into insects
so they it's it's not the same as where you found the insect outside you know macam it's not the the same kind of insect so they kind of clean and I don't know lah what where they found those kind of insect
only if they actually boil it first so it like it it it can macam at least the texture of the the dia punya shell macam edible I don't I don't know how they do it because
pork is part of their you know macam culture they like to eat ya
but I know I can see that you are an android user you pakai samsung so that's so how do how do you what do you think about um samsung
front camera ke atau yang back the back camera
dia punya music dia kan
ya ada yang baru punya you know the the flip phone is it err samsung ya I I saw that it looks kind of cool you know you can just
flip your phone and then like very compact you boleh letak dalam bag you what do you think of that
the middle part tu lah the screen punya macam
quite a lot for iphone you know and then bila they they start to have like ah tak ada charger err you have to buy different kind of you know the the cable now is like a bit different right if you notice kalau you tengok dia punya
bahagian at the top part I think it's different I mean I mean not the top part but as in maybe the the the charge itself I can see the difference with the old err ya the cable wire ya so it's like um
ya ya correct correct so you nak beli the head tu you kena beli a specific a different one ya anyway it's been a great time I got to go you know err I need to you know I'll get back to work so it's it's been a nice time to catch up with you err so kalau nanti free you just
hey sorry I know I came I'm supposed to come like an hour earlier but I came timing gini
yeah tapi like luckily I got like direct bus ah I mean it's a long bus ride but it was a nice long bus rides

she's kind of like she lives in a kampung right then she just like gave birth and then like
tak ada duit like the only source of income was like
from her husband then macam like baby tak ada duit then the other time
we called her during raya the baby tengah demam seh
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like kita like very rapat dengan dia
bila raya right like dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri you know like I mean
if they live in you have to stay in then after that like you like for raya you cannot balik kampung which is like
their bandar is right so like their family members are all back in like kampungs and stuff
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because uh during like hari raya like that time
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like pocong just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers lah you know macam they dress up macam pocong gitu habis just to like
scare cause like malam malam kan dekat
dekat hutan semua tu so macam like it scared them and then like
patah balik sia I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
I think they did tried to do the same kat indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west gitu
it's all pakai laptop eh
like you pakai laptop then like it's just what like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like kenapa tak buat
you know like kenapa tak buat
err tak tak tak tolong mak or something like that you know so I'm just like
I told you kan like the day before I pergi err the malayan council
then err you know portion dia orang kan besar kan so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like mahal kan
then uh he's like okay so I just met him and then like kita lepak
sekejap I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to panjat you know cause like
also then after that like at night I went to like jumpa kawan you know just to lepak also
I don't know there's this thing called the the rendang daging salai or something
it taste like you know the kuah is sort of like rendang then with linguine with like scallops
sotong and then there's like daging salai on top lah which is like I don't know
really sedap lah it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out tapi for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about rendang being the nicest but
tak sedap you know everything is sedap
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause macam like tak ramai orang
so macam especially with the whole COVID thing I pun like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's sedap you know and then like
pre pre COVID lah they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels gitu
I mean it is arab street lah everything there is like mahal and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
ayam madura which is like oh yeah
ayam geprek you know something like that like very indonesian based
but it's just a bit leceh cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
I don't know I use you know like kat Telegram they have those macam groups kan then macam
you know they mention things like for example like oh they never mentioned the pay like berapa or just like
oh you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then macam like
benda gini all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there what
habis dia orang tak ni so I was just like
yeah and then it's like macam cause like sometimes like
at least tak payah you know terfikir fikir you know kalau dapat ke tak
don't tell you the full truth then macam like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
akan lama gini you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay lah macam
but I thought like okay lah like lama lama pun maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most apa apa boleh makan kat luar jer tapi still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
so that stupid idiot of a president cakap kan like
like the president cakap lah and then the next day
really ada orang ni seh like actually drank bleach and stuff
mm tapi macam like a bit
that this like donald trump like macam dia punya priorities is just not
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already tengah COVID
so I feel so macam kasihan for them lah that they have such a bad president like this
common at all you know like so kasihan huh
hey that's not bad I mean like no offence lah but for an average melayu you know it's
okay lah like you know you cannot expect much from orang melayu lah honestly sorry but yeah
you know reciprocate also it's a bit like sakit hati
kau tahu macam boring seh like
cakap lah benda interesting you know I received a joke once like
cinta like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate dulu ah
habis like macam for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
from the second you match ada like
dua puluh empat jam for you to uh respond then like
no I think it's macam like concept baru because macam like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
like wipey mat melayu sort of things like you'll actually find like
so macam
err there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff tapi now I don't know lah I mean like cause
cause like Din Tai Fung sana kan halal right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always naik like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year tak dapat pergi it feels so weird you know cause like
normally when I go to I get very like jelak because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
tapi like
this year tak dapat pergi it's just like I want to go back
I thought halal tapi tak halal then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not halal in singapore
but I was from a wedding tu I like
I came in like my kebaya so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
me and my cousins all nak cabut because like
cousins so it's like rapat but
not very rapat
going for like jemputans and stuff like that pasal macam like when growing up gitu
macam I don't know I'm like very rimas cause macam panas kan then you have to like dress up semua and then like
pergi ah wedding tapi tak kenal siapa you know then macam I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore tapi I do enjoy if it's like
then you talking about the biryani like I think it's always a star of the show right then um
satu kali that time uh my my aunt I think
just I just decided to go lah because like macam I was I I know her what
then she kahwin
the biryani was just like next level
so like tak payah makan for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like kasi kita bawa balik then like got the ayam masak merah then the nasi minyak and all that
okay okay nasi biryani would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like nasi minyak
then like rendang and ayam masak merah that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
like from ah um you know ikan tiga rasa like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be biryani and stuff like that's so weird
who like got married like during like the second week of raya and I feel like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very pantang you know cause I feel like I'm from a
then like to have a wedding macam like no offence ah tapi macam like spoil seh
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just kahwin like or something you know
I mean like why why do people do it buat penat jer cause like normally like
people are just more tired during ramadhan you know and then like
kejar maghrib and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's terawih and stuff like that I think this
ah tapi I
ah I think recently they uh naikkan to maybe I think fifty
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then macam bigger honeymoon lah kirakan tapi macam
I'm also like the first child right so macam I feel like I understand my parents point macam dia nak you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know kalau tak
invite satu like if I invite like sikit sikit tu I don't want like dia orang sakit hati ke apa
tengok lah macam mana if anything also just like kahwin sikit sikit then like you know like
you know so macam like a lot of like the kampung kampung roots are still in within my family
so macam like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know macam gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
silat thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I pengantin apa like it's like I will be pengantin once in my life only what so macam like
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like panas cause like
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like budak kecil all can like run around
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super geli and it's so merepek cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
you know macam like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
I thought about it like australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like dah banyak
singaporeans there's banyak asians then like you know the whole like kiasu thing going on
so I think to myself just like you know okay lah then mat salleh at least I know I got chance to be the top right tapi like
dengan asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
nak migrate like like you said lah with the whole like tradition
uh like you know it's like very like new like you dah biasa with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
like I've also been called like celup lah like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you dengan your melayu
gitu but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
no lah I feel like it's also important cause macam like it's just like your self identity juga apa then like
I feel like at least in singapore also macam like the malay community is like
rapidly macam the language is dying you know I feel like
personally because macam like okay lah like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in bahasa err in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
it's just different lah macam like melayu sini the standard macam lower you know then macam a lot of people like just
dah tak tahu pakai like they don't really speak
then also macam like some of them like don't even know how to cakap you know
so yeah lah then like macam a lot of like little like ah traditional things are like dying too
like macam like anyam ketupat you know macam like
my family ah bila raya we still make it a thing lah macam every year we still do it you know and it's like
sedih ah because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable err like memory ah you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of raya and I feel like for me
holidays just like I mean like hari raya and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know buat kuih raya and like ayam ketupat and like just like getting already getting the house like raya ready
macam best ah like you know but like

of course penat lah tapi kakak ada macam learn untuk menjadi seorang yang berdikari
um dekat kerja kakak belajar untuk uh apa selalu ada keyakinan diri um
um saling bantu bantu membantu antara satu sama lain uh haruslah komunikasi sebagai pasukan kerana uh apabila kita err ingin melakukan kerja bekerjasama
kami haruslah berkomunikasi supaya kami tahu uh uh dan dan dan kerja kita akan jalan dengan lancar yup
um kadang-kadang ada jugalah ada ada yang kadang-kadang rasa macam mereka lebih tahu
lebih lebih apa macam mereka lebih tahu lah and then ingin menunjuk-nunjuk
ah tapi ah saya tidak apa ni uh kerana mereka rasa begitu kerana mereka takut um mereka rasa ditepi diketepikan semasa bekerja then ya um tetapi
mereka juga um um ada juga merupa bakat yang sangat bagus lah mereka dah sudah mahir dalam bidang itu ya
um selalunya ada ah contoh seperti kadang-kadang aku terlambat ah masuk kerja ah
ah saya pernah terjatuhkan uh apa ni
terjatuhkan cupcake batter di lantai
uh and then habis kotor di lantai ah and then saya haruslah mop
um yang apa yang saya telah berselerakkan eh apa ni um
saya pun juga pernah tidak mengikut arahan err kerana semasa kawan kerja saya err

selepas berapa minit kemudian saya apa uh uh bila saya tengah buat kerja saya masing-masing saya
terlupa err yang saya sudah apa membakar cupcake itu di dalam oven saya tidak mendengar saya saya tidak mendengar timer dan ia hangus
err then saya saya amat terperanjat dan juga berasa serba salah kerana sudah membazir cupcake itu
uh uh kawan kerja saya ah
err terkejut juga then menegur saya uh supaya uh saya tidak melakukan kesilapan itu lagi
ah betul kakak telah uh mempelajari untuk mengikut arahan dan jangan bertindak uh sendirian jika tidak pasti kerana kadang-kadang kita apabila kita rasa kami kita
um mungkin kakak ingin err belajar dalam bidang mengajar uh early childhood kerana saya suka berbual dengan uh anak-anak kecil dan juga ingin mengongsi err ilmu yang saya telah pelajari
err pernah satu incident apabila saya di kedai sedang ingin sedang menunggu
sedang apa um mengambil air sambil menunggu saya ternampak seorang budak sedang memain dengan bottle like yang
ia ingin flip bottle itu then
mahu uh ingin bottle itu uh berdiri dan budak itu um err melihat saya dan ingin mengimpress saya dengan dia punya skills then saya saya hanya senyum dan melihat uh adik itu dan um
uh mengatakan syabas kepada dia like good job because dia dapat flip bottle itu dan dia dia berusaha berusaha sehingga dia dapat stand bottle itu
um ya um apa apabila uh
anak anak kecil err um senyum ketawa saya gembira
um memang betul uh susah nak jaga budak-budak kecil sebab kita pun dulu budak-budak kecil tapi kalau kita orang
dah minat dengan err example bidang early childhood um
uh kita haruslah apa um kalau kita ingin tahu macam mana nak jaga anak-anak kecil ini kita boleh belajar dalam bidang early childhood kita belajar untuk uh cara untuk handle um budak-budak kecil ini
dengan but apabila sudah banyak kali uh practice err training
err cara tahu cara technique untuk berbual dengan anak-anak kecil uh yang agak mudah mudah juga
ya um sama seperti ibu bapa juga sebab uh jika we jika kita mengatakan uh mereka
err ada anak then dia orang apa kena um mengatasi masalah itu juga err untuk menghandle anak mereka
um teknologi boleh menjadi err boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah err yang faedah dia
macam dalam pelajaran uh um cikgu boleh memberi assignment kepada murid-murid um err contohnya kalau ada E learning
um anak-anak muda um
murid um dari dari um muda mereka senang untuk catch up um their skills especially in technology
mereka senang untuk uh belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah
dan mereka juga boleh err learn new skills from the internet because um but
yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini err ialah social media um mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan
err perkara yang di luar yang trend yang yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri
err contohnya seperti uh ada seorang celebrity
mereka melakukan trend uh yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan
ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya um tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya
err dengan itu saya rasa social media err technology haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin
ah untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna technology dengan baik mereka uh uh techonology ialah perkara um it's a safe platform for them
um ya kakak ingat dulu bila kita kecil um kita dulu kita orang uh
usually entertain diri sendiri dengan menggunakan komputer dan ada ada game permainan di komputer dan kami err main sebanyak mungkin ia juga agak menarik
err tetapi uh kami sebab kami
err ada adik-beradik kan uh kami kena ambil giliran
dan kadangkala kami gaduh pasal err giliran siapa untuk memain game di komputer
kami juga um uh di kami melihat err cerita dalam err pada zaman dahulu lah tapi zaman sekarang uh kami tidak pakai lagi kami boleh tengok online saja
ia memudah untuk generasi muda sekarang um ya

tapi kau kat dekat sana kau tak puas so instead you go for the whole singapore
and lina pula be like why you doing this who will kill me
apa eh

jap aku nak adjust aku punya
the doctor said that because I went to check out from my eyes what the doctor cakap tau apa is because aku rabun too much then the skin is lose then the muscle is weak so what I have to do is
rendang kenapa seh
tapi kalau you makan rendang selalu like wouldn't you get like too sick of it
like kalau for me kalau I makan rendang hari hari or like
it's like jelak seh
tapi I don't like I don't like to makan
to me kalau nak makan rendang kan
just makan dengan ketupat je
I don't like serunding
no lah I don't like serunding
okay with rendang but I don't like serunding
wah if I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life I rasa kan
a bit a bit susah leh
I think ayam lemak cili api
ayam lemak cili api or kari ayam
kari ayam hm
kari ayam kari ayam if my mom masak
because because right wah her kari ayam is
kari ayam power gila babe is power gila like dia punya pedas is just nice abih makan dengan sambal belacan then
dengan nasi oof
power gila ah
I think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
mee mee dalam ee like
lemak cili api other than that what what do you want to eat
dia punya tarik abih dia punya daging dia punya lah soft punya lah
banyak you know dorang bagi banyak abih dorang punya soup pun like sendu gila is it sendu
macam oof macam sedap like
no macam
thick is it thick like tebal
pekat ah pekat
sendu is it sendu or seru
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like ah like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
I think right for me right wah I don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan oh my god kalau kalau like any if I see this minah eh this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
eh punya lah ee macam nak
macam nak lempang je seh
like I want to hit her I want to like ee like ee can you not be so gedik a not
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world lah world lah macam
macam world lah
like dorang macam they're like
ah ah ah macam dorang bebual terus macam eh aku aku like aku pernah seh pergi kat sini pernah seh do this do that macam like
oh I got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
ah macam macam big macam world ah world haprak gitu ah
cuba try cuba try
oh macam dia macam like oh like like ah ape tu
macam like I'm better than you tapi actually tak lah tak lah better sangat
macam I more better but then actually you not that better lah
kita party lah sia
I think kita
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
what do we do I rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing I think we will achieve our dreams ah
I think that is for sure macam
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
buat hal masing masing ah
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what I would say
tak ada makna ah gitu
macam tak ada makna meaningless lah
tak ada challenges ah
basically time lah I think yang the most issue for my
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like oh nothing but to me I rasa macam twenty four is like oh my god I don't have time anymore you know I have like six more years until thirty and then what am I supposed to do next I mean I kena kahwin kena beli rumah
to me the only factor that I rasa that I'm losing right that I'm risking is
failures and time because I don't think that I have the time to macam
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah lah to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang dah macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
buat ni semua like
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang lah it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try ah apa lagi ah engineering abih lepas itu
you don't know you nak buat apa
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
betul juga ah betul juga ah
what you say ada ada sense
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish I rasa I would be eternally rich
so I can beli anything that I want
macam at least macam treated as human beings lah
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically I just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
but the thing is memang betul lah darjat wanita dah naik kan memang tinggi lah di islam tapi
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang dah besar pun
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because ah suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need lah because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow lah if you mampu ke tak betul tak
uh ideal matches to be kahwin
must be soft spoken must be so macam
at the same time you know I'm glad that like you know I went over there macam like
yeah I like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam eh kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun one
kita kena macam as merepek ah tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat ah
so kirakan I can masak any makanan that I want
entah eh
right right I think so too I think I will be like but the thing one thing I don't let is to ikut recipe
I for me I don't really macam I tengok recipe I look at the ingredients but I don't macam ikut one tablespoon
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing I tak ikut
you know I mean agak agak is like fun leh it's like oo you know you are making a portion or you like making something like oh it's a hit and miss like oh if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time I know that I have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble it's like a to me it's like macam like that time I masak sambal tumis telur eh sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
buat sambal tumis tapi kan tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so I decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important lah basically
so I use garlic and I put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much lah because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then I did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that I tengah masak kan
and then I was just like I feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so I letak sugar and then it was like uh
so I put then I put kicap and then I put uh it was like a it was like a frenzy ah it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
I just I just whatever I can think of right I just campak kat dalam
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
I can cook any rendang you want rendang johor rendang penang rendang sarawak
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
rendang and yes I want uh the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know
ugh serious nye

yeah I kena santau abih lepas tu I tak ada mood apparently my mum said I was someone else then I diam je then my mum belikan makan I didn't even touch it I didn't even eat it then mum hold me ah she felt like my body was ice cold
and then she was like like she baca baca all this
apparently after we left after we leave the punya mall right then then I was okay already then I rasa lapar then I feel like want to eat
then my mum was like okay lah let's go eat dekat kedai makan yang kat bawa like some
macam sikit sikit/malay lah like
where mummy masak me birthday for my sixteenth sixteenth birthday
because like mummy right she only masak bila birthday for the rest of my sisters
but my birthday right she always masak macam sotong

how come never masak me birthday then I ask ah mummy never masak me birthday for me ah
then she say you you want you nak is it then I cakap ya

tak sanggup tak sanggup one is enough
yeah I think gila seh
tak ada orang yang boleh ambil dia ah like tak ada orang boleh defeat dia ah even thanos you know even thanos like start ask the army to rain down
apart from rendang if you talking about like metaphorically
kalau if you talking about food I think I will get uh kari ayam
I already say kan
kalau metaphorically I think right I'll get
a bit too sassy lah macam that's why I think people don't like
like macam macam okay a bit world ah I guess
no lah but it's more of like okay like arrogance as as in macam
entah eh arrogance as if like I'm a bit too over confident
entah eh
merepek lah what you mean intimidating you not intimidating at all lor
no as in macam is not even like you not even intimidating lorh
yeah I'm I'm talking about macam or you talking about work ah

it's fucking lawa
so if I wear fluffy sleeve I will look more lawa
show off to me aku nak tengok
okay then kalau terlampau besar bagi aku jer lah
men's punya sweaters cause it looks much more nicer rather than the girl's one
why apa
this thing boleh mampus ah nak buat
eh you punya kasut lawa though
okay ah you buy kau beli yang ni tapi yang tu kau bagi kat aku
alah tak best ah kau
okay besok datang rumah aku ah

do you want me check out the yuzu punya pie is nice the like the cream pie but I don't know aku tak rasa lah
so besok kau datang rumah aku
we lepak
no cause dia half chinese that's why she look like you
eh come ah tomorrow besok kau datang rumah aku aku cut kau punya bangs tapi aku buat gini
aku pakai razor
but I aku tak tahu macam mana nak cut gitu tau like I see they do on tiktok right but I don't know how they do
alah bagi fifteen minute lagi lah
dia tak nak layan ah she don't want to layan you
no lah kau besok kau datang rumah aku lah wei aku buatkan engkau
eh aku tunjuk
ya yang kau cakap aku nasi padang tu yang sedap tu habis

alah gitu pun ada
I don't know lah where they want to go I just ikut jer
so tomorrow what's the plan kau datang rumah aku kau belajar lepas tu kita makan
oh kalau tak accepted habis dia tak bayar eh
okay that's the thing cause if you asking about my dreams cita-cita saya nak pergi ke australia untuk continue my studies which actually I was supposed to do but then I did not cause family time I was thinking about keluarga masa dengan keluarga sangat important
pasal kalau ibu um susah sangat kalau dia nak lepaskan saya cause saya anak yang paling last
so for ayah
ayah is quite easy you know
you know but like when I was supposed to go saya not supposed to come back for like two or three years that's why you know the risk of family time is important to me so that's the thing that's the answer for that
so tak boleh yang typical macam invisible
oo tu susah
okay awak awak jawab dulu
okay awak nak jadi macam spy kids lah
mmhmm masukkan makanan dalam oven terus boom dah siap is it
awak tak sangka kan tu jawapan saya saya tahu saya tahu
iya lah
as you got wow now after we think ya masa tengah fikir ni
allah ada timing eh okay
ten years ago saya dapat jumpa sekarang
kan yang benda tu dapat jumpa sekarang okay
ya pasal saya suka collect gambar-gambar lama
ya sama macam ibu collect collect collect
mm tiga belas ya
saya tengah secondary one
a'ah macam jer cause
ah cause after second year third year habis
sama-sama lah kita macam
nak buat kawan susah lah
tak buat apa-apa pun ya pasal kita pun tak boleh pakai telephone
ya tapi saya tak boleh tidur often it's cause
uh student leader saya student leader
ya saya student leader
tapi in your secondary school
sekolah yang paling tinggi cause my school is more of a like a music school
siapa yang suka first of all
ya saya kena um bully about my looks
macam compared to primary and secondary secondary school
I prefer primary school just cause dia macam carefree at that point
right you macam tak kisah
pergi sekolah tak pergi sekolah macam it's okay
dalam sekolah apa eh
saya paling suka during saja
makanan is
simple makanan simple
like it's cause tak mahal
nak cakap murah pun tak murah sangat but
kau pergi east kan
jawapan saya is the dua dollar
dekat dah tak ada dah nak cakap innalillah pun tak boleh innalillah dah takde
dah tutup it's cause before I graduate I heard that uh they were running out of money to survive in that stall so they had to close the stall cause stall tu dengan bubble tea I ingat
saya tak fan
itu yang belakang drink stall eh
ya I remember I asked them before maggi apa dia orang pakai just cause
nak try buat kat dalam kat rumah
macam tak boleh make it tak tahu
saya rasa saya chef bob awak rasa
awak chef wan saya rasa saya tak mampu
and you know me apa-apa you kasih I I makan jer
I tak tanya apa benda saya makan jer
inshallah benda tu halal inshallah tu halal
oo soalan yang susah
wow sensitive question dia
uh waktu secondary school kan
wow I know I am I macam macam-macam lah since ah macam macam macam dari primary school it's if primary school I
it's like netball sama dia punya rules is sama macam netball
exactly the same cuma dia punya um the hoop is not the regular basketball hoop or netball hoop it's a trampoline like a vertical trampoline you have to throw it
ya very complicated tapi saya buat and then I also did
um benda ni saya tak akan lupa selama-lamanya
I nak beli air
cause it's recess time of course saya nak beli air so I pergi canteen seorang-seorang
beli air terus ada this random girl came
and then I look at her cause I macam lost kan apa seh dia ni berbual
saya tengok dia I macam huh and then she was like cause you sound like a man are you sure you never went to surgery before
okay after that selepas itu dia buat lagi and lepas tu dia buat publicly
dia depan-depan orang you know but after she did that she walked away eh no and then she said uh pretty sure you did surgery before and she walked away
saya macam tercungap tu kan so I tak tahu nak buat apa
so I just masuk dalam kelas balik then I macam just doze off cause
ya and then as the day goes by it gets worse cause like I got bullied online last time kalau you ingat like myspace blogspot was a thing
abeh macam tadi you cakap oh student
tak necessarily it's a good thing cause everybody knows you and they like to put things in each other's mouth just cause like I don't say it but they would say
I wouldn't say adulthood is like cause kalau adulthood we don't usually care about people right
if dia orang nak berbual dia orang nak berbual you know what I mean
but bila secondary school it's hard cause you have to
soalan apa susah lagi saya tak tahu macam mana nak fikir
just give myself confidence pasal kalau pasal saya insecure
and only if I had a bit of confidence to just kick out my insecurity saya rasa macam everything is gonna be okay
no saya pun tak tahu nak cakap apa
uh suka hati apa orang nak cakap saya percaya apa awak cakap
everything is susahnya soalan awak
bosan kan
agak bosan cause you're not content
so dia
saya rasa saya overthinker
you know I tukar jawapan I I actually nak cakap bali
bali balling tempat bali is everything that you
kita scared of height
conquer dalam bahasa melayu is
benda tu lah saya nak conquer saya nak conquer fear saya
saya really I'm really scared of heights
lagi rumah awak punya um yang wall tu kan yang kat luar rumah it's not like a sturdy one you know actually you know
paling worst is rumah kat toa payoh I tak tahu kalau you pernah pergi
rumah dia dekat toa payoh so like the
walkway tau it's senget so you're going down and the wall
uh the side wall it's actually very rendah like your
lepas tu I nak pekik apa tau
oo soalan paling susah lagi macam
muka macam sedih kalau tak pergi dengan awak kan takkan nak text awak babe tomorrow saya nak pergi dubai got ticket free
saya pergi um burj khalifa belikan awak
ya belikan awak
um kunci key chain right
dah tu jer lah saya mampu belikan untuk awak
makan banyak-banyak abeh sehari jer tapi dia hantar balik tak
tapi you tak tahu nak pergi mana
I tahu you
you makan jer dah memilih dah cerewet abeh you nak step
nanti dia kasih you makanan lain jer you macam
itu awak everything that you have been saying the genre it's you
mm you tahu I I tak suka movies sangat
tak tahu saya cuma saya suka falling in love the whole part of
like you get to know the person you fall in love you get a heartbreak fall in love just repeating the cycle that's me I really like it anything you tahu um nicholas sparks movies macam macam gitu favourite saya
movie dia banyak kali
tak bosan just
is cerita white chicks
itu favourite
I remember script dia semua
but tak tak macam seram ke
what's the craziest um cerita paling
yang seram I wouldn't say seram
konon macam alien ke apa ke mana tahu masih ada tapi kita tak pernah nampak
wow kita tengok banyak cerita zombie tau
so I think I don't like to think this kind of things saya tak suka saya benci fikir pasal gini
boleh anxiety tau ya cause
I think virus macam sekarang
sekarang kita COVID jer kan
although in singapore they only say like macam
I'm so sorry saya tak pernah saya tak boleh fikir lah sekarang tapi ya taiwan went to zero like really quick
actually we did though remember dulu kalau uh ada SARS
tapi SARS tak teruk macam gitu although enam tahun kan if I'm not wrong is it six years we had to go through but it wasn't like the whole world
cause I rasa
or yang bagus
ya awak ni pandai lah buat soalan macam gini
uh saya rasa
cause untuk kita macam tak ganggu kita asal kita nak kena fikir pasal benda gini
awak lucu lah um akhir hayat
awak jawab dulu saya kena fikir I'm a foodie
apa daging just daging
daging steak
taste awak mahal
awak pandai lah
sebenarnya saya nak cakap pasta tapi saya macam fikir pasal diri sendiri pula
ah saya buat pasta
sedih nah tapi sedih juga kalau hari-hari
okay awak pilih daging saya pilih ikan
both boleh steam
boleh grill boleh macam-macam
macam cara kita kan chef wan dengan chef bob
apa punya restaurant ni
kifarah lah pasal kita get
oo kifarah apa
kifarah kan dalam bahasa kita kifarah
uh saya rasa rasa
oo apa eh cause
you tak akan fikir buruk pasal tentang tentang diri you sendiri
you confirm cakap macam you baik dengan orang macam gini tapi saya rasa
sebaik kita ada buruk kan betul tak
saya buka main door
I think I buka I think a few times chey nak cakap saya baik eh tapi tak lah
I want to say good looks macam
uh awak nampak
like macam very presentable
kalau presentable dengan
I'd prefer oo susah kalau diri sendiri I prefer badan sihat
saya sekarang jer jalan tercungap-cungap
kesihatan kesihatan is everything
you nampak macam you muda tapi kalau you jalan sikit jer dah penat
asyik nak main jer
ya mak you muda eh
I know what you gonna say saya dah tahu dah apa awak cakap
dalam partner awak cari apa
oh no apa
that I'm not doing is eating I've been eating macam-macam saya makan lah saya tak
saya tak tengok portion apa saya just makan
ya siapa kisah
a'ah ada macam-macam baru makan
nanti seminit lagi saya um
to exercise tapi nawaitu saya is to exercise
saya gain weight
saya tahu awak saya kenal awak saya gain weight like crazy
badan saya kecil dengan saya nak cakap saya tak tinggi tak tinggi sangat lah but
sedang-sedang sahaja badan tapi kalau saya step on the weighing scale
I'm like fifty five apa ni saya macam
ini weighing scale yang salah ke saya yang bersalah
tapi ya
kawan-kawan dia macam oh my god huda
semua nak seh
macam gitu eh
so you nak maid lah
or is it you nak pembantu rumah
cause muka saya dah kering jadi saya macam insecure sikit
saya tak nak jadi materialistic
awak rasa macam oh dia orang ada ni
or dia orang ada ni saya tak ada
although awak ada apa yang dia orang tak ada awak tak akan
err my name azmirul I'm from singapore poly sekarang sekolah
you wanna talk about kita punya singapore poly life lah so far
sekarang boleh manage ah tapi like last time when I first entered aku really tak minat the course
so it was kind of susah lah untuk aku
oh pasal dulu my first few choices was uh business business finance abeh aku minat tourism
so I put there only my first six choice ah then my marine engineering was aku nya tujuh ke lapan ah
I not sure but yes ah aku aku tak minat tapi
aku nya points also don't give me any chance to go anywhere so aku just kena taruk the aku just kena taruk any course that I can put lah
tapi along the way alhamdulillah
aku minat ah aku minat
aku minat ah aku minat marine engineering nya module
so kau apa sekarang lah like what are you doing in school what are your activities
aku in dikir barat ah as you know
I I always tried to pull you in dikir barat masuk dikir barat tapi kau tak nak masuk so
now I really want to know the reason why kau tak nak masuk dikir barat
okay lah boleh boleh
muay thai pun
bukannya muay thai nanti
ada stage fright ke like macam ada spectators tengok
right faham faham I understand
because sekarang pun COVID
then like kita lima hari five days of school but we only come to school three days four days
then kadang-kadang
sama juga I went through the same process only that I wasn't an introvert from the start I create trouble almost all the time in secondary school
in my apa tu uh younger days ah my sec one sec two menengah satu menengah dua that kind so I
every month bapa kena call down until I was about sec three ya that was I realise yang
so that's when aku sedar lah that I have to bulk up kalau tak memang aku takleh survive N or O levels
I did get twelve points ah takleh
a decent decent decent grades for all my subject yang aku ambil
then aku end up in poly now
ya what is the most macam
what is the most naughty thing yang kau pernah buat secondary school
seems quite introvert and the most yang paling
so kira kan self self nominate kau terus masuk
actually talking about yang student student council student leader and
dulu like what you said I was very naughty nakal gila
macam apa aku buat semua aku kena tone down pasal aku chairperson of the class and my school dorang ada selalu macam best chairperson
best leader best apa so I was like
I cannot I cannot be last lah basically macam in the rankings so macam sec three tu memang quite tough lah is like I'm still naughty
but end up nanti cikgu jalan
dekat lorong angkat buku aku tolong ah I go angkat
teacher you need help ah then aku angkat aku angkat kan masuk staffroom
so kira like that was one of the worst because I didn't want student leader at all but I got it so aku just suck it up lah
and my teachers in sports leaders suka aku
pasal aku not the quiet type
but students leader punya cikgu tak suka aku pasal dia rasa aku naughty sangat so there's there's two ways that
goes around the school lah tu yang aku tak berapa suka pasal cikgu nanti ada different opinion about the same person
that's that's being naughty lah dekat sekolah
oh kira tu naughty ah kan
kira tu naughty ah kan
tu bikin kau paling guilty ah kan
guilty tak eh
jadi cikgu tertipu kan
so macam dorang dah bless ah
so lepas O level after N level
you got work as in got work part time ke
aku kerja yang kau tahu volunteer volunteer punya
yang nampak dekat uh fast jobs nanti dia cakap oh you volunteer for this run you get fifty dollar allowance ah kira that time too is big money for me know so kadang-kadang kalau ada shape run colour run or standard chartered I would just go for the volunteer
that was my basically aku nya work for my whole N level till when I go sec five ah
so aku akan kerja all the way
then basically nothing much ah aku just kerja dengan members dengan kawan-kawan with all my friends then after that after my O levels I started working properly I also work same F&B but not burger king staff
experience aku pernah tau sekali kerja
tiga hari jer off day aku nya gaji at that point of time was
going at seven fifty per hour and satu bulan aku dapat satu ribu lapan ratus
selepas minus
so if anybody interested join staff masuk lah ya so
irony but I do have some problems lah I do have some problems over there in terms of how I can click with the people because usually orang-orang yang kita kerja kat luar tu tak sama age
the same pemikiran lah basically so aku just
aku just tahan for two months then aku just took adapt aku just try to adapt to the situation lah yang aku aku was in
they are the best they are the best people to work with so friendly baik gila
ya they have to to keep to what let's say shampoos necessities semua dorang kena beli then they have to keep at home
wah salute ah dorang
I don't dah
oh is not always the sama part lah
like macam
as in aku prefer tau honestly aku would prefer a busy
a busy working environment pasal at least aku ada benda tau nak buat like something to do kalau they never come and visit they never come and buy your stuff you feel like you more tired and the time go slower
macam benda ni semua I can see cikgu kita are harsh in some ways but they are also training us to be macam very independent because in the future semua benda-benda engineering ni semua
they won't hari-hari tengok kau buat
that's why macam I feel engineering early brush you lah and if you you are not focus in the course you will really flop ah
macam betul-betul flop then susah once you know once dah jatuh in poly susah nak naik balik
aku masuk shore which is first first semester so right after this semester aku probably has a month's break then after that aku dah kena masuk intern lah
by dia punya sailing
aku nak belayar basically I just want to go
explore countries negara semua negara england semua whatever lah
uh yang ada ports semua kan saudi arabia ke whatever
so aku memang aku memang tahu yang kalau nak
dapat sailing results must be very strong
so aku legit work very hard
untuk aku year one year two tapi
aku punya type is aku tak suka lawan dengan takdir ah
so at the end of the day aku don't mind shore kalau dapat keppel okay lor
kira very good orh keppel
ya betul
but ya lah you so you are willing lah kau kira willing untuk sail every year six months
time kau balik pun dah penat
so your ultimate goal is to get macam
pasal you are not away from your family too long
surveyor macam benda relax ah
okay ah during during circuit breaker and all we all semua stuck dekat rumah
pelik but yes aku
aku found a love from
karma medic lah nama youtube channel
and aku suka biomedical from there so I did more research on it
fun fact during secondary school I took physics but all my physics class I never go you know where I go I go inside bio class duduk belakang dengar
but ya the love come back and I feel like kalau I do well in my poly get the highest that I could
I can probably try for biomedical engineering when I go uni ke apa
ya so talking about uni kita belum lagi lepas
wayang ah
so ah the frogmen one tu yang paling gerek ah
so aku nak masuk navy tapi aku tahu
aku tahu tak probably tak ada chance lah masuk navy kan
ada chance will be slim
but yes ah so kalau
tak aku nak try my best to go police
kalau police pun
aku kena train banyak so definitely I got a feeling that would be PES
kalau tak pun I don't mind
eh pula I don't mind civil defense
tu pun pergi tau sampai berapa tiga puluh minit dah sampai
my father never go so aku rasa I'll be the first to enter so I think I know always the first person will always kena hijau from the trend lah that's what they say lah but no hijau for me because secondary school I was in
and find it boring lah my opinion macam gitu-gitu jer ya okay lah tengok macam mana
tapi kalau aku dapat air force who wouldn't take it
chey wah pandai seh tak ah intelligence
what was your score though they never tell you tak bilang
but how do you think you did though was it like okay did you find it difficult ke apa
kalau let's say ke dah dah minat nak sign on
kena berapa bagus wow
ada size dia ah
sekarang berapa years
masih eh masih sama aku ingat sekarang dah tiga tahun jer primary school
bila primary school kan nanti
nanti kita tengok movie movie who's your idol who's your idol who do you like
that kind of thing you so from there kita semua dah
dah basically know the type of person you want to be like err like for me last time when I was in primary school
one of the first macam entertainment punya movie show kan was ah
macam I didn't realise tau yang itu semua watak
as in tu semua bohong macam bedek tu semua just rekaan tau I didn't know
then I thought macam okay let's say macam dulu undertaker betul-betul lah dia jahat betul-betul lah dia nak nak nak menang jer nak kasi orang sakit
so I like the character so everytime I come school I try to walk like macam undertaker
buat mata dia yang roll eyes back
so kira macam last time primary school was one of the best times because
kita explore ah
kita explore banyak benda
satu hari kita undertaker the next day we john cena the next day yuka civi
ya in primary school also dulu kita suka buat banyak parkour
striker yang
bebas like horse kick right
have you ever win the finals pernah menang
who's your bogey team ah macam selalu jumpa dorang mesti
macam you felt just dropping on your shoulders like suddenly
for me kalau bab-bab
macam atau activity kan
I was goalkeeper you know you know when kau penjaga gawang in primary school
if the goals you concede so we basically second round kita dah keluar everytime
kita masuk south zone kita keluar kita group stages
then secondary school I was in so kau tahu ada banyak
lah yang joget-joget sambil marching
ah make the police create the league untuk macam orang-orang tak
untuk all the budak melayu not only budak melayu lah budak melayu budak cina there are all types of races to come as a team to play football
so I entered that under my school name with all my classmates with all my schoolmates my juniors and seniors semua masuk
tu pun second round kita out
I join dikir barat
I join dikir barat and my first ever performance
so of course after the performance aku nangis siol
aku really my heart was pouring ah
so that that was when my mood for dikir honestly
aku kena aku kena step in to change
for dikir barat
I didn't it's not I didn't want to take it but my parents ragu-ragu ah
my parents will think eh macam mana aku nya anak nya results
sekolah pelajaran akan jeopardise ke tak
that kind of thing so aku pun macam second guess ah aku second guess but I love dikir barat so much
in dikir barat twenty eleven champion twenty twelve champion twenty thirteen fifth twenty fourteen first
the podium kind of accomplishment something that you never face before like macam nama engraved dekat dekat kau nya trophy I also never had the recognition of
pemenang dikir barat singapore poly never had that kind of recognition so but I feel like being a captain itself
it's a heavy responsibility tapi we have fun doing it right like it's fun leading and it's fun
macam teaching
your kawan takkan eh coach pasal they coach kau marah dia tapi kau as a kawan kau still tolong that kind of thing
we have our ups and downs juga ah
kau cannot
kalau kau always feel that you are at the bottom
dah kita dah improve at least be happy about it jangan cakap yay tak last
that that that pada aku tu yang paling penting ah dalam
dalam inner change
you can't keep thinking of eh kita dulu last
as in berbual macam single ke attached ke seeing someone
mana lah aku tahu aku dah lama tak jumpa
kau boleh click ah basically
cinta monyet eh dulu
happy ah dapat berbual dengan kau talk to you for an hour get to know you a bit more
and terima kasih ah

yang country yang lebih kecil
lebih senang control country yang besar macam mana nak control semua orang boleh pergi

kalau island macam singapura easier to control
semua orang dalam island

to be honest kan aku not the type to tengok ah why right aku that time sampai tak tidur seh kau tahu cerita girl from nowhere

tak apa lah dah puasa dah boleh gain balik eh tanya ah what's your favourite kuih raya
wah legit ah lain kali pergi rumah dia dia buat ah
favourite kuih raya to be honest tak tahu eh agaknya cornflake ah everybody's like confirm favourite one tapi kan sekarang these days banyak modification ah ada yang tukar nanti letak kismis lah eh tak suka seh I like the original one
hmm biasa biasa biasa ah last time I also like that ah tapi wah sedap [seh]
tu ah like personal experience right then wah every year confirm hor you open your cabinet raya finish already still confirm got a few more then obviously we go people house we ask them top up we helping them finish what make their money worth
I think ah I don't actually remember seh I think hor wah I think I just go makan man I go makan but sad lor makan only five people per table mah so everyone have to sit far far apart like now also you want go makan see everybody also sit so far apart
hmm eh then like hor during the circuit breaker during the circuit breaker hor what was your most like you cannot tahan one
to be honest ah aku ni boleh consider ah ada obsession sikit singaporean ah typical bubble tea wah when they announce ah that bubble tea closing wah jialat I already like stress eh cause like how I don't know how long they reopening what then I tried to find like other ways that I can like sub to my bubble tea wah nothing beats to it eh legit I then I just wah keep thinking of it pastu bila dia dah buka nak beli tengok queue dia tak apa ah kirim salam you leh do you drink bubble tea
eh tu sedap seh ya actually kan aku nak sub tu untuk aku punya bubble tea tau bila circuit breaker then wah jialat that one also close everything close then I don't know what to drink anymore then I think ah the circuit breaker ah was like diet to me
you buy the which one I heard the paling trend nya kan is the colour pink tu
yang pearls dia colour pink then when you go Playmade what you drink sia
eh abeh kalau compare kan semua bubble tea kan kau rasa mana satu yang paling mahal
tak eh sedap tak
oh abeh entah eh aku macam nak beli pun macam berat hati seh mahal seh uh abeh kat sekolah kau aku selalu dengar dari sekolah kau orang selalu beli bubble tea sedap ke bubble tea dia
I don't know eh to be honest ah I don't really like my school food cause first day my I I I know your school got like student price right my school standard price leh for public also then it's quite pricey then also ah not a lot of halal food then want find halal food cannot really find anywhere then maybe hmm like can only eat like McDonald's like that one easy ah halal but if you go food court that all ah quite difficult then hari hari makan nasi ayam ah then don't know eh got try my school food before
wah jialat I tell you ah wah if can ah I want buy roller blade sia it's damn far it's like my school is one end to the other end cause last time ah dengar dengar ah dorang kata my sekolah building burn down so dorang nak reclaim dorang letak at a new place ah so dorang letak new place tu dorang letak kat belakang then wah punya lah jauh like katakan eh you thought ah you thought you reach school early but wah you still reach class late but luckily my class got fifteen minutes grace so like okay lah can still use that fifteen minutes to jalan jalan your school leh your school so spaced out seh it's not besar but I think it's quite spaced out not far meh from one class to the other
but your school ah a bit weird leh cause like if see from in front ah quite small padan ah got behind behind some more quite complicated leh don't know how you can like learn how to find your way around
eh but right I know your school ah a lot of people just go there wah say only ah study always tell parents study but actually they don't really study one ah confirm like only merayap here merayap there then walk here walk there only you irritated or not
eh but sekerang tengah COVID ni tak ada orang kick you out ke you still can study at school meh
hmm but okay lah at least not like a lot of student now so so a bit better you all still got a bit more space then some more ah COVID now also you all kena separated must sit far far apart right
eh how your nenek ah like she cannot go out she at home only ah
wah not bad ah your nenek can know how to use this atas atas app
okay okay no wonder I was about to like wah so atas this one nenek modern is it then like your other family member leh they go out they work from home or go out also
hmm so like that nobody at home your nenek find more chance to keluar lah
then do you prefer her lama one or sekarang one
hmm then favourite makanan like masakan dia what for you
hmm then kau often tak tolong dia kat dalam dapur
but tak salah your area semua dekat dekat jer kan
oh abeh usually you all walk or like what
hmm but okay lah at least you with your nenek is it then you got friend then you can talk talk like that
hmm then wah did you miss your nenek cooking when you go school or what
dan hari ni kita akan berbual tentang anything under the sun
school sekolah
super senang apa lagi
like is it fun ada kawan-kawan ke tak
abeh kau punya time table like how is your
is it banyak time untuk relax atau tak
abeh pukul berapa what like what time is your lesson
oh ya I saw like I always see your Instagram like kau macam penat gila because you always like
abeh aku wave at you and you literally didn't you ignored me bro I was so sad
no aku literally waved at you
embarrassed kan ya aku pun I felt so malu because of that
that time aku remember that I told you the story
like that time I was down your block I saw this girl pakai tudung exactly same as you
err I aku aku not mad at you aku mad at the situation because aku was so embarrassed aku malu gila I was down the block
I saw uh cause it was at night malam-malam so aku saw this lady
she was wearing her tudung and she was in the dark
wave paling besar di dalam dunia like literally like this
macam tak kena gitu situation gitu
ya so for me sekolah aku I think it's super senang to go to school because I don't have to take a bus
aku tengah flex right now ya
ya cause now my school kalau kau nak masuk kau nak kena ada dia punya card like the specific card
measures no uh no as in in terms of the zones like for your school kau ada zone like different different zones
yang colour biru merah orange
the only my school has mala at uh food court empat
ya tu pun
oh kita punya junior eh
oh dia makan mala
ya ya tapi kita boleh masuk ke tak
but the thing is mala at causeway point macam mahal gila
I don't know if it's mahal gila eh
no tapi um I told amira then I um err apa jaz
jaz she ate it it was like seven dollar per person cause dia tak makan the daging semua the daging is a mistake
who eats the daging you just go for the
that doesn't count as daging that counts as one of those processed meat macam spam daging is like literally daging yang macam masak tu
of course it's gonna be mahal it's like duck meat err
remember duck meat punya ramen that we ate at the apa
I was asking my bapa cause he was like asking like suggestions to eat and I was like oh can I suggest then I was like oh can we eat at the ramen and then he was like err I'll think about it then we never eat
was it one of those like lemak
oh ya sebab kau punya stomach kan ada problem sekarang
kesian baby
uh sebab you're like a baby you can't like handle the full Samyang experience that sounds like a
macam like the gravy ah
I don't I don't get why you don't like the carbonara one carbonara one is literally like the best punya flavour
man aku baru makan Samyang on is it yesterday or two days ago
is it because you never leave it inside for a longer time because I like my Samyang to be like puffy what's the word macam like
oh I don't know why but semalam aku macam on a
university punya rush so I was like looking at all the
ya because I aku fikir uh I really don't have a choice but to like look through siapa lia punya boyfriend sekarang dekat kan
what was his his course ah or should I ask like lia to ask him about dia punya experience
ada banyak mm
dorang take in like
ya kau tak kau tak research ke
then lepas poly kau nak buat apa
you actually like oh so kau macam like committed ah in that sense okay
uh aku scared yang dorang tengah trying to convince you to spend more money by the way they say it
she ya you should just since kau ada connection might as well just take advantage of it ah
dekat singapore
kerja kat perth ah
jangan world ni dah dah start ni dah start dah start
tadi tadi macam like on a you're still on the ground tapi ni a bit like floating
you I thought your mum ada your mum kasi
or I thought she was the one yang ada attachment punya issues dengan kau
macam like my kawan elisa
dia pun like thinking of
yang half malay half chinese yang whose in my classmate
oh tu tahu okay um elisa dia selalu kata but to her ma yang oh
ma one day I might want to go to like overseas or like migrate and then she's then cause she's like the youngest one and then all her kakak is like big
so dia mak dia selalu like oh then I'll come with you lah macam gitu
cause mak dia is quite to tua lah ya
and she said it okay okay she did lah it wasn't kinda like show off show offy punya manner
so aku then I was like aku macam shocked because I didn't know this also like it makes sense lah because she's also like super smart
my course is so filled with so many smart people aku macam so intimidated
it's uh sometimes no no we're not competitive that's not like the that's just not our culture lah our punya course punya culture like no one is like
we're like so sikit
punya orang if we like make enemies then the ecosystem will like break you get what I mean
kau punya course banyak orang y'all make enemies you won't you can just like
tak tahu err but I think she's still going for the
apa macam plan like have like one whole like plan for like dorang punya rest of their lives
after poly dorang gi university then after that apa kerja sikit then
so like whenever I'm with her aku macam like intimidated sikit ah sebab aku selalu kan aku ada going with the flow punya attitude
but I know what I want to like but at least like luckily I got like what I want to do lah I think it's my intern lah you were right what you were saying apa
kau punya comment lah like huda I'm so proud of you
pergi overseas
tapi dia like pandai enough to go for local uni ah so I'm not too worried about her
uh I think her overseas dream is untuk like
like kerja sana
ya sebab dorang ada minimum wage semua
I mean kau ada
it's better to like have a loan with your parents than a loan with like a bank because banks are always like the interest semua the
ya I think the realisation that kita macam like growing up just like hits
oh sebab ada dina
ah foundation or whatever tak tahu
I want to learn more about like apa
aku nak belajar more about macam like social work gitu
when I went for my intern I really like felt macam like left uh not left out lah I just felt
not in the social work ah kan aku bilang kau social service organisations semua
tu like in the
kalau all fails I I can be like a teacher kau pun nak jadi teacher
cikgu kan
cikgu aliah
I mean like aku aku knew that I had like interest in like
kerja for like the community gitu like I like to give back to the society gitu because like
doing business just like sucks the life out of you like it's so like macam boring and like
I really like at the end of the day aku macam like
macam apa haziq
haziq dia pergi apa kau tahu yang internship yang international
but then sebab
the overseas punya internship it was supposed to be overseas
ah tak tahu pula
ya tapi sebab dia kan like
dia he okay okay so
I know kau kind of like sceptical pasal dia punya like wealth
tapi uh elisa like dia explain to aku like dia punya how
in this like manner maybe kau macam like believe
so dia millionaire sebab
he would like his family would like invest in like oil punya stocks
apa return investment I'm like aku macam like a terrible
hundred thousand which should like deduct to be like sekarang kau believe tak
ni ni on like um oil
dorang kaya dorang like old money
cause sebab uh apa
on last friday tu aku I had to do like a sharing
sharer there who's like an punya student tapi haziq was there also and I'm like ugh
ah nanti aku show kau I was like talking about pe
you know aku pulled out all the I pulled out all the cards macam
and then he also talking about his internship ah tapi really kesian dia lah dia macam kau
apa cause about COVID then he had to like
come back to singapore gitu
kau cancelled immediately sebab was like in a mess
tapi this one was like indonesia was still like okay lah singapore indonesia boleh pergi because it was like in the same like circumference
so they ah pergi lah but then
after that they were like err this is worst than we expected you have to come back then gitu
because your one is apa macam tourist punya management so you you had to like have people there
this one was like business so everything could have been done online lah so it semua makes sense ah I'm
be tapi aku didn't like expect there's like oh
kau nak cakap pasal addison rae
I think that's like her brand lah that's macam apa jojo siwa
oh ya allah
then kau jangan kau jangan tengok video dia lah it's like she's not forcing you to watch her video
like I saw dia buat yang makeup punya video yang dia buat like clown
tak tahu lah
tak tahu lah I just see jer
wait aku Google avani net worth sekarang
oh dia tu takde like takde dia punya it
whoa kau kau memang critical of her eh
she's ni budak kecil
ya allah you're too critical of this show eh
dah kau punya addison rae punya sharing dah habis
would I love to talk to her but if I know like aku someone sikit
like dia he can talk lah
so but james sekarang kan dia ada banyak like years of experience sebab dia kan he was like he was the cover girl
he was the first like male punya cover girl so he went for a lot of apa talk shows dengan ellen semua
you know so kau you need to like be like
baik like kinder to them sikit lah please
tapi dorang famous
kau nampak yang TikTok punya
coffee punya tu manis oi and I was like seeing like four pumps of like mocha you know you saw that one
I aku aku bilang kau kan yang coffee kadang kasi aku macam anxiety so aku macam aku sangat
it's like I think uh cause I think aku ada break from coffee sebab I was like
kat rumah the whole time so I didn't like really was like
then after that uh I think a couple of weeks ago when I texted you was the first macam like
time minum coffee then aku my anxiety was like I had like I was so anxious
and then suddenly aku macam like so like scared
that day aku minum coffee day lah because I thought it was just like a one off thing you know
macam you know experiment we have to do it like a couple of times to make sure you're right
sekarang aku really cannot minum coffee again
which is sedih cause I love the taste of coffee you know how much I love like the taste of coffee
was it because of anxiety or apa
kau bodoh eh that's like the worst
kau macam better lah so
tapi tak pernah pass out
the day you actually pass out then you're like oh huda aku pass out I'll be like
kau nak pass out kan pass out lah
I guess now sebab aku tak boleh minum coffee then it should be easier for both of us ah so whenever Starbucks ada one for one I will never ask you
best punya
because uh aku try the LiHO punya pun
um it just doesn't hit as much as Sharetea punya oo
the matcha doughnut yang aku beli that day
it was so sedap sebab aku popped it in the microwave for like ten seconds it
but I bought also the mochi punya dough the like circle circle tu
uh mochi okay aku Google eh sebab uh kau tahu newt dari TikTok
oo sedap oi
and I was like aku expected it to be sedap ah
yang Dunkin' Donuts tu
aku I was feeling it cause these days I really love like sweets yesterday aku beli apa crepe
punya cake kau pernah rasa crepe cake
uh kat it was one of those like
halal punya baker
bukan Chateraise um one of those like malay punya J&C ke entah apa
bukan J&C it was one of the
uh so ya I I really like love sweets these days sebab mm aku kan manis
oh ya aku saw that's why kau tak reply kita punya message

ya ya the ice cream semua they had that

she I think she sebab kan dia memang ada feelings for rafi so I understand where she's coming from lah
I know it's obvious yang kau tak suka dia from the day one kau tak suka dia
to apa
the first so like the first time can you nampak dina
I think sebab it just
kesian sia
okay kau cakap dengar dengar aku tengah dengar ni
breaded tak
impulse like impulse tu
salvage dia punya
dia reply aku
dia tengah salvage
aku relieved ah yang dia tak ada grudge to aku cause I really like
err I feel aku rasa macam like
um maybe sekarang sebab ada pandemic there's a bit too much businesses but
orang yang suka baking then they sell like those
I'm aku kan bilang kau aku aku dah orang manis so I need to consume err manis
but I like apa my favourite treats are like
I like dia punya frosting punya flavour that's all I like I don't like macam like simple like chocolate rice gitu
aku uh aku uh aku a complicated girl
so rishi was like talking about it semalam
I would feel sedih also
of course korang best korang best friend
ya dia date untuk
like she wants them to act way more mature for their age dia ada dia punya expectations
terlalu high
and she's she expect all these guys to have like a stable job when apa dorang kat poly ke serving
you know kita tengah sekolah
is it sebab dia desperate to like
can like also get out of the house or something sebab dia punya environment very like toxic sikit
kau tengah give off love
ya tapi he can't he can't help it pe
and safirah couldn't help but falling for him at least sekarang dia over him lah but now she has this guy
hais kesian dia
belum lah that's why I put it inside the laundry punya basket
uh I would put it inside the washing machine then I would tu ya wash
uh bila aku ada bibik uh when I was bila aku kecil
and that's because sebab dulu like basuh basuh basuh basuh so it's like
but sekarang we do it on our own lah
and then I had the bibik to take care of my moyang
actually sekarang so far
I mean being in army like a lot of things already sudah restricted so
naturally we all sudah tak boleh keluar tak boleh go see our friends and all that so weekdays all aku pun tak free then
you know follow so that you know sekarang tak tak dapat saman kan ya
oh ya now is like the limit is wait is it still five or sekarang sudah buat sepuluh orang is it
actually if I'm not wrong now kalau wedding kan then we can have up to fifty people right
oh so sekarang means ikut shift ah dia punya macam wedding or like
oh cause from what I know is like next week I have a jemputan
cause from what they told me is that now only I think about lima puluh
the table sudah nak kena be err separated
kat your instagram story right pasal err the new system
you get certain score and all that then doesn't make you eligible to masuk like
if you understand then you can explain a bit lah macam
err cause both of us are going off field and all that then kat dalam hutan
sudah lah tak ada signal tak ada handphone pula
tak akan nak check news kan I mean news is legitly the last thing on my mind
just give me the opportunity to jumpa new people to interact more with err
tak wasted lah ya I really get to use it to
kalau if you ask me personally whether I would
give back more to the masyarakat
right I mean aku masih muda lagi
then what are the things like uh kau guys kau buat
what's the activities yang kau suka buat like say on a weekend lah ya
maybe go to the beach pergi jogging ke
okay pergi makan
cause I I I think I agree with you with that cause the moment you masuk camp
I think that's the one oh when my mum masak you know
like what my family suka buat kalau on weekends right is that
we usually try to make sure cause weekends is err bila everyone is
my adik and my mum they're free
err walking or cycling lah just around the area cause I stay err dekat dengan apa tu east coast
so kalau nak pergi beach pun err tak jauh sangat
kalau hujan lebat then okay lah that's when
make it like seimbang you know err just have a balance
kalau weekends you think about it you only have dua puluh empat jam
timing yang kita ada is definitely limited
kalau anything about pun I'm not so afraid to just bilang dia orang ah
eh last time dulu aku papa pun buat ini buat ini like last
ah dulu kalau nak pergi keluar nak kena march and don't know what
wait I I was also enlisted in tekong so jadi
my family also ikut pergi sampai tekong and then they all
mum and dad adik and my eh my adik
and my nenek my err makcik
then we went to the cook house then check the food then of course lah kalau first day kan
they all need to set a good impression for all the parents so dia orang give the best food lah that they have
then ah I remember that day wah boleh nangis seh
ah rindu lah haven't been so
all nyanyi-nyanyi right all bising-bising
no ours was ours dua belas I think
macam total check my financial spending ah and really pen down pen and paper what
think about it err the duit that I
err set aside for macam macam transport kan
then after that kalau transport there and back cause I don't know selalu aku take grab lah
err careful with the where you spend the duit lah
start menjimatkan wang lah uh especially now that
beli mcdonald's beli what all that it's just like
no no no tomorrow lah at the start then can go out beli baju kan
now err sebab all got the macam mana nak cakap the elections kan
cause err kalau you look at it right now
some of them like kasihan juga lah you look at them then they're like if they end up
err just buang all their duit during cause they ya our seniors ah
all buang their duit during then because of that when they they don't have as much then
and really err how to say err jaga your own money
I think for me like what you asked just now right uh tadi you said
cause definitely I really don't want to bebankan my parents financially lah and most of the
kalau extend contract kan jadi sampai cause
the idea is that err kalau we stay longer kat dalam camp
tapi mm tak tak sedap sangat
I mean tak it's not that bad
like uh tak jadi beban to your parents ah
tapi now
okay tapi now I feel like ya let's just talk about makanan ah really that's like my favourite thing to talk about
no I mean it's like sometimes it's like eh you want to go eat it's a it's a it's a it's not I'm not necessarily lapar or anything
tapi it's just a excuse for me to like
err jumpa kawan jumpa family
err eratkan silaturahim lah with people people that
like you say asalkan halal I'm steady lah
a'ah eh kampung food aiya nevermind lah bro
apa kalau kau beli rendang right it's like what one piece it's already like I I also don't know ah I think it's like three dollars at least
then worst is sotong
so you you buy sotong that time
bulan puasa then my family pergi geylang kan nak makan
nak okay not makan sorry nak beli untuk buka lauk ah
standard ah you'll pack away take away lauk right
call that err sotong right the
sotong hitam sotong hitam that was the big squid then it was like what
in my opinion ya sebab kalau lapar kan a quick fix
ya then sebab it's convenient
err stand in one row right then semua beli maggi then tambah telur
then the telur selalu macam tak masak apa the aunty will say eh setengah masak but it's like
obviously not cooked then we just kacau everything then makan terus
encik tan encik tan bro that's like the go to nasi
then after that it naik sampai berapa eh
sampai tujuh puluh lapan bro
there is no way right kau boleh belajar and study at the same time
ya is ya oh sorry makan dan belajar at the same time sorry
so jadi we had to make do with what we had then
usually kita beli what err just nasi campur
or the india punya makanan ah
what we had was what err nasi padang right
nasi padang and the asagani stall
oh do you remember when err dulu
when we used to beli the nasi goreng first right then we just ask eh ada nasi kway
cik ada nasi goreng ada kway teow goreng then she'll be like
eh ada ada okay okay err jangan bilang orang then we
suddenly it's like everyone knew what nasi goreng was
honestly it was I think it was a different type of nasi goreng I I don't haven't tried it outside yet
there's no nasi goreng that I've tried that does like that it's super spicy
hey it was a super spicy nasi goreng
bulan puasa bro
okay bukannya susah sangat
betul betul okay understand
I try to masak lah sometimes cause when I'm at home
especially when I got oh actually I won't say it's masak but I try to bake when I have the time to
ya some things I did was eh that time remember bulan puasa
I made err err suji for everyone
because tak boleh agak how much err ramuan you need right
and all the sukatan-sukatan all that was very obscure to me
and some are online recipe ya first time buat then they say eh
ya ya that's true that's that's very tiny tiny suji right
then sudah sudah sudah habis buat then dia punya what you call that
when I made the err the whole aduan right it was a bit
so when I tried to make kuih for the first time that's what happened ah then the suji came out
I stay in the east area then this amshar pula tinggal kat
apa woodlands kan jauh gila so obviously
nak naik train pun I took like one and the half hours so
wah memang but that day sempat lah
sempat sempat balik bedok by buka seh
cause I left quite late I remember oh then I stopped by ang mo kio I wanted to meet tok mat to pass him the suji then he gave me another whole
um what you call that a whole container of kuih tart in return so
what was it ah it was oh hari raya oh I was I had leave
ya is no bro is the eve of raya bro
eh tak boleh ah I got interview then I was like oh okay lah then I go to your house ah
nasib baik I remember where you stay sia
actually this kind of thing also honestly I a bit kekok but but why did the the baking thing was that
suji for myself it's just dah
tak masuk akal lah for me to eat everything oh what
ya for everything on my own obviously I eat one or two sudah a bit muak sikit kan
let's say kalau I'm outside kan then I see people macam
need help especially older people naik naik bus that kind of thing then angkat the bag all like go inside right
paiseh kan because if you think about it eh ah memandai jer nak tolong
then err obviously she understands that aku pun nak she understands that aku pun nak tolong dia kan
kalau the makanan kan is halal right it will be less
but then err aku pun tak nak susahkan dia orang right
ya ambil hati also then they also tak nak
eh actually I feel bad macam I I don't I
ah kari asam pedas bro that that nestle ice cream container got asam pedas
but tapi kalau you
ya but then err the my other halal option is uh mamak lah
mamak stall lah bro supper club
ah infomercials that's why there's kalau kau tengok jamaah kan one suria and all that
so obvious eh like eh ah abang
err susu biasa lah tak payah pakai
ha ha I think I see this most often about my nenek lah
ya they they I mean in general my nenek cooks everyday
for for starters my nenek is quite open to all this also
kan ada tetamu datang obviously you have to prepare something right for them
but because we sudah bawa makan
ya tak payah susah sangat
you know we used to beli ah sweet talk semua kat bawah block kan
ya only if you use like special discount ke
okay kalau sudah ada kahwin okay sudah kahwin pun boleh lah
ya masak tak akan hari-hari nak masak maggi
I saw your posting bro not bad ah kau dengan kau punya baju suit semua very classy eh not bad eh
berapa lama kau kerja sana ah
ye ke tapi aku dengar dorang cakap saudi arabia is a very corrupted country tau
cause ya I saw a lot of news right especially the the prince kan the prince sulaiman he a lot of controversies about him and then you know now his his other neighbouring countries the arab countries ah have a lot of war and then his ties with the america nya
arab countries but anyway I mean I think this is too much of a politic abeh kau bila kau kat saudi arabia selain solat kau buat apa sana
oh so if you were given another chance kau will travel saudi arabia or would you like to try negeri lain
so speaking of football kan abeh orang-orang main bola ni semua dorang masih main ke dorang pun dah stop macam kita orang juga
ah negara luar macam messi ronaldo ni semua kan dorang masih main ke or they have to you know take a pause from this cause of the COVID pandemic
tapi sementara jer bro cause ah
kalau kau tengok betul-betul eh sekarang kau tengok electric punya tariff dah naik nine point three per cent abeh so I think the government will first
for for them lah but I mean we have no choice we have to make do of what we can abeh sekarang ni kau kerja apa ninja van eh
oh savings eh tapi slowly your savings will also
jadi kurang kan abeh kau tak worry ah
tak bro that one was just uh interview that I went to went for
um not bad lah you know I think there's more opportunities in the healthcare industry so why not aku just try to continue so for now aku just uh aku kerja as a clinic assistant ah
which is quite tough ah banyak patients and
you know banyak demands
the protected gear ah eh and then uh quite safe ah kau kau kalau ikut all the safety protocols ah everything should be fine and should be
guess there's no I would I would say little risks involved ah I mean I'm a clinic assistant myself so I've been working there for six months or so and I've been healthy ever since aku tak pernah ambil semua seh so aku maybe ah my immune system is strong but I would say that if you follow the protocols everything should be fine
mm kalau kau tengok betul-betul kat luar pun there's a lot of a
uh and it's been a growing trend ah I see a lot of uh races actually uh branching into this line cause selama ni aku tengok pun orang yang kerja grab food pun ye lah orang-orang kita kan betul tak
tapi sekarang dah macam banyak orang nak cause of the situation then they have no choice and they know that
kalau aku aku ada bini anak semua aku kena jaga aku kena kerja at least gaji aku eh aku at least rasa kena at least two point five and above ah itu pun depends kalau aku ada banyak anak ke tak kalau tak aku rasa kerja-kerja normal is quite risky ah kalau kau kerja macam
err gaji yang one K plus jer unless if you only living with your wife
mm that's the mindset of the youngsters nowadays ah you know our generations especially tapi if you were to think about it
know the traditions tu yang susah tu the culture of our our race kan kita nak ada banyak anak nak kena
you know cause they can't even sustain themselves abeh macam mana seh nak sustain kalau ada anak semua kan nak kena bayar bill
bayar susu diapers semua I mean of course definitely they they you know dapat baby bonus ni semua tapi berapa lama seh boleh tahan
tak boleh tahan kan aku rasa
ya but singapore pun
I mean kau kena faham-faham ah singapore dorang akan kasi kau grants for free nya apa
err like sekarang kau tengok dorang dah increase traffic eh electricity nya price nanti air pun nanti mungkin naik so but I mean the government they are doing their best lah I think cause they really want singapore to success to succeed as a country kan to remain at the top
abeh no choice ah
government I think government will try their best lah but we we still have to find ways ah no matter what aku rasa
kita kena hustle ah this is a hustling years lah just like macam dulu ah time SARS zaman SARS dulu pun dorang
economy pun jatuh tapi kau tengok slowly
singapore will rise up again and it's really up to ourselves ah we cannot really depend on the government we have to hustle and hustle till we make it ah orang cakap
so speaking of which you see the bills for our housing dah berapa jer
tapi personally aku tak tahu ah aku rasa
easily if you're stressed you know you have to take care of your body ah mentally physically aku tengok ramai sekarang kerja kerja kerja tapi tak exercise tak you know take their time to you know relax to ease off kalau tak
kau pun boleh terjejas ah kesihatan kau nanti kau pun teruk ah
macam lagi ramai orang I mean dorang dorang memang susah pe so I think macam aku nak cakap dorang dah get used to it lah abeh tapi I think this is more troubling for people who are in the
uh wealthily macam orang yang senang abeh tiba-tiba jadi susah macam gini kan then dorang macam terus jadi stress sebab tak biasa dengan keadaan macam gini kan
dalam susah aku rasa sebab dorang dah biasa susah so dorang might know what to do or might hustle even like normally ah they do like hustle really hard tapi orang yang dah dah biasa senang dah biasa ada kerja
high position semua gaji besar tiba-tiba kena buang abeh tak boleh survive kan gini so that's why dorang stress kan
and then we have to fight through ah and speaking of which kan berbual pasal COVID aku recently baca news trump kena COVID is it true
aku tengok ah siol tapi the thing is kenapa china buat macam gini eh I mean what's the rationale
behind their their actions macam I I don't think there's any benefit or anything to prove
apa ni world
organisations eh yang the one with apa united nations is it
dorang pun are against it tau abeh aku tak faham kenapa they are still doing this eh but I think cause they are in the position of power so they don't give a they don't care ah aku just buat ni tak ada orang boleh stop aku
so even though aku might say that I'm not
with trump but since trump is against china kan aku might side with trump ah just for the sake of you know of what he did of what china did to our muslims kan
then aku rasa it's it's it's really cruel ah but I don't know why kau rasa kenapa dorang buat macam gini eh
which are aku rasa it's just too much ah to be honest this is just like macam zaman-zaman dulu seh if kalau kau belajar history kat secondary school semua kan kalau kau belajar kau tengok ah hitler kau tengok macam orang macam um stalin of what they have done
so it's aku rasa it's just it's just effed up ah aku rasa zaman sekarang dah rabak ah aku rasa nak dekat akhir zaman serious
sebab setahu aku eh
the black err civil rights activist ni semua they have been fighting for the black lives for so long and yet
I don't understand the the the reason why they are so against the black people macam
aku rasa tak tahu eh macam
that's what I heard also ah macam apa ni dia ada counterfeit nya duit kan
but I think this is really just how the the mindset of the police or how the system of the police dekat america is being
ah so kalau aku rasa kalau kau as an american kan kau tinggal kat sana baru kau tahu ah macam mana
aku tak aku tak imagine kalau this situation were to happen in singapore
kita sikit jer dah riot dah satu satu dunia satu ni dah kecoh satu country
apa lagi kalau legit kalau kita nampak kita kita kalau witness kita nya own singapore police buat gini confirm kecoh habis perang habis kasi habis ni cakap
ah aku rasa
I think it memang exist ah aku rasa the government is doing their best that's why they have all these laws have all these
take care of the other racial feelings but you you cannot escape from all these soft racism ah it it will happen in all countries in all places and aku rasa that's why the government
tapi nak buat macam mana kalau government tak tekun dengan dia punya laws semua kan tak tak really ah
be serious about this then aku rasa kita nya country
will be like other countries ah I mean let's just look at our neighbour ah malaysia kau tahu malaysia sendiri kalau
okay aku sendiri melayu kan aku tak nak cakap
tapi aku rasa the malay rights over there it's
it's belittling the other races ah tak tahu ah aku rasa dari malaysia
so kalau aku bangsa lain aku cina kata kan aku cina eh abeh aku nak beli rumah aku malaysia citizen tapi aku cina setakat bangsa aku cina tapi aku kena bayar extra mahal sebab aku cina
eh a'ah betul juga eh
macam dorang tak bersyukur eh macam apa dorang dapat
that's what aku personally see lah or feel bila aku when aku tengok kat news
err videos on the internet what what kau rasa macam mana sana kau pernah gi sana tak
and it's sad to see ah tapi aku tak faham ah kenapa najib dia dia dah kena tangkap kan aku dengar dia dapat confirm he's dia dah found guilty kan
it's just so chaotic macam tak ada orang control seh macam those pekik-pekik suka hati abeh marah-marah parliament lain
of all this it's it's very interesting to see how other countries govern the people or or choose their people to represent what aku tak faham ah macam aku tengok aku nak ketawa seh macam
boleh dorang ada orang macam gini to represent eh
mm aku pun nampak ni dekat facebook or youtube ah
but ah I think it's on twitter tapi how did he get away with this how can you ask someone to
but aku aku really wonder how
ah recruitment and the position that is of power ah macam ni semua position important important seh abeh kau suka-suka hati kalau boleh just get away with all these things
if you were given a choice eh kau will live in malaysia or would you want to live in singapore
the money money wise I think what I would do aku would probably kerja kat singapore
tapi um
tapi aku would live there so aku can know have a lot of make a lot of more money ah abeh aku boleh spend
ah tu eh that's true eh aku rasa I mean
tapi if if I want to be in singapore also having to wake up later and then it still it still I think in singapore it still all about work if you are in the not in the higher position ah which you have to climb eventually
aku rasa it's all about
or to live happily in singapore whatsoever tapi
ah currently I don't have any girlfriend cause we are living in hard times and I I don't think I can uh I think it's more important for me to focus on myself ah sia I need I need to get more money first for myself imagine if I have a girlfriend abeh aku tak boleh sustain mata air aku
then teruk ah puas hati aku ada banyak duit then aku boleh ada girlfriend then aku boleh you know
kita dua-dua boleh enjoy
tapi ya lah
then what kau kau ada mata air
know we we may not kita tak tengok orang-orang lain macam mana juga
people who are happily in the relationship together they dorang macam relax jer tak post apa-apa just happily stay together and all that so I think is I think we should not be influenced easily ah
to tengok orang macam gini semua kan I think ada segelintir ah mungkin dorang macam rasa the same thing tapi
ada juga ah golongan yang you know uh having good relationships ah so aku rasa kau should give a try tapi ye lah likewise you know aku rasa sekarang tengah susah kan so now it's not it's not the right time to to find a girlfriend but rather to upgrade yourself ah
whoever is lacking in in terms of financial or whatever tapi
for my race but entah aku rasa macam
tak boleh ah kita tak boleh sebagai lelaki kita kena tetap
you know tunjuk yang kita boleh lead anak orang betul tak
tapi no choice ah this is how
we uh most parents are dealing with their child cause kita pun nak kena survive pe nak cari duit it's all about money ah singapore is all about being financially stable ah and that sacrifice have to be made ah kalau kau nak
so aku rasa that's why some cultures they
abeh uh
abeh macam uh
dah terpaksa ah aku rasa it's dah macam
dah ni dah kehidupan orang-orang kita ah sekarang zaman-zaman sekarang lagi-lagi sekarang tengah hidup susah so
that's why aku rasa financial planning is very important kita kena plan sekarang before having a kid you know not just funfair buat lepas tu at last kita susah then all these problems come later for us to think so right now we have to think first before having a kid what should we are we
are we stable cukup tak makanan cukup tak duit untuk keluarga bayar ni bayar tu
and to have a beautiful family ah tu aku rasa ah um yup
on your end kau rasa apa
kau ambil train ke kau ambil
bro jangan kuat sangat
ya tak aku ingat kau jalan dengan kat sini
aku mimpi aku pregnant babe then the mimpi was so real is like macam kau tahu bila kau tengah give birth
ya I can feel the pain it's sakit gila babe
ya habis baby tu keluar babe I I don't know who is the father also but ya itu jer lah mimpi aku
err nobody ah it's just me and the baby and some other people that aku tak kenal
dia macam baby biasa I guess like anak perempuan habis cute tapi nakal ah habis dia minta susu dengan aku selalu
no leh it's more of like I have to jaga this baby
ya aku memang mimpi pasal baby banyak ah aku tak tahu apa pasal but in real life aku memang macam tak nak anak ah
mm ya lor but then aku suka budak-budak apa and I like to spend time with them but I don't know right ya yes
cause aku dulu suka buat macam that kind of like diary entry like from that year or whatever
very like ya reflective and macam gini
all right lah yang benda-benda bodoh ah macam
aku rasa aku masih dengan azee seh
so aku aku just dengan kawan aku aku remember ya about her and then like
ya lor but then um ya aku rasa
like are you still friends with that girl the kawan aku kan uh but like
but dulu sec four kau ada macam mimpi-mimpi eh impian-impian ke
see lah my english all berterabur already
mm I think very small things like kalau
orang tu macam tak text aku balik or what I think aku fikir yang bukan-bukan but then I aku macam don't act on it lah but sometimes I'll I'll be
even though you think maybe it's something personal but kau try to
a'ah satu hari tu kat bus aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku tweet pasal perempuan ni kat bus habis dia macam
tak nak jalan babe dia macam tak nak give aku way habis
in the end like dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak seats kat belakang then bila banyak seats kat belakang aku geram lah macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan eh
and then me being passive aggressive aku macam
okay lah tak apa ah aku just diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia
then terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan babe
at last dia duduk so pun tak apa
aku tak tahu maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then dia macam nak buat macam you know muka yang macam
mm step tak nampak aku gitu
aku stare dia seh aku dah macam minah red aku dah keluar habis
habis what about you
aku rasa macam you're the least petty person ever
or like me zaman dulu lah because
ya ya bila aku dengan zee I mean like this girl nama apa eh nama dia apa eh aku lupa tapi dia kawan zee
then this girl dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally what right
exactly it's because dia cakap ah apa ni aku date zee that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
nasib baik buat apa call aku eh
dah lah it's okay lah don't have the red one lah
but then ex kau yang lagi satu
okay but if if I were to choose I think aku nak macam to be able to speak

allowance berapa lama ni
sixteen seconds bodoh bagus
siapa seh aku nak jadi I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal
apasal seh
aku tahu tapi I didn't like
so it's like okay lah kan nothing wrong with that but I think because we older already so we don't really macam judge too harshly
like you wake up as them but you're still yourself rabak though then suddenly I can speak malay
that will make the news you know wah stray kids can speak malay one tiba-tiba
like tak payah pergi kerja ah

ya I know lah some of them macam they everytime will find an opportunity to just say eh kat belakang kau ada benda or whatever but I can tell lah that is fake lah
I think I tak tahu lah maybe dia orang gila ah nak attention but then why would you want attention that way
like I remember that time I met my boyfriend there and then he was like eh kau tahu tak boyfriend kau ada macam lembaga hitam dekat belakang dia then I was like

not working um working lah working from home ah err kira work from home
um ya lah basically macam bake cake ah kebanyakan bake cakes
then err lagi macam jual baju ada jual baju juga um
jual baju is on facebook live you've seen that facebook live before right ya so
I do like baking habis baking is like when people want to order from me they can just
contact me ah dekat instagram or carousell they can find me there and then
wait for them I will make lah pasal sometimes because I'm also like working part time as well like juggling three jobs at the same time oh my god
as of now sekarang ah I prefer baju jual baju
sebab um
baking and then macam very penat it's very tiring ah very tiring then I need err actual like
okay lah so I need actual kitchen dia macam tempat pun tak ada then
I love baking I still love baking but inshallah like in the future kalau if I have err a kitchen space then I maybe will continue back my baking is not I stop baking lah I'm still baking lah it just that now only once a month twice a months
will will apa maju english
um for now kan I sell facebook live sahaja kan so in the future I will do mostly like um okay how to I like attract more customer is it
live won't die off but if it does die off kalau dia die off kan um I already dah macam ada my customer base I already have I dah ada so even if the facebook live die off they can come over to my shop they already know my name my name is well known ready
I know which right now currently sekarang tiktok is doing it
tiktok has a live um ya tapi for one thousand followers and above
not in the future during the future I think it will apa banyak orang akan jual barang dekat tiktok
but ya the part ah the part where you said um body body builders pakai instagram is tadi cakap
actually it's true you know because I I don't know why I think it was back I was like really into those yang bikin body bikin body
ya kalau beli phone baru pun is better I feel like beli phone can buy camera apa camera yang good quality
that's why I also like planning to buy new phone juga with a good quality camera on the phone which I do not know tapi I kena find out lah
oh oh it got contract or just the phone itself oh oh I dengan contract I ada contract
no what I want to err what err err a a phone with camera sebab kan I cakap I ada facebook live kan
so I can take pictures of my clothes take good quality I mean sekarang I can use my phone to take good quality ah but it's not good quality it is just a picture which is nice but it's not a good quality picture
okay but my one I have no problem sekarang sebab I have microphone I have microphone
what sekarang my camera quality for me macam tak apa uh not bad okay cuma kena ada good wi-fi
connection if wi-fi connection is not good dia akan
so that's why sometime you see my video will be like macam err a bit not good quality sebab wi-fi connection wi-fi connection is important
like that is apa kena pakai wi-fi connection more daripada mobile data kalau mobile data bila pakai dia lagi rabak dia punya lagging
benda-benda yang I tak tahu I pun tengok youtube juga ya so macam ya because so come back to youtube juga of course tapi macam mana eh you nak jual baju dekat youtube
tapi I nak phone baru mainly sebab I nak ambil gambar of this baju yang I ada okay I'm not concerned about
the live punya video
apa live video quality I'm not concerned about that that much sebab so far all the phone kalau yang rabak pun dia punya quality is very good I'm concerned about pictures that coming out and gonna post it on my facebook
no lighting is a need as well tapi I really have lighting okay I already have lighting I just need to learn more
eye to see which one is nice which one is not ah you sendiri have to tengok sendiri lah mana satu yang cantik mana satu tak for free
you ingat photoshop senang you ingat photoshop senang
tak kenapa you cakap dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
kenapa you berbual dengan I macam I tak tahu photoshop
you talking to someone yang belajar photoshop so why you saying that guy that way
yang mop canteen mop canteen
you know what reminds me of my sekolah time sunrise sunrise sunrise kan a'ah sunrise
is a kitchen so you have to clean up our clean up is like thorough clean up as well um sapu
lepas tu mop lepas tu cuci all the pan pots all wash
no flour on it make sure there's no dust or flour it just like okay and then jap when you cakap macam gitu teringat macam oh okay macam sama kat sekolah aku pun sama bikin gitu
know the rubbish bin all that right err so kita again ah upper aside those ya not so basically we will most of the time we will ask like
um everyday we have our own leader you know everyday we have you know like if if if apa ni primary school ke secondary school prefect prefect secondary school
eh secondary pun ada eh
so like prefect kan macam everyday kita ada prefect dekat sekolah tu walaupun it's already a a
ikut dia punya register number something like that so it's not loser basically this person do right is like everyday dia akan assign like
okay the four of you will do the pots and pans the four of you will mop the four of you will do this ataupun okay the four of you will collect the ingredients the flour and put on top okay the four of you
there's a term for that we don't call monitor or president other term other term I lupa apa chef entah apa chef I lupa but I hate it when it comes to my turn
no I'm not I'm the most macam no um the most shy because like in the morning I have to be talking to all of them like as if like I'm the leader sia I have to talk like okay I'm the leader you guys have to listen to me I'm not that kind of person what I'm not
so macam bila part I jer macam macam mana ah macam mana ah everytime is my turn I will be like ah shit I'm so scared I'm so scared I will get like anxiety macam
panic uh macam mana macam mana but the hal is everytime dah dapat tau everytime dah dapat because it rotates what
even if I don't want to lead then I'll be like macam on lah very on very kiasu you know
tapi kan macam ini macam tak ada pilihan langsung everyday orang rotate orang yang ada yang lagi pemalu daripada I
yang very shy super timid ada that one also like
but that we as a as the dia punya classmate tak ada macam
wah this one wah rabak sia cannot sia cannot sia we don't kita akan macam
for for example lah nama dia michelle eh michelle we would encourage her would be macam michelle it's okay you tell me what you want me to do you tell me I sitting beside you you tell me
ya time sekolah that's why I really love at sunrise you know at sunrise it's like the most amazing school I mean okay maybe the school is not really amazing tapi I punya classmate is the most amazing classmate ever so I macam happy gila
time secondary school primary school jangan cakap lah paling merepek
huh okay part buli in singapore is not that rabak hmm kalau buli in malaysia is the most rabak eh
okay lah let him be lah okay I don't know what happen to him now it's been years already hopefully okay dah berubah
I still feel so stupid you know I'm like I'm I'm staying at choa chu kang tapi asal I jauh
I apply something at balestier I do not know why got the other one at balestier and then suddenly balestier ni pindah for the second year pergi dekat yang college central
hujung sekali kalau kelas you hujung sekali your canteen is hujung sini
to my defense I didn't know sebab bila I uh apa apply for this sekolah dia orang cakap oh this diploma is recognisable everywhere in singapore outside of singapore is recognisable wah but when apply kerja horrible
no they do not recognise ah apa private diploma singapore don't recognise private diploma even kawan-kawan I yang kerja
eh yang
yang apa yang M yang macam you know is private juga kan ataupun apa
entah lah that one private also kan that one also not recognise tau sebab private
tapi is like quite the amount is so much for a private but then end up you don't use my for you you korang bagi kerja korang tak nak accept
takde lah
takde lah culinary job is I understand
so I understand that part is like macam okay lah but then
so now you are saying like okay you do not know what is happening okay so I bilang
basically alah macam banyak job banyak jer orang yang tak ada kerja but I tak tahu lah maybe I'm looking at the wrong places mungkin my agents are not really good
no ya that's why like most of them macam I wanna leave singapore I don't want to stay at singapore or something but to live at singapore you need job honey
a'ah like dia cepat-cepat sangat dia progress

future kids you know future grandchildren you know dia orang akan dapat macam a lot of privileges lah and then same time makan maju lagi cepat dari kita lagi

okay so ni lisa ni like how I don't think the the
I I've I seen phone cases where you can um like print macam pictures on the phone case I'm thinking that you are saying like macam a picture sort of thinkers the frame pictures that's what
that's what sarah is saying right and then ah dekat
plaza sing there is um the kedai tingkat dua depan pizza hut where you can make
ya correct kalau macam can
a tote bag with our pictures then they go to like macam supermarket
macam aww I have my tribe with me while I go buy some bawang
photo book you you you are right cause I have friends who give me photo book I look it on memories aww then cry then after that taruk dalam kotak and then like
when you clean up your house baru buka oh ya I remember this rachel give it to me two years ago ah what
I think kita like err we can just do
okay I think got like dua minggu to
the way she's guarded now is like ah whatever ah sembarang ah on ah go jer like she she she ya
eh lighter mana like lighter mana
ya ya ya and then I just she she tried to be the again the the the kakak kakak like trying to make jokes I was just like
ya ya I I nearly had that with sarah with the whole bali thing with the whole tini and the bali thing and all that cause I I macam
meeting tini was just like a coincidence thing cause she dia dia kerja dekat the hostel kat mana ni clarke quay then I was working kat lima pe
so I I know that tini has been like a bit emoish on her facebook and what not so I'm like eh babe come ah lepak ah like
ah apa ni aku habis kerja pukul lima like we can just like hang out eh no that time habis kerja siang two or three so we just smoke like by the side of like haji lane and then she just goes on and on about what had happened in bali when me and azmi left so when me and azmi was there and we asked her face to face even
jas was there with us tak ada apa-apa lah no lah nothing dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas that kind of thing so we went back to singapore cause like sarah was heads head over heels like macam orh this jas guy is nice memang he he he is a very lepak guy to hang out and all that and then we told her babe
I think he's just being a gentleman I think he really got nothing with tini cause we asked tini face to face so all these while when tini like when we when me and her hung out ah like she like oh dekat bali this happened and then he give me all these
tini macam ah macam oh dia cakap gini dia cakap gini pasal sarah and it was just lies cause I know what is happening on sarah side as well
this fucking dia dia lupa pe sial kita like in a group ya correct then um like she just keeps on talking and talking and talking like all the way until back to my house I was just I I I I swear to god I just diam I just cause she she
ah she was just basically macam member lah eh jas gini gini gini I don't know I have ah macam you know commitment issues tini like of course lah kan dia dengan dia punya commitment issue blah blah blah and then you know ah this happen and then she's like oh jas told me dia pergi lepak dengan kawan dia after the tipsy cow and I knew that was not was happening cause I knew that jas went back with sarah hey cause dia lupa sia correct then I
when I hear all these things from tini I'm like bullshit bullshit sial lah dia ni puki betul budak
so at some point no we hung out kita lepak dari pukul dua tiga
sabar sabar sabar sabar so
at at some point tini said this sentence um jas cakap dengan aku um macam uh I never felt like this for a girl before dia cakap gitu that that didn't happen just last weekend like at tipsy cow right
this is what's happening with him and sarah and then tini just went full on bitch mode and that was what happened that night he wanted to follow she wanted to talk to sarah hari tu juga dia nak berbual dengan sarah babe
I don't think it's okay for you to come not like this we don't talk to sarah now cause it's just not gonna happen like we are gonna go out tak apa tak apa tak apa boleh berbual lah dia cakap gitu then at at some point I told sarah sarah
cause what me and azmi told her was that actually jas and tini tak ada apa-apa but when we were there memang they really like
they they told me to they told to our face eh tak ada apa-apa dia tidur bawah aku tidur atas
ya jas dengan tini and then when we left back when me and azmi left first then they stay in bali apparently something happened and jas is just telling bullshit to her lah
ah so dia masih dia dia fikir dia casanova this guy sana like that so um
she just went her minah lah she did became the minah
err dia salahkan jas but she wanted to like talk to sarah and like what the fuck is going on like that ya so ah ya then then that night happened and
ya then I'm like kau nak pergi berbual dengan sarah buat apa kau pergilah berbual dengan jas I say like that dia yang buat problem pe like I was so angry
ya and then that was another awkwardness so sarah got pissed at me cause she thought I was badmouthing about her to tini which was not the case at all so when I had a one on one talk with err sarah I think like one or two weeks later it was just me and her at and dekat rumah dia dekat yang percil tu ah we we lepak we hung out
ah I am what was the word she used um macam berbual belakang dia ah like talking about her like that then I said no that was not the case this was what happened and my intention was not to stir up shit or talk about you behind her back and she felt like that cause before that there was the whole um
about what happened with them yes so these two things she thought like aku rattle mouth but the first one also then I said I understand what you're feeling about like the bash but really my intention at that point of time
you can you you can ask azmi you can ask nisa or whoever was there at your birthday lah that was your birthday right my intention was really eh sarah this this happened to sarah okay sekarang like how like what we gonna do about this like how can we help her
you know it was real but for her I overstep the line the fact that she told me and azmi in confident and I go out macam to her aku
ah macam lan jiao wei pasal dia babe I I told and I look at her in the eyes
I just wanted to help you and she said she didn't she didn't need help I'm like okay so from the conversation ah what I macam ah what I ah take from it is that ah sarah and sarah is dia always takut err she put put this image of herself that's not nice I feel lah this is just my personal
um macam um how to say eh macam um
no no no like macam dia jaga conduct
like like her way her her image is dia nak kena jaga conduct she don't like people talking about her cause I don't know maybe she has her own demons or anxiety and all that right so she correct no one ah ah I totally understand like I'm her friend babe I fucking love her you know like I will not do that and I
so I I I I I went back home and not nangis to azmi but macam I felt so I felt guilty of course that she felt like that right how can I not babe you know but then at the same time I told azmi that I I I I know this is my niat but sometimes kadang-kadang niat baik but um you know it it just people will not understand or to to that someone it's how they see it
from then onwards I I macam I ah back off sort a little bit to really
ya ya correct cause correct tini told me ya sorry tini tini told me that um macam I've I don't open up to guys one like I've had this issues for years correct and when she she that's why she senyap this is the reason why she's being very quiet so this this all adds on to it and
um like I I get where she's coming from as well but then like that day she didn't turn up for the the birthday thing the the the laksa thing we were having I was pissed off lah I feel like macam you put it out there like people are get you trying to get to you macam nak buat sial kat kau you know but
fuck you up who would not do shit behind your back who still eh jom ah lepak even though for months you been eh come ah we pick for you freaking put her name on a cake babe no no thank you no sorry no what sort like
kau cakap dengan aku pasal something I don't go to ni
ah no I will never I I I will not it it is never my my macam um my intentions to ah
we and it for us like sometimes oh we talk about tini macam gini
but gossip is kau tahu dia ni
um in our macam friendship in the sense that for her to me is the trust which I for me macam
ah hati dia like she wants to jaga her feelings blah blah blah so I which I I
eh bilang aku bilang aku you know
friends if you don't fight then something is not right that means you're just saying things to the other person you know you need to gaduh ya and any relationship will have that macam you know macam ah ah apa err what what's that word ah friction exactly right and then it's how you talk about how it is after that how that person react
you know like how you you you take it you know whether you you make it big or things like that but I feel like is is is it's it's inevitable to gaduh in any relationship
ya it's not like there's no point of time where apa aku cakap too much then you don't tell me there are times like that vice versa you know it's like
kan pasal semua kena nak cakap kena beralas ah nak cakap nak kena
like you lah kita nak main game tak nak main ah jangan banyak cakap
kalau azmi lagi whoa
no I think he's macam sial
why why kenapa like why are you so macam anti natural things
ah macam ginger ke balms

actually it's very funny I was cause last weekend we were talking about kalau kita dah tua like duduk mana like you know and we just lepak somewhere where you know there's the sea or something you know um I was I was it's just funny I was just thinking about this if really like money is
sort of macam not a problem sort of right like I would probably macam ah tanam basil tanam
thyme tanam apa err daun bawang lah apa lah you know shit like that and then I will learn it on youtube cause like hello everything is on youtube so it's everywhere exactly ya there's facebook groups you can just join and like eh apa pasal aku punya aku punya daun ni macam senget tepi or something like that you know like
and then I will just I would probably I I picture myself like okay if let's say kat indonesia ke malaysia right
mmhmm just go to like a local school like you know ah ah ajar english ke
riding things like that macam dah sapu rumah
sapu then like err eh jom ah so time to go teach english or you know
lepak ya ya ya I see myself
ya but also it's difficult to jaga ant
he will just macam the kind of macam romeo
jangan bang jangan jangan bang ow jangan bang
main jer
pangkeng pangkeng balik rumah uncle pangkeng
then macam save duit satu minggu sekolah
save lima dollar lima dollar weekend pangkeng ah
ya it's a term that ah like minah
or you naik rumah uncle ah
rumah uncle apa sia rumah uncle
ah rumah uncle balik rumah uncle rumah uncle
or like another matrep err slang ah aku kicap kau eh gua kicap sama lu
muka kau kasih kicap eh
terus macam kau I remembered the first
time someone used that word kampung
but err we we wrote letters to each other right cause dulu tak ada tak ada social media
you know asal kau berbual dengan dia ni ah
then I'm like ah kita tulis surat ah then after that she's like tak ada sekarang kau kau dari mana punya kampung
gua mahu turun sekarang then
apa sia kampung
then she like kau kampung pun tak tahu sial kau ah kampung dia cakap gitu
terus aku then I felt so uncool I put down the phone and then I go ask my kakak angkat what is kampung so apparently ah kampung is like ah
kau budak mana it's like where are you
ah which gang are you from or like which area are you from you from like that lah then I was like oh abeh kira kita ni kampung apa aku tanya kakak angkat aku
and then ah she like kita budak marsiling ah cause last time I stay with my with my auntie ah in in woodlands vista point area then budak kita budak marsiling ah
then in my head in this secondary one two tak nak ah marsiling tapi kita tinggal woodland jauh seh dengan marsiling
I jalan and everyone that is that that like under the block and all that kan dia macam you can see from their face macam ni budak ni bukan dari sini so they will like try to see how you dress
got one guy go down tangga saw me
and then dia macam stop in the middle of tangga then I'm like uh turun jer lah kan
every one or two days there'll be raids there will be ya it's not even like macam old airport road like the raids once a month kind of thing here it's like every few days there are raids cause it's the border thing ah ya so like that
ya marsiling punya
marsiling gua kicap sama lu budak toa payoh
that one cina cina one ah I think
my client's house like you can just see people sitting at the staircase ya and then I like when I go out they look at me macam cause
their their eyes is like apa kau buat kat sini so I always make sure the next time to like bring files and bring
this group of boys tak ada judgment I I am surprised I think cause they are like
cause we we came from normal phones to social media right but they they are in the heart they are the woke sort of people so they they are more they they their eyes is more of like macam
ya then they bring the boy down suddenly cause we we tell them like if they just want to read for ten minutes fifteen minutes that's good enough kids first like boleh duduk diam like what sepuluh minit lima belas minit
but after that if they want to go down they want to lepak so they bring this boy to the playground main catching babe
main catching dengan budak-budak kat playground main bola main apa then I'm like
they even suss out um not influencers but artist sort of from other schools macam not famous but like one one thousand two thousand followers
and they do hip hop ke beatboxing they gather all these people come to hwa chong and they did a fundraiser all the money that we pay is like five dollars ten dollars goes to real life stories

aku tak tahu ah actually I feel like
aku tak tahu mana nak makan sia these days I feel like
oh aku nak cakap dengan kau just now okay so like since last week ah
I aku everyday datang balik sekolah to like do do my work
I started off early then at first the all all my paintings look good at first then tiba-tiba aku just macam
aku keep telling myself that aku ada banyak masa
then end up like push push everything until macam friday which is the set up day ya then aku last minute rush abeh like
dia dia macam confident gila lah that then she she was proud of her work
then uh all this while she okay lah I can see her effort ah that she did she did put in a lot of effort tapi dia punya dia punya
then dia berbual pasal hijab
then I I like I genuinely thought she would get good grades lah tapi tadi time assessment dia kena buat rabak gila ya
then err because err my work is painting paste dengan aku add four D element which is projector lah then err mm aku aku end up being the last because
I had to set up my mini projector then it's energy saving what so kirakan aku aku end up from register number five to aku jadi last
ya then aku nervous gila ah because like everybody like already presented then you know how like if you go first you cannot be compared with anybody then your if you are the last they see everyone's one even the good ones the bad ones they see everything already ya
ya then turns out they they they really like my work ya tapi like aku aku like just macam like because I felt like I didn't really do well you know
so dia dia leave lah in the middle of the
the presentation then err mm cause my artwork aku berbual pasal family then I don't know if it's because it's a very sensitive topic that's why dia orang macam tak berbual sangat pasal aku punya but then but then again right I had another classmate who like
err dia berbual pasal family then dia kena rabak script
lagi pun dia tak ada dia tak ada script
ya dia just berbual kan then she fumbled over her words ya ya
tiga because satu dapat err I don't know why but
err from the start dia cakap dia ada dengue

ya then then he obviously had to stay home lah but it's been like since august sampai sekarang

really really like like gila babi sia
entah eh macam banyak gila like like everywhere
rabak rabak dok mahal gila sekarang like dulu eh dulu time kita potong rambut eh
aku rasa seven eight dollars ah or even lesser ah five dollars ah maybe sekarang basic haircut jer dah at least dua puluh like twenty dollars like walao eh jialat heavy
basic lor for me I look at it like very basic orh like entah simple ah potong jer ah biasa jer ah
ya ah I mean if like the normal normal people lah like you know like the neighbourhood people all confirm scared one lah sia like last like you know you go to pakcik-pakcik place last time like very welcome you know pakcik-pakcik like more
lepak then they talk about mat rock mat rock all music all
I cut at home I got shaver right then I alamak how to cut ah ah one time ah one time ah one time ah botak ah botak ah botak simple ah I mean tak keluar pun duduk rumah lepak rumah jer lek-lek ah
um most of the time entah eh lepak makan err
exercise chey step badan badan step abang body ah step ah it's don't know like really exercise ah bo pian leh like
I tell you stay at home you confirm fall sick one ah rabak gila sia
every night I think we we we did like macam apa
covered thirty days thirty days sial wah gila babi sia thirty days
gila thirty days
so you see them from a virtual screen macam everyone dalam kotak-kotak sendiri so pelik ah but
ya ya pity them ah that one rabak ah or people who are you know alone lonely ah nobody to talk to ah wah
stop lah not say stop lah like there's still a lot of restriction ah I know there's a at least we still can now can at least go out meet people or you just be out alone you know just lepak lepak or what but of course keep a safe distance lah
ah then at least people you know it's good to be outside ah like you stuck at home wah mati sia mati mati mati confirm mati one but but but good lah we can go out
ya I heard ah rabak eh rabak sia like that one hour or maybe they have a few few hours only to go out then very strict wah rabak rabak but rabak one is in india ah wah the police rembat sia the police wah that one that one really rabak ah the police rembat the people who go out but then you know it's not supposed to be that way lah but then what to do they have to be very strict right but hopefully it's not going on now lah
entah semua busy semua macam
busy ah biasa lah family people
wan G also work busy he also dia baru cakap sikit hari rabak sia kerja macam recently start rabak ah after public holiday macam err apa kerja daripada pagi dia start pukul sepuluh habis pukul satu pagi that kind
ah kat rumah orh
work from home orh ah rabak gila like rabak gila
but tak tahu ah but dia dapat keluar weekends ah but I think weekends also he go out also spend time with wife orh like what else he can do right
tak tak isyad pun ada cakap juga the part wan G wan G turun sekejap ah but entah I think they got family event ah ke apa entah tak tahu ah but tak kesah ah at least they go out ah
lama gila dok
aku rasa the last kita jam before circuit breaker atau
kita tak jam terus lepas balik yang vietnam punya show lama lama gila lama gila babi
like semua semua put on hold lah okay lah but at least other bands macam ada jam ah like space ya quite active lah like no cause we also we we also
like take some time off just to do the mixing lah but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first lah cause dah lama gila seh like hold back kita punya recording
entah tengok ah tapi dah habis ah dah habis mix dah habis finally habis ah like dah swee ah tinggal hantar mastering then lepas tu
tak tahu we still finding for for people lor um
tak ah err overseas ah
tak tahu dorang boleh dapat sound dia ke tak
kalau haji hussin boleh
err oh tu dia punya mixing mastering suite eh
tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang ah try to talk to them we also finding ah we will be sitting down
I don't know ah that's the plan ah I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like kita release macam all one shot kan nanti macam people get bored easily ah like ah so kita punya style gitu ah I mean is four songs only apa it's not it's not like a whole album lah if whole album then
what what's the whole concept ah you know what I mean the whole concept of the is macam is all err is is interconnected ah is like err is like err macam a story ah from song number one to song number four
ah yes concept album so semua macam interconnected ah there's a story to it ah
so kita plan macam release song by song right then every song ada different artwork
budget ah see what kind of concept lah then also must pay for mastering err then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see ah we'll see how it goes ah pelan-pelan ah pelan-pelan kayuh ah
tapi dia still macam part of it pe part of us dia tak keluar like know tak keluar in a bad terms dia keluar in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning pe ya so then tak kesah ah then we will we'll see how ah kita nanti duduk berbual we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
entah tengah rabak juga ah
pasal dia was working dekat mana eh
dia was working dekat
then lepas tu err circuit breaker dia kena laid off just like that
baru masuk orh baru masuk like I think one month plus two months ah
then kena laid off so dia struggle ah but I think he's doing graphic design and also food delivery ah but okay eh the food delivery actually actually cannot help cannot help ah
so not bad ah I mean simple don't want to make it over very overly mix if not like rabak sia like like overly produced
duh rabak rabak rabak rabak rabak that one rabak but okay lah we see lah
tu lah
tapi aku rasa kalau touring kan confirm tak so soon punya confirm lama lagi seh
aku tahu aku tahu aku tahu pasal siti nak kahwin
tu ah abeh macam mana kacau mesti kacau punya abeh macam mana orang nak kahwin
tapi kau dah set seh
aku rasa dia masih cakap the the only girl in the family
tapi depends ah individual pe tapi tak tahu ah tak tahu tak tahu apa pasal lah eh but maybe sekarang memang period dia nak tak tahu aku tak tahu maybe dorang buat grand ke tapi
ya but entah lah eh
I think he doesn't show ah he doesn't show that he needs to struggle lah but but before that dia he was okay what when he he haven't got he was going to get married I I
oh ya lah beli rumah cause rumah expensive but then got pe
ya aku tak tahu tapi
but then again both kerja full-time pe full-time should be able to sustain apa macam kalau you say you like freelancer okay ah of course ah that one jialat but but full-time confirm every month you will get
tapi pun depends ah if how big of a house you want to buy ah I mean if you technically if you one time you want to buy one big house of course it's quite expensive lah but if you start small anyway houses you can sell what you know some people will start small buy three room first ah
if not ah if us ah walao confirm confirm huru-hara one macam apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni apa ni
nanti aku depressed dengan duit orang dengan aku sendiri stress seh eh macam mana ni
tapi tu rabak juga sia kalau dia cabut
tapi estee power ah estee pandai manage ah
but entah lah
tapi okay lah band band aku missy shoot pun
missy shoot pun nak record lah so tapi kita take it easy pasal sekarang I mean hakim is busy with work rabak gila aku macam dah beberapa minggu sia tak jumpa dia ajak lepak tak jumpa ajak lepak tak jumpa
dia jam dekat sini tapi dia actually tak reply message
bila dorang book
dia tengah busy
dia so dorang tak ada dia dorang message dia tengah busy dia tak dia tak dia tak dia tak reply pasal tengah busy kan so dia belum cakap dia okay ke tak then suddenly they book
they book already ah dorang dah book huh serious ah dorang dah book semalam aku tak reply sia
then dia turun ah tu pasal aku rasa dia lambat cause dia kena settle family benda punya pe I mean he work also busy already then he needs to spend time with family so bo pian ah
ya tapi okay lah but missy shoot pasal kita selalu jam also on weekdays jadi dia pun tengah busy tapi kita tengok lah but definitely the plan is to record at least by
hujung tahun ni ah
tak tahu ah
I think sial is very influential macam banyak influence err orang-orang probably also cause of
dia female fronted
abeh and then nyanyi malay lagu melayu
then very very strong musical apa
bagus juga rare juga nampak band macam gitu like playing macam
betul aku realise that juga
I mean aku ikut korang yang time europe tour aku realise actually aku get to see many things
but then again I think the twenty four hours pun macam can feel the vibe lah pasal you are still macam dekat another country orh then you see like even though macam say for example eh for example kau main germany ah but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different ah
so at least you get to see that culture know macam berlin really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very ni and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very kampung like in kampung ah but then
macam save cost ah kau tak payah spend duit on macam err apa lodging dorang will kasi kau crash tempat dorang I mean that's the give and take ah you know
I mean I think dia maybe that his style ah if he don't like that culture or not say culture ah he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go lah
ah same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks ah two weeks pun dah cukup
cause kalau tak rabak sia kau
cause aku realise siti is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social apa instagram
she can travel alone dia boleh travel alone pergi macam
ah tu pasal ah
gila cause aku realise cause bila that time kita dekat london tu then dia willing to go jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai explore seh like like she knows her way ah like to to just explore ah dia tak takut she got she's fearless ah but I think
that something yang holding her back ah
ya but tak tahu ah
aku pun nak tour lah dengan macam urgent matter I mean missy shoot lain sikit lah pasal kalau nak tour
probably lagi susah lah pasal lal pun macam iman's league right and then it's very
it'll be hard lah I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was iman's league ah then he came back so but I think he he still very on lah he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask eh does this ni kena tak
then macam tak ah ni tak kena ah ni very very iman's league ah okay tak apa then dia akan tukar to change to kita punya vibe
selalunya is dol or most of the time is dol lah
he he he did give some ideas err when we take in some ideas some ideas macam tak kena lah pasal it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into macam very rubik's vibes
you know ah dia macam
err but he will try to control he he don't want to macam dia tak nak tukar the sounds
ah bad religion I mean influence ah cause we influence with bad religion abeh macam influence with rise against dol punya influence is heavily rise against
heavy lal is very melodic guy lal suka melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with macam he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he dia banyak macam on that vibe but aku is more very bad religion penny wise ah
ah propagandhi err that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but bagusnya everything is jumble up you see so semua dah jumble up semua dah macam
biasa ah
but entah eh
dia macam very err straight kan
tapi dorang tak tahu ah zul dah tak cakap dengan ni ah dengan bob ah eh practise ah single pedal aku feel playing single pedal
yang buat dia very unique ah dia macam unique gila ah but then ah to each its own ah style ah ya but see ah see ah I don't know ah we still got a
betul dorang dah boring ah
bad religion still stick to that sound but then ada modern element I feel ah that's how I feel
he got a vibe ah a different vibe I still like bad religion ah cause dorang
cause they very abang abang
I don't know ah he some pop punkers like feeling feeling tapi macam
entah very kental ah I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing ah
tapi tengah set ah
then will send us then cakap okay err ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit
err then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then bila time jumpa baru like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then dah lah see how pasal kita record with no clicks then very simple err
miking macam drums only four mikes err so that's why some sound macam really tak boleh dapat and stuff lah but we this is like a trial ah for me lah it's a trial ah but then nanti tengok ah like in future future recording kita do it like better ah
cause hakim macam dah offer eh next recording aku aku will make sure like all the all the miking will be better lah
ya lah that's why dia dia discovered tu pasal that time actually dia offered to macam eh macam kau nak rerecord balik kau punya drum but then
ah but then aku cakap eh tak ada click orh we don't play with click so it's gonna be susah sia like okay lah we try ah I did record like what um we tried half a song ah but it's difficult cause there's no click
tak feel ah like tak feel ah so then I think then I told him next time ah like the next time we we we try to record
cause he discover but good thing that but good ah he's very hardworking dia discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input lah but then again it's not a bad recording ah this time
correct but then have to be patient ah but then but then again for example this spacedays punya
spacedays punya vibe is because we we needed to
big one the big one tall one ah bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish balik err for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
dia rajin gila ah ya but good lah know he he he he invests on that lah he invests on that then to have like
then apa tu force vomit pun tengah record
ah then recently dia cakap last week eh last week dia cakap dia record dikir barat
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this ranggi ranggi guys ah ranggi is the motorcycle macam
ah so ranggi is actually macam um
ranggi is err some of them ada budak-budak dikir barat ah
so I think dorang
abeh hakim is a buat sounds pe
so dia macam pergi dekat dia lah but then banyak lah then it's like side bazaar bush man dia punya side project
adib I think adib playing bass err then got err um restam bushman main guitar then err rizal rizal dulu main sound of province rizal main sound of province dulu
rizal kecil
he covered ah session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer lah then dia main for this band aku tak tahu siapa lagi a few more guys ah like play for his band
so dorang macam rerecord balik ah ya
um but then financially maybe tak sangat lah
tu lah
tu pasal lah tak aku cakap dengan zad juga zad dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh then tiba-tiba macam korang main semua cakap zad kau nak pakai pakai ah kau nak pakai pakai ah eh tak boleh ah kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah ah pakai jer it's a wear and tear thing
aku tahu dia mahal but then I'm giving you that that green light apa that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay ah understand sometimes people don't want to terhutang budi kau tahu
tak maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe dulu dia pernah macam have this friend who like okay just use ah then after that after using already then like eh wah now I want to you never give me back macam you know
jialat ah jialat got friend ah but then tak tahu ah but I'm okay ah kalau zad nak pinjam
dah ah
tapi end of the day also all the stuff macam like it's a wear and tear punya benda pe so
tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah eh you also broken what it'll also break what like know like so it's okay lah I mean the thing is
ya that's why kesian sia I know he's been macam dia berbual dengan aku ah like cannot wait sia I cannot wait to play drums sia
ah I cannot wait to lepak I cannot wait to record you know I told him lah if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us lah we can help you set up the mic setting ah
like I know he don't want to terhutang budi that's confirm and maybe his style is different dia takut macam dia
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold eh macam don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt what hurt the feeling hurt what so I don't think he's like that
but kita dah cakap ah I mean I already told him also eh kalau kau need to record you need help you just call us lah ah we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you ah cause you is is is you are the one doing the work
we here just to help lepak
sekarang mesti dia rabak gila seh dekat rumah tapi tengok ah
no but the thing is this type of thing right the walk right you cannot pikiran you know just go regret lepas tu ah regret after that ah but there's no regret ah I mean for me personally when I went err the walk was was rabak ah the starting was fun cause everything but
no but she also was struggling ah cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like eh guys guys sekejap sekejap sekejap stop stop stop aku tak boleh aku tak boleh ah so we actually sat down and azil macam okay no problem no problem duduk
then it was like matahari dekat mata the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then kita macam eh kita rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we lek sekejap lek sekejap
rabak ah for me ah personally but I told them sorry ah I say paiseh paiseh ah like we have to have a lot of stops
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle ah ah so we did manage to finish ah so the moment we touch that thing right kita cakap kita sampai right
macam macam azil we made it ah we just high five sia
eh take photo take photo take photo lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan I lie down already sia I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks azil take out socks take out shoes aisyah also sit down then all termenung already like good twenty minutes
eh hafiz fetching ah jalan to the punggol settlement there is like another one click ah
one point five click ah betul
rabak ah
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already ah like oh dah penat ah dah penat ah dah penat ah mata dah rabak I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also malas you know like want to minum air just drink water ah drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually hamimah zafran all they wake already they wanted to go makan
ya lah breakfast but cause aisyah ah hafiz fetching aisyah mah so they wanted to go makan then they ask you and nazril kau dengan nazril plan ah nak pergi makan mana then kita jumpa somewhere tu aku cakap eh tak boleh ah
kita nak balik tidur balik tidur ah nak balik tidur
so hafiz fetch us fetch actually wanted to fetch fetch aisyah then we wanted to grab home then hafiz cakap eh tak apa ah aku hantar korang ah
dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari toilet aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah slow gila then aku duduk aku duduk macam eh sia ah to go into the car also macam eh sia ah rabak sia ni
ah apa oh ya ya cause coastal
twenty one eh like like almost twenty clicks ah actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way err hud told me is about twenty five clicks ye
tak but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
that sengkang we thought you is after that bridge thought the sengkang is already punggol sekali eh bukan it's another sengkang
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector dia macam sampai dekat red bridge tau but this one is before red bridge kau dah belok kiri
is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
ya so I work from home for macam
then I feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why I rather work kat
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
that's why I tadi I ask you to take a picture of your your working setting
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah I will just like duduk depan depan then my laptop
oh make the home macam office like that ah
oh then what your wifi around your houses eh around your houses around the house macam good ah
ya lah then how you do your work seh macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai pakai pakai apa Microsoft or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out meh macam never lag or what
ya so now buat apa
oh you've been working part time kerja apa eh cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
but you are still working what okay lah tu means you dah survive sikit
kerja apa why you never explain
oh pack apa
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga kan
kerja kat mana kat warehouse eh
uh at ibu cik house lah the difference right
one week and then you cannot tahan
it's just too fast paced ah macam mm
ya one day berapa
if you are at the first first person ah then paling senang
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy ah
macam from
pack for eh no we start at about oh macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
uh scoop the kuah then after that you kiap the container then you
ah pack kat kitchen ah so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas lah then when you kiap the container then you also will kiap your finger lah
bla bla lah then lepas balik
I mean the the packing place yang I kerja is um
express gila lah especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat seh
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa seh kerja malam
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
ya so kerja apa
then kenapa you leave
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy one
okay then kerja ini kat mana
oh dekat lah
pukul sembilan eight thirty
you've been closer right every time sekarang I always saw you and
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when I see your InstaStory macam eh
apasal seh
oh gitu eh macam mata merah ah kirakan
like jealous ke like oh I have a boyfriend but you don't like err
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy faham lah that's the thing
meet tapi masih berbual kan
like on Whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
bagus ah
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
together and individually so macam okay ah let's say ah so ah cause sekarang dia dah right
oh that recent stories dia tak appear lah that kind of thing okay okay
cause ah dia sekarang work as financial adviser
uh you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat ah itu jer
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
mm so that is his career so his career now kan dia ah dia
uh gender and everything else so macam
kita is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
ya ya so ah so macam macam mana eh
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his pun pernah happen I don't know eh
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
so uh basically dia dia bilang me Hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu I thought
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling err bad
his dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
wow macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay lah sakit hati tu sakit hati lah tapi at least
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
ya but that someone that lady dia macam
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my no ah like
memang dia they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
like made a move lah macam message lah message the perempuan nak nak know better
kelakar kan
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good lah macam macam he he he he tell me things like err I want to explore he don't want to feel
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
betul lah ya lah professional that part it is lah but at the same time dia nak
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing tu juga I said macam I I say to him ah I also can say the same thing to you what but I choose to focus what is in front of me
from the start of the relationship I got even I pernah bilang you what bila kita nak
boleh lah I mean you nak comment pun comment lah because honestly
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so macam
macam okay
macam dependent lah
bukan macam okay so
ya ah so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
it's stupid lah tapi macam
ya lah faham lah
dia belum kan
ya lah faham lah but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
get it macam
for me now with Han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
I don't know lah I really don't know I don't know whether kita are compatible or what already lah because dia memang dah ada other mindset juga
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no lah because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of Hans
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu but the uh
it has been weeks already ah so if I cry now also macam
it's just tears eh macam really legit sia so macam ya lah
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand lah
tak apa uh it's okay not to make assumption ah but
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree ah dia cakap
uh hmm no he I don't know dia cakap um why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just um be friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu mm
I mm only just now I met him lah after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then I asked ada siapa kalau ada Hans I say to them I tak nak join
mm tapi ya ini susah ah susah
she she sense it lah so macam mm
the group of friends yang I bilang pun macam
so this issue macam I really tak nak bilang orang but
ya tak lah I think pasal I'm just too macam
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
ya ah so ya dah itu jer lah
kadang kadang seh dalam kerja so macam if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out ah
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me kan ah what time you sleep and stuff right
twelve tahu
sometimes I habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu I'll just hang out talk I just like err but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so macam
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I baru balik that kind of thing then once I go home
then it affected my work in terms of productivity lah I lupa benda I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
ah your rumah macam tukar hari hari seh
then before raya I think I went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
it's only your room tak involved lah
but the thing is I don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya mm me me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
because this wifi sucks you okay for example ah kalau sekarang you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
I always do outside kalau tak I'll just do at other places
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
mm patutlah boleh lah gitu ya then I need to pasang one more loh
tak ada lah but
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy kan no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
like on the same track check in apa task you buat ah
macam gitu lah penat seh so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
macam gitu lah ya ya ya correct correct ya
err at pukul sepuluh no worry lah can can
err macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless ah I don't know lah apa lah
merepek gila ah because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
oh so you your pay macam mana bila internship

then after a while kan dia err
it got to a point that dia macam super nonsense
no but I um the the the first wife I don't know ah like apa motive dia buat macam gitu semua kan
dia nak apa revenge
so dia don't love the husband anymore
so dia just nak revenge only
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether dia fall in love with the colleague or
habis um so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her
then why the guy still jumpa with the shermaine and all
dia kan jumpa with the
the han so hee punya bapa

ah ya takpe ah
macam standard ah cakap english ah okay okay not bad

my dreams okay tak yah let it go into specifics ah but like my dreams would require to sacrifice most of my leisure time yes that's a brief description
aha that one is uh takpe lah
aku would want to be invisible
eh bocui sia nah tak payah tak payah we don't snitch
but what about kau
eh by the way kau watch uh umbrella academy
aku rasa they talking about like
kau tahu like
but it's like a natural thing ah for kau kan and some it's honestly called talent ah to be that smart at that young age
yes correct ah betul
so in a way pun kau like grateful lah for what has happened because it made you too because
a'ah overrated pun
aku still wouldn't hear it lah to be honest cause
but also don't need say ah cause kitanya radio our campus radio pun overplayed their songs ah
if kau realise
eh I wanted to join eh come on lah aku nak join sia
aku feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially kat Singapore kan kitanya country small
oh mak yes
low-key kalau ada ah eh
but kau imagine though
confirm yes correct betul betul aku agree
work is a an activity apa
ah we can call it a food lah that I know you won't be jelak of is sweets lah
because normal lah everytime aku nampak kau selalu makan gula selalu makan gula ada benda ah kat dalam mulut kau selalu
K kau rindu sekolah sangat ke huh
standard confirm oh yang that sebelah drink store that western the burger
betul lah betul lah cause before you eat with your mouth you eat with your eyes ah they say
but here's another thing though aku nak kena tanya kau
takde no such thing
dia kau dah check up
awal pe
ya I know aku dari tadi nampak ah so that's why but it's okay understandable
so kau boleh cakap dengan diri kau macam
takde I cannot
just a little bit just a little bit eh perang ah just a little bit jer
head ah kirakan head of department
but I mean actually not that bad especially yang that time ah
aku dengan cyprus kena caught kena kat toilet
err suruh jumpa miss tan mister adrian and that time mister adrian was a ah
then dia cakap dengan aku pasal all these actions
then dia cakap dengan aku oh your punishment is going to be you have to go to
no thank god he he just he just then I'm like eh serious ah aku stress sia twenty twenty class what the fuck
mmhmm eh macam tahu jer not bad macam tahu jer
ah a'ah sia lagi lagi NITEC let's be honest ah NITEC has more girls that higher NITEC that's a fact
ah sorry ada orang ada girlfriend takpe takpe takpe
I mean in a way kau boleh train kan that shit too
oh like macam straight away not bad
not only macam pasal discount price and shit cause
ah apa lagi soalan kau tengah tengok ni
dia ada berapa soalan sia
yeah that few is berapa lah
aku definitely heard of the word
apa ah
macam detective ah aku ingat aku ingat
but honestly ah aku like just like that ah the aircon on the bus
sekarang most to most yang buat joke is
aku lah
ah susah sia
okay ah but I understand uh pun kau have your own things going and you know I wish you well and shit lah
no the best time was when we were year one kat J seven
uh kau setakat kat belakang I don't know why you looking at fish hooks and okay lah that guy interested
ah ah aku masih ingat
but if I had known earlier that kau akan like you know quit soon
I mean aku understand lah aku understand
oh merepek
ah yes oh my god kau
that's why aku agree ah with kau on that
you are better off now kau tengah buat what kau love honestly we still keep in contact so that's also good lah
kau wait ah kau tunggu aku I think I got told you this before bila aku ada motor aku datang situ kalau tak kita lek lek jap
uh tak aku kalau lagi four more
tapi takpe kau tunggu jer
ah boleh boleh enjoy that's that's my main goal lah to be honest lah eh
ah fifteen minutes twenty fifteen minutes boleh ah fifteen minutes
if aku
aku not sure sia
do kau have something in mind I'm really not sure sia
especially kau dengar Converse seven to ten august that time
tak tahu tadi terhang sikit ah eh
I'd say looks ah cause honestly body you can do anytime but if your looks rabak kan and your face ah that's it got nothing to do already just give up unless
body can do anytime makan makan makan
how about kau
wah bagus bagus abeh honest eh
it's just aku rasa mainly cause of apa body type is it that kind of thing
ah yes I mean at that point of time pun kan so like kau just need more experience a little bit more experience that's all
kau tengah cakap pasal which food court ada
yes is it that one yang kau tengah cakap that food court
dorang taruk those uh what do they call that
like feed properly the chicken that kind of thing kan bukan macam give them some
air and
kau punya melayu hancur sia apa yang oksigen apa sia
I aku tak pernah sia cakap like oksigen like
ever in malay maybe that's why aku tak tahu ah this is my honestly my first time hearing it
exactly and the fact that macam mana eh all those dormitory workers
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
actually that's what they should do sia after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah kan and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang ah
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two jer semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap ah
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie lah
kau pun heard ah the reason they
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all
oh ya ya aku nampak
at least also like go out with a purpose are ada orang just keluar setakat untuk lepak
ah yes okay ya betul betul betul
kau nampak national day
as in like tak yah cakap ah
like a lot of people then aku nampak like a tweet on Twitter that says like
because nobody is following the safety measure rules whatsoever one metre apart takde jer semua lama just one big ass
ah takpe lah president
eh but area kau ada fireworks
but like you know romantics sikit who knows bring you to bali
I would like settle down if one country if one country aku boleh settle down kan aku would settle down at
have you seen the mountains there just online aku macam
but if kau nak peace you know do your work alone enjoy retirement shit
that place untuk aku is perfect ah
K the other side aku dengar it's like something about
aku nak quit sia aduh
but ni macam last minute ah aku didn't know that err our school provided a bursary
cause aku didn't know until miss tan text aku like
ya I think so but then aku fikir balik eh bukan aku dah nak graduate april oh sekarang jer baru dia nak bagi
oh nenek eh kau tinggal sorang kan dalam
asal room kau gelap sia kau tak
oh takde apa
subuh so technically kau should
aku nya time eh
dah habis out of stock so sad
wallet yang tu lah yang the sometimes by designer tu I wanted the the the apa tu oh gosh oh dusty pink I swear I tell abang syafiq to buy fast
tengok oh but this one bulky
the one that I want is very apa tu very tipis dia boleh macam is literally wallet tau and then when you put the phone behind dia tak nampak bulky but cannot use with err cover I think
not phone casing bag lah it's a it's a wallet bag dia ada put phone belakang and it has chain chain strap
tapi tu bulky seh
I can't find any know macam like boring dia punya stroller semua macam like not the one that I want and they mostly is pre-order so that day I want to buy on the spot
abeh takleh ah abeh apa
ya so you open is really very nice actually I like the stroller then me and my friend kan keep on cari-cari like which one we want then finally we found this one is very nice but it's super expensive lah but it's okay lah one time beli
dia tak lightweight it's very berat it's like eleven
abeh lepas tu err I like thinking lah whether to get or not because at first
cause at first macam there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that one like besar gila and then but that one can put two people in two babies two babies
your head lah how can you sit ya you see you see tengok tengok show me ya that one that one the the tu a'ah cantik kan that's why you you see the video it's
cantik kan ah actually dia ada another one it's called Nuna Mixx ini Nuna Mixx next yang Nuna Mixx tu dia fold sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh shorten so dia macam dia compact err so yang ni yang baru ni dia compact and very
apa tu dia fold just nice ah and it can stand on its own and then dia boleh recline sampai ah lay very flat untuk baby baring ya and then dia punya
dia punya canopy boleh tarik sampai kat bawah the canopy the tu the cover ye lah bila dia tidur then like sunlight right either that or you ah you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
like no you use up to six months after that lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi
it's meant for something like that lah macam is heavy or probably the height or weight is not ah suitable untuk dorang anymore
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that macam kalau I want to take grab ke apa ke
because only grab can use uh if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat kalau you take taxi tak payah car seat
cik usop kan kawan abah cik usop ah what oh my god my toe sakit gila skit gila
tapi why seh why is it even swollen eh
no lah I scared lah cause that time I also sakit kaki again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the dia nya tu
how it works ya you will see how how dia punya tu works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the belakang the belakang is meshed is like macam like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part lepas tu when she baring kan belakang dia dia boleh rasa ah panas eh apa the air and then this one also boleh buat like bassinet bassinet
because bawah dia punya feet area kan you can just snap out dia punya feet area tu then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that lah
abeh lepas tu I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar sebab dia colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because dia boleh pusing and baby can face me instead
ya and then like let's say lah macam err apa I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down dia tepi dia ada net ada meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the barang to sampai next week I think about seven days
what baju mm mm
oh this is the baju you say you wanted to pakai eh wanted to buy and then scared dia tak sampai on time
hais so many things oh I want to give away a lot of bags away those tu semua kat dalam box tu I don't know nak tengok ah bag aku yang nak giveaway how to do work like this haiyo
a'ah seh dia dah half lah
and then washing machine pun belum habis the washing machine haven't finish ah so many things to do need dia ada dryer kat dalam dia but ya dryer dia is not is not ah drying lah tapi nak kena like ya it's damp so you you still have to like you still have to sangkut sidai outside
outside ah but it's now raining so I think I'm just gonna put it here then maybe kalau balik rumah jurong I will just bring bring along kalau macam I stay lama ah
ah ya tapi eh tapi ni tak boleh masuk banyak kalau dia nak kalau dia nak basuh like like everyday dia basuh like dua tiga kalau jeans jeans susah ah
tapi laundry mat it's okay lah just get laundry mat lah better what can wash all satu kali ni wash dua tiga kali nak kena wash seh as in cause banyak kan so kalau baju baby okay ah baju baby
is very little and small so I will just dump everything masuk dalam tapi bila drying dia kan it's sikit sebab dia punya drying is dalam basket kecil tu you have to keep inside that basket kecil then kalau letak banyak-banyak it won't kering
I mean it's good cause kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan ya socks underwears all the small small ah ni lah T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see ah if he even if he wash this one right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to cuci to dry satu kali and is more saving lah dari dia pergi pergi bawah then washing machine and then after that you know oh no cuci is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash kat sini kat dalam washing machine ni
uniform tak boleh masuk ni busy uniform masuk dalam ni ada ah just have to search ada ada but masalahnya dia nak angkat benda tu ah pergi toilet everytime
orh okay lah ya he can there's there's a slightly bigger one like like maybe double the size of that ya tengok ah dekat lazada ke shopee ke ah no lah ezbuy don't want ezbuy lambat sampai tak habis-habis seh
I mean shopee sells everything oh you know semalam kelakar abang boy called me
he said that his shopee nya barang delivered tapi tak sampai cause he find cannot find the barang so so I said to him lah you contact the seller lah and say mm that the barang tak sampai then after that ah then I fikir balik confirm he he don't know how to do all these lah kan maksudnya never mind lah you give me what's the items yang missing and then your home address ah
lepas tu he he already give me everything then after that he call me again he say takpe zurah dah dah jumpa mak buang kat dalam storeroom because because mak thought it's sampah because it comes in a plastic yang macam ya so mak thought it's sampah nasib baik mak belum buang he just dump she just dump it inside the storeroom abeh the funny thing is arrisa tak
cakap dengan mak is is barang ni tau don't know ah maybe ah cause mak ambil buat masuk agaknya then arrisa also
it's either that or it's either that or the dia macam ah saw it saw it somewhere lah
it's funny then after that I arrisa also laugh I heard over the phone lah kelakar gila mmhmm then mak ingat sampah
nasib baik tak terbuang baju baby seh I think she bought baju baby
I told her go shopee buy all the stuff don't buy me then actually on that day yang datang sana I wanted to show her macam mana nak pakai so busy and all that nasib baik ibu dah tunjuk dia
then abang boy macam like ah pening kepala cause she will start buying stuff I say it's okay lah it's still cheap seh rather than you want to go kiddy palace so expensive
I don't know mana tahu
then you think my back not sakit meh sit like this no because my kaki is sakit that's why macam duduk gini I think I'm gonna feel the same thing like that time apa the my left my left thigh sakit so I need to
because dia macam tangkap belakang I don't know ah but it's so sakit like and now it's not so bad yang that time nya really very bad it's so painful
ya let's hope I put cream esok malam ni nak nak urut lagi

aura after this we mandi okay after this can go mandi lah can go mandi lah correct
but it's funny because I I do your right side more than your left side you know cause I cause tadi I put like that right then you see so fast ya then this side yang tak then this side I've been doing like I'm very careful
she wants to stay awake dah nak tertidur dah
eh sakit seh I think really ah my leg no no no my toe my toe my toe not my leg
cause the other side also hari tu sakit tapi orh this one more painful
that time sakit dua-dua tapi this one the left side is more painful
then I was like ni siapa seh at first I saw the name lah but the name kan bukan aiman dia letak dia letak is it aiman instagram

then I like see because macam macam dia still small seh abeh lepas tu kasi hundred fifty I feel like macam
tummy dia not that big what that time kasi ninety dah muntah-muntah aku kalau kasi semalam macam buat hundred twenty she never even finish she drink like fifty jer
that's why I say hundred fifty is the current it's the now right now nak kena buat hundred fifty then hundred twenty pun dia tak tak minum habis macam mana
first month pun kita kasi ninety jer tak kasi hundred twenty ya that one I know dia boleh reach that kind until that amount
ya because I'm worried that it's too much for her but then when I read the ikut the tin punya instructions eh because ah this week eh next week wait ah two more days she'll be eight weeks already so eight to twelve weeks is hundred fifty then I like shock seh macam huh why skip hundred twenty then suddenly hundred fifty apa seh
hundred twenty ah so now cause last time when she drink dia tak tak minum banyak kan macam dia tak habis ninety right I will start doing sixty so now if dia tak habis hundred twenty I will do ninety cause she has to increase apa she cannot stay sixty ninety she needs to go up to ninety hundred twenty okay we gonna drink like that untuk you okay

so my school starts actually for now it's like um tengah holiday semester one holiday then semester two starts like
october nineteen tu pun now is just only like semester one jer belum semester two then like it's still like year one so
macam I feel like year one ni lama gila
ya my friends also like nak ajak hang out also my friend you know sarah
she ada club so she sarah and nasrul ni uh both of them is club is school of applied science punya
ah is more like your own course habis is more of like leadership punya kind of
then um tak salah
sarah have like err apa ni event ah for their um for their so she's the one that like macam like overall in charge
so ada ada um ada ada groups yang kena buat event tu one is her group kena pilih another one is another group tapi nashrul punya group like um tak kena chosen and after like she's very busy with her club
until I don't know I think until next two week then after that next two week baru like we
I also have my own tapi tak apa lagi pasal malas
ya pasal malas
honestly I respect those people yang macam dia orang sudah like for two years
and then doing the same thing that budak poly buat then having to go through the same thing like for another three years kat poly it's just so tiring and exhausting ah that's why sometimes I actually understand for those people yang
selepas they choose to just work
apa ni uh studying in poly because it's very tiring honestly
poly kan macam also is like poly so like I feel like macam ni poly example I take it as eh having to do it for another three years it's just no I am not like
it's not like macam easy you know like for those people who really like um
buat the assignments the project the presentation having to do it the same thing all over again in poly is
salute those people who macam have the determination like and motivation to like just continue going to um poly ya
phase is just um submitting your diploma ranking course lah kalau your interview is fail then like for my friend sarah kan dia dapat interview so dia pass interview and then she already get her what ah her results that like she can go in like like her place for
um pharmaceutical science memang sudah chop chop for her so macam okay lah she sudah selamat she don't have to like focus on her grades you know because dia memang can already it's like
so macam kalau interview sudah pass then okay you can go doesn't have to look at your and all lah
but for me because my interview tak dapat
now focus solely on which is uh kita orang pasal kita orang tak ada exam also so they look
over um they oversee our daily grades for each module and each day macam for us kan ada orang like
um sekolah dia orang satu hari is like is combination of subjects but for me is like kalau math is
then after that kalau there's a mixture of A and B is banyak and like the A and B is a lot then after that your confirm like high is like um three to four
gitu then kalau macam C banyak gitu then maybe around two point five to three point five gitu then um
like baru berapa compared to my other two friend I think they did more better lah in a sense
my diploma ranking course also I put first as biomedical science and pharmaceutical and biotech memang nak try dapat biomed if like if cannot also I would go for pharmaceutical science like it's okay for me but my my other friend my one of my classmates which is
jordan dia like
dia like mati-mati nak biomedical science jer like he go to common science program solely for that course but the thing is if he works hard for it
but the thing he tak put in effort and expect to get that course which is doesn't make sense lah cause a lot of like biomedical science is a course where it has like a high competition you know a lot of people want to join in because of the jobs they offer and all
biology also tak pernah dapat A
A susah nak dapat then it's mostly like B and C so if you want to go bio biomed also like you have to study really hard lah cause it's the um they focus um on biology the most
so like this semester tak ada exam so I next semester ada exam
still haven't to the point where I want to give up and all still okay pasal assignment dia pun is
tak banyak like is mostly more for lab practices and safety assignment then for the rest is like after you done for the day kan like through read virtually like other then after that um
habis ada quiz juga that you have to do like you have to submit before twelve
then the practice question is like biasa macam homework gitu
mostly banyak presentation but it's good lah
because like prepare you for the future cause confirm um when you enter working life there's a lot of presentation you have to do so I feel like other advantages and disadvantages disadvantages pasal like I think you will feel like
kalau I memorise I think I can say it confidently but somehow if like impromptu kan is just like my weakness like
then pasal presentation the
presentation was okay as times goes by then macam
senang lah but because they will give us like a problem statement and then that problem statement we have to solve it with a powerpoint slide like our answers and all like what we think what is our opinion on on this problem statement and then present it to the class but sometimes when you have like team mates yang
our lunch break is equals to our study break like our presentation punya tu
sometimes I'm like wow kita dah eighteen
like you know when I was in like primary school I always like admire those people with like secondary school near um uniforms so macam eh how is it feels like to be like old like kind of old lah then I was like
now that I'm like at that stage kan aku macam actually it's normal macam biasa like wow it's just normal lah honestly
and it's okay cause macam tak ada boyfriend kan it's okay lah macam we don't really take that into my mind macam oh like die die you
must have a boyfriend must have like someone by your side like keluar dates with you know I think
I don't really mind lah kalau I have a boyfriend or not as long as macam that is like um kawan dekat you know I think
relationship with your friends and family is already good enough for me pasal later so you like have studies and all by the time you're like busy and all your studies like take over your schedule and all so like there's
NAFA is like lah kirakan
like different people also like different lah honestly like um the things that they're prioritising and it's all like semua ada masing-masing lah hanya
cause in the future also if you want to get married and you want to start a family you wouldn't want your family to macam have a lot of worries like oh pasal duit and all that of course you want your family to be macam stable lah like in every um ya in everything you know
it's very hard lah like I feel like kalau family tak cannot like tak tak ada like stability and all that kan I feel like ah one day confirm will fall apart punya
and some more I also like the type of person yang tak message orang
like wow kalau dah malas dia punya malas is malas tak aku boleh like
for one week straight tak berbual-bual siapa-siapa cause like I'm that type of person ah
so macam ya I'm okay with actually single also is not bad
like sometimes also like after I break up kan macam wah like heartbreak this heartbreak gila babi you know like that kind
but then like wah like sekarang I'm like okay with it like I over it I'm like
but even though like there are times macam eh macam nak ada orang like to be by your side like a boyfriend lah okay kirakan like cakap good nights and good mornings all but then still I think
kita boleh get over it lah there's just like moments where we really like want to have that someone that kind you know
so like sometimes kalau oh ada family gathering kan it's nice like to talk about our own life like just joke around about something ah even my sister like
like uh video call her friends during ah apa ni I'm having a dinner so I I feel like macam like in like
you will need to have like some privacy you know it's not like okay lah kalau ada kawan tu okay but then like kalau it's time to like for your family you focus on your family jer tak mahu get mixed lah like video call with friends like
other time you can do what like kat sekolah pun jumpa kawan yang like jumpa kawan habis kat rumah also like kawan then like when are you going to like you know um
mm spend time with your family not really ya tak ada
wow I'm lucky to be in such a family kind punya vibes cause different family different ah ada family like focus um
solely on like spending time with families other families just like heck care you know but I feel like in the future kalau nak ada family I think I would like spent mostly like my time on families then kalau like my anak-anak macam ada boyfriend ke girlfriend ke aku macam nak bagi advice sikit
I got here lah so I mean initially we plan to meet pukul dua belas gitu but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay lah I want to naik basikal then now I'm regretting it lah
hot pun it's not tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah like the past few days it's not really that got lah but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place tak tak jauh sangat it's eleven kilometers
and the weather cuaca pun okay juga lah so I mean it's okay you got lah so I mean it's
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law tapi dia cakap difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling tak payah pakai mask pe
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask yang kena and the one the government kasih atau the one that they government suruh lah
I just use the kain like the one the the they call it the kain untuk muka
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent ah barang-barang kena muka like some debris you just go to uh face what's that at least apa dia ada protection because if not like
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is tempat kosong so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre lah maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to cepat juga lah but then
then some more ada construction tempat construction so
so the tempat construction is just debris ah then the habuk-habuk masuk hidung then I was like my nose a bit itchy lah then I mean
okay ah then ya so that that was the time yang cause that one tempat dekat dengan forest forest sana because it's the ulu ulu tempat ulu sana so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya lah err lalat masuk lah hidung
eh lalat masuk mulut
I mean literally it's not at house anymore lah dia dah dekat luar lah
eh ya dia masuk lah I mean
you are cycling penat-penat jauh it's like you are jauh then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna pakai mulut eh pakai your hidung ya it's kena use your pakai mulut lah you
then by chance the thing masuk and nasib tak masuk my the the air pipes it masuk my esophagus straightaway so I just telan
dia makan betul ah I also tak berak-berak so okay ah
sakit no ah it just
I think it's just extra protein ah I don't know apa dia makan kat that ulu area and I mean forest I mean housefly they flies are basically came from maggots what then then they evolve
so I don't know maybe there's something they rotten there then I'm just extra protein lah abeh some people confirm makan maggot what good
you want nak makan bat
currently I'm taking kat the the ubi sana lah I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing ah like naik basikal if you exercise you go distance and if you work pakai kerja deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also lah like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license lah bike license boleh tolong apa like like two in one so just settle everything
aku pun tak tahu but I I think depends lah I think now the the rate dia dah really drop dah jatuh so
cause I think now there's a influx dah banyak I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now kerja ah apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a ada grabfood dengan foodpanda eh apa deliveroo account ah I don't really need dapat masuk joined foodpanda lah so I think
I those two is enough ah and then now also masih because I'm now masih like recently kena diagnosed dengan hyperthyroidism so my saya I just sakit sangat lah I just susah nak nak exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down ah just do less
I don't remember calling it docket uh I think the maybe dia orang it's a foodpanda punya benda ah pasal for apa grabfood dengan deliveroo they call it ah incentive so dapat incentive like you deliver ten ah
thirty forty dollars that was itu pun only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one kerja lah the orang lain semua kerja kerja so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
competing competing orang-orang lain semua ah so
that is grabfood lah for for deliveroo incentive punya ada every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
like you in a in a pickle you just call jer nanti they just will assist you ah tolong just tolong you like just like that grabfood you call sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat
oh ya ya depends lah kalau dia orang nak kasih tip dia orang nak kasih tip ah I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself tak ada tip culture what it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip nanti dia orang fikir eh ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
ya they give ten dollar I tip just kasih ah
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app atau the cash so they will just give you cash ah like from singapore's tipping
food their tipping like their the the person the company they ambil duit the the that it was supposed to tip but to you so it's like
rabak ah but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip ah so that's what the company the company
well I mean because tak ada duit selalu no pocket no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment pakai dia punya that account lah so ya so my biggest is paling banyak is ten dollar ah lah but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar lah itu dapat terus sepuluh dollar just just the just deliver and it was a tempat pun like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically tempat dia is like depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan then he just like maybe
fifty meter and lima puluh meter jer I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar dia orang kasih then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter pergi angkat itu jer
been a long time ago lah like dah lama juga ah I've gained back the empat ratus tu so
like four empat about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories ah barang like
it's err I mean you want to do something you on the road ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun it's you what
the thing is sometime pun orang like you rider you will sometimes take naik basikal you I mean then you anything happen like then eh guai lan padahal sometimes you forget eh your your means your safety first lah you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you lupa about yourself lah so it's quite stupid ah sometimes like you
we are paid by duit apa by by by time so the time you cepat you get more money so kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu green green light belum green light tu showing but you want nak to go you want to go
ya lah so safety also have to come first ah because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk lah but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian jalan jalan lah so like senang
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I since I can go two in one go to the road and pergi the pedestrian pathway tapi
kadang-kadang pun singapore drivers
memang semacam ah
err talking about check back blind spot tadi on the way here already I was I was really know I was
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on um from the main road going straight so dia dari the the the other side nak masuk the main road from the zebra crossing ah the junction so the
the driver dia tak nampak ah I like I was really prepared to break from jauh but I was already dah macam dah nak
I was really like to be beside her in that main road dia just jam break ah then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like dia not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her ah
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour boleh nampak apa dari jauh then like there was a car like
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't tak ternampak tak nampak so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break ah
so she just she jam break herself ah then just I hear dia cakap sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her lah
oh ya err so sekarang I'm taking my bike license lah like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
I mean it's a good thing for a license lah you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are dari the cyclists ah you are like basically the food chain ah kat bawah sekali
ah tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh
ya like I think then I think the instructor pun cakap you because some people dah dia dah ada three A license of the three class three three license
then they dia orang nak ambil class two B then they then I think they instructor pun cakap ah you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but sekarang nak nak naik motor then now you know orang motor apa yang jadi so just now I was doing practical lah I did revision but then I think what reason siang sangat because
like cepat sangat ah because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
uh prac five is the revision dah I mean it's the internal cost lah but I already cleared that just that I did revision because dah lama tak naik motor
six kat luar
oh you mean keluar from the to the main road ah yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also naik basikal so I can see apa yang or like what's happening ah kata orang too happening sia I also macam takut ah nak nak nak nak keluar that main road just to naik basikal
I because I choose ubi pasal pun like dekat dengan basikal so I think I I mean naik basikal sana okay lah I don't want to naik basikal every time go pevery time go
I mean aku pun don't mind lah kena ride on some something ride on me but
depends lah so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay lah once in a while occasion so like how aku naik naik basikal sini to to here then also I need to go back naik basikal so depends lah but then nak every time nak take lessons no thanks ah
I will just take public but then now pasal nak dekat so I naik basikal to jer lah
dua puluh enam dua puluh enam the practical like depends lah kadang-kadang in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
I mean basikal pun okay for exercise like I mean comes to dapat motor pun okay lah you
like for transportation because now also tengah like belajar pun like easy lah like boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik public abeh public tempat penuh sangat then you cannot sit down terus macam
I don't know lah I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always macam
I I I don't know lah macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik
singapore I rasa lah I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the I mean the buses everything is err I mean reliable just that I don't know why ah
I was I rasa kubur-kubur dan kena you dug up the kubur then underground then hantu dah semua datang
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike kat sana is one sixty
I don't know ah I want to jimat duit pun okay lah but then I want to nak like I mean nak nampak handsome sikit ah so
tak handsome sangat lah
ya like ah muka aku pun buruk sangat so kalau pun tak tak boleh tolong tapi at least kalau at least I from a seven maybe masuk naik atas ke nine ke eight ke all over there ah
you pandai juga eh motor kau
I think when I think kalau nak beli motor pun I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe uh as a second second owner ah not gonna buy until dah nak habis maybe maybe
kalau ada duit of course obviously I will buy ah like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out ah like
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing ah macam like that's because I would be macam jauh away from singapore ya like for enam bulan so I think see how first lah
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing lah ada ada datang balik terus the tyre hilang tinggal handlebar jer kat sana but park kat carpark tinggal handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing lah but
ah I so that's why I need to see first most probably tengok lah most probably I just comeback
then uh I think most probably I will still nak ambil class three three license lah I mean
I mean we err like uh nak buat family cannot be bringing your child kalau ada child naik naik naik motor pe I means still can lah but then like cannot lah like but singapore I mean were asking if want to naik naik bus pe public but then
like when it comes to reliability macam barang-barang selalu breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
aiya I think that one too vague lah like everything can be improve lah semua benda boleh boleh improve pe ada benda merepek pun boleh improve
so tengok lah like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much ah nanti benda problem nanti then you are relying that thing benda rosak then you are
so pandai-pandai ah so that one also cannot rely too much lah
oh ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn ah berbual for I mean this conversation we are having so
which um the surprise yang paling besar yang orang like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
oh so like ah okay okay so duduk lama-lama then suddenly you just don't know either dia orang datang so they put your car then what happen next
so we basically dah kereta you just waiting waiting then dia orang dah sampai tempat pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park lah so then after that dia orang nak bawa to the place to eat lah so and so tempat makan dia at where exactly
okay now let's understand so siapa like you who siapa who was there like siapa kat sana semua like is it your all your soccer mates ah is it just them or ada orang lain celebrating
okay lah I mean ya I mean the also quite gerek lah but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday ah orang like you are with lah people you love orang kalau kawan help your family depends like everyone like ada orang macam nak celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves tak nak orang involved
everybody orang celebrate differently ah so I think it's good lah like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want ah ada some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite dia padahal dia tak nak celebrate they are just nak lepak kat rumah
nak tidur tu jer so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want ah
just kasih duit jer I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff ah I think like ah you give me duit I I can spend myself you give me a voucher kat also I happy dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah
so I think that will be is enough untuk like for me lah tapi
I mean it's good lah you like your friends chip in everything for barang-barang for you
right your your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting lah like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are eh apa like what is happening and like
tengah buat apa ni what they doing sia you are dalam dalam hati is just takut tapi it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say ah duit vouchers are a good thing ah like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just orang just acquaintances you just tanya the mutual friend like eh apa dia suka ah like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to apa
pergi shopping rather you maybe buy a like get err voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also tak shopping banyak sangat
and ya I think the typical barang for guy is orang kasih apa eh kasih those perfume I guess the the they demo apa lagi uh they don't call it perfume dia orang panggil apa eh oh cologne ah cologne but I mean
I don't know lah jangan nak nak step atas cakap perfume sudah lah for me lah okay but
err tapi ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch lah like senang ah unless orang dia macam those uh yang benda benda the all the watches dia dah dah dah ada rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course lah tak payah fikir pasal tu
even grand but then orang orang orang siapa seh ni aku tak berbual then terus it's like
it's like err it's like eh ah like awkward lah you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand lah so so orang kalau fikir okay invite orang lebih lebih padahal you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself tak payah tak payah no need to hide your personality gitu
okay that is I mean birthdays lah but then it's like I mean to me you fikir fikir birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like apa that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person lah dah dah dah tua dah lama or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
okay whatever you said that one orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat like you I mean like birthday birthday ah
tak payah nak mm susah sangat like what you said kalau orang nak book tempat pun as a as an example kalau the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december orang orang confirm like it's gonna be fully book lah so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya lah there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday nak barang-barang semua yang bagus ah like I mean for a celebration lah it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays ah once in a lifetime ah you can you are gonna be that age for once only uh unless err I don't know percaya reincarnation that one different topic lah
okay uh uh ya I guess that's susah ah tapi I think dah nak they by their by their age
jauh lah like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december ah then you have to book very early but then
banyak banyak hotel pun nak book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard lah pasal you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating ah
okay lah ya I mean ya lah I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya lah COVID sekarang buat everything susah even
not even just nak keluar holiday like nak keluar untuk kerja overseas is like the deployment kat overseas is orang semua susah susah is like now everybody kena in singapore like thinking
like they're like whether this apa apa this career dia orang tengah buat is on hold pasal of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point lah not just birthdays ah so like all other like holidays or even like work ah kerja kerja critical this is a it's like a
a good err thing that is I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened lah so like orang can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect ah like in the future is this ah like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead jauh jauh lain ah
I mean the furthest I went paling jauh is U like the I went to that was bila kecil-kecil ah los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember apa yang I did
I mean it helps lah you you got you like you already plan lah nak pergi okay okay I want aku nak pergi jepun so I want to like at least belajar a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
taberu makan like like all those ah keyword like taberu makan and ah coco desuka like ni nak pergi err like go where nak pergi mana go where some something like that lah so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard lah nak cari makan makanan halal but then
I mean yang the big staple food there is you can just I mean minta so I guess ikan sushi nasi and one
I mean hokkaido no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only yokohama that eh no oh no tokyo is lagi tinggi dari yokohama so no that's the highest I've been is to tokyo so but
I think hokkaido tempat tempatnya ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff ah benda-benda cream is usually benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk I mean that that that latitude tinggi-tinggi pun memang understandable lah so ya I mean hokkaido is when it comes to makanan tempat benda sejuk lah dessert
I think it's not also just that lah I mean you also tempat
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also dia orang pun cantik juga I mean their complexion is there tempat pasal there tempat sejuk if it's cold then you don't really sweat much tempat so it depends ah
I mean that's understandable lah you see orang-orang yang mat salleh orang those memang the further north
but the percentage point tak tinggi sangat lah so it's ya lah I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends ah
honestly I think it's a waste of money orang like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just takut eh orang also pergi then I never pergi it's like I cannot talk about it sial berbual abeh then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that dia orang dah pergi so that can talk
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot untuk nak anuh dah just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite merepek ah orang nak belanja then up to them
the other day was just the other day was first time first time aku turun rumah dia then after that aku try kan ah baju dia I mean dia tak pernah nampak cause COVID pe
she was satisfied with it lah which I'm I'm relief lah cause I scared macam
for baju nikah right
apa tu what is what did they call that ah
takde glow that's what I meant takde glow
baju dia right is baju lama

that baju already on the rack since
material the bajunya material is bridal setting right
yang baju dalam baju dalam dia is a dress

kat mana seh
dia macam boot

but dia nya location for the gym is only one place ah area
mid september I so I go home naik taxi right
and then some more my our pay is seventh of the month right so aku submit
aku submit like
and then she say it will be in ah for november pay eh ah october pay lah but I will receive in november apa
so dia pun
peng ah because dia tanya macam how much you got paid ah then after that ah he said oh
dia she just with what just graduated from poly
cause she did events management so in term of macam layan customer and all she's quite good lah like when she draft email actually not bad like no problem in terms of grammar
kesian kan entah macam bila dia datang kerja right sekarang dia datang kerja dia tak dia tak ada semangat ya demoralised I mean
wasted the cert macam tak ada guna
ah suruh dia berbual ah dengan manager cause confirm ada macam review apa dia dah habis dia nya tiga bulan
so macam sometime manager aku tanya macam okay everything okay everything okay
so kalau aku cakap dengan dia ah kalau it bothers her so much
that one point nine is just kau punya
kan aku actually kasi dia scenarios sia like some ya you try lah you try talk like that
kita kalau nak berbual kita tak boleh macam ah cakap pasal macam asal kita tak happy
yes cannot macam involve other people and knowing that they what what's their pay like because surely there is already breach of contract pe and the agreement
dia setakat hire jer
and then she said macam
dia takut ah kalau dia berbual gini
dengan manager aku ke dengan atau dia berbual dengan ke apa or maybe the boss confirm after this dia kena macam pulau
confirm kena pulau kan yes macam eh dia ni budak yang minta minta higher pay
so it's kesian ah
is not conducive at all lah I I I when I see them doing email macam annoying
yes so can you imagine you are doing email abeh you you see customer coming right
but this is not the case that's why when I see her macam one point nine is not enough sia
macam it's like a chain effect
the big bosses anuh
the another boss boss boss then after that go to manager then manager kena manager will go to us kena
second last day of january then why not then I kira kan unemployed after that ya
macam work with him lah is not work with him

that's why I aku macam shock huh I get express shipping thank you lah
yes and is like cost you a bomb but I did my research what so I actually read up review whoever who bought the same brand uh of roller skates then I see macam okay most of them actually it said that is fit to your true size so you don't have to worry about sizing up or sizing down

as for me aku ada bake ah I still got bake at home with my nenek
tapi aku punya adik like don't really bake abeh tiba-tiba you want to start then you start with the hardest thing you can think of aku ingat siapa punya birthday eh aku punya maknya birthday eh

dekat mana eh dekat rumah chloe eh
alah dorang dua neighbour
aku pergi sana end up aku masak mac and cheese
abeh dorang tiga tengah sibuk dengan dorang punya coffee
susah kan
tak tahu cukup bro
like I didn't cook a lot macam I cook a bit just for myself just to see apa ni
whether it's good or not lah like the combination tapi macam all four macam not that
berapa banyak then the low heat
tapi yang actually susah singapore mac and cheese is the type of cheese
the slice punya ah abeh the third one I went to
aku tak ingat ah aku beli Cold Storage kat kedai tu ah yang Cold Storage yang Fairprice Finest tu
dia ada aku beli jer ah
confirm I cannot remember nya
korang masak like during is like not really
masakan melayu kind
so that time I tried my nenek then I just ask
what was it ah some sambal
can't remember I think was like ayam masak merah
then end up the only thing yang aku ingat kan is like there already aku masak tom yum nasi goreng tom yum seh
like korang korang masak is like
like ikut measurement berapa sudu all those kind of thing
then when my nenek masak then she ajar right then she just like oh ambil sikit ambil sikit ni ni ambil lagi banyak abeh ni lagi sikit then I macam stress sia I don't even remember what is sikit what is banyak
that's why part ramadhan susah nak masak
so end up macam nak masak sayur pun depends on the age of the sayur that kind of hing
Gegar Vaganza is the one show that all the orang tua tengok
I don't know lah my datuk nenek always watching lah
but is not macam it's not macam Singapore Idol like they get new people then they is like talent is more of like already existing
ya like bring back the last time lah like hady mirza menang pe Gegar Vaganza that time
I never show you meh yang hady mirza nya
uh cinta luar biasa
okay later I show you then quite funny I saw dia nya starting that was his like second or third episode
then like he was saying he went back to Gegar Vaganza pasal like
that's why end up before that also dia buat macam
belum lagi early bro
then I will wait there duduk depan then dengan phone is like mana akid I just press record
ah dia nya kakaknya wedding ah
tak ada lah
cause dia nya cake was from my shop
aku ambil dia nya cake then I took Grab then I go there to her house ah
I think initially dorang buat they were looking at hotel tu semua
went on with it ah kat rumah but okay ah
okay lah but I never actually ask how much they spend that time aku punya kawan pun kahwin
then I think dia nya masak pun is dorang masak sendiri
dorang tak order cater tak I don't think is cater that wasn't cater pasal tak banyak orang datang
like they didn't invite a lot lah but then it's kat Zoom
then they like she invite kawan pun like secondary school just me and another person
then she invite like two of her poly friends dah tu jer then her bridesmaids lah
so it's like even as the bride herself dia tak invite banyak orang
okay ah but now banyak dorang
as in the company dorang buat is like cater hantar rumah pe
like the thing like that like that that time that mariam punya mak
um wow that sounds great aku past few days aku tak buat apa-apa yang menarik sangat aku cuma duduk dekat rumah jer tengok
janganlah kita buang duit nak beli handphone yang mahal-mahal tapi tak ada lah beza sangat dengan handphone yang lama kan
mostly kalau aku boleh mimpi lah satu hari healthcare percuma lah untuk semua orang
susah kan dia orang nak afford untuk bayar dia orang punya hospital bills kan
nenek saya pun masuk hospital pun dah beberapa dah beberapa kali pasal sakit pasal jatuh
pun tak murah lah kan nak bayar dia punya itu
um obviously as of right now I don't think it's possible for anybody to be invisible so you know who knows maybe one day in the future kita boleh hilangkan diri eh in a way that
kalau aku pun aku memang nak lah sebab macam dia kata kalau during exams kalau lah masa O level aku boleh baca minda orang eh yang duduk depan aku itu budak pandai itu kalau aku boleh baca minda dia mana tahu aku punya results lagi bagus daripada sekarang ke
ya betul-betul boleh baca minda kawan lah kalau dia tengah tipu ke kalau dia tengah jujur ke tak tahu lah kalau orang ini berbual merepek ke you know I mean I guess mind reading is I'd say is pretty powerful to be honest but who knows maybe someday
yang pertama if kalau boleh aku nak
dapat cepat-cepat belajar apa-apa bahasa dalam dunia lah sebab pertama sekali um daripada kecil dulu pergi kelas madrasah selalu dapat dan sudah dapat belajar bahasa arab tapi sampai sekarang pun masih tak boleh err nak cakap satu ayat pun dalam bahasa arab sebab berapa susah nak belajar
so kalau ada peluang bahasa arab
bahasa german dengan italian
aku kalau boleh lah kalau dapat lah nak cuba
um master lah dengan beberapa cepat lah yang kedua kalau boleh saya nak
um belajar masak dengan betul-betul baik
macam faidil kata tadi dia boleh look up to orang macam gordon ramsay yang memang hebat sekali bila masak tapi kalau saya saya tak
ikut lah gordon ramsay kalau boleh pun saya nak ikut emak saya sahaja sebab dia memang satu inspirasi bagi saya dan
kalau saya dah ada berumahtangga kalau ada bini ke saya tak nak bini saya tanggung semua tanggungjawab untuk masak untuk kita dan anak-anak kita so
mana tahu dua tiga minggu sekali saya boleh nak memasak untuk anak kita dan iya lah dapat senangkan untuk semua orang
movie romantic ini memang aku suka lah sebab aku ini suka nangis abeh tengok cerita-cerita macam gini I mean iya lah kalau kalau aku nangis kan memang dapat rasa emosi dia lah bila tengok orang berlakon
tapi macam drama-drama melayu pun banyak dekat tiga ke malaysia astro ke dapat tengok
kebanyakkan cerita romantis kelakar lah tapi
memang aku suka lah
dengan um iya lah I mean other than romance I'd say I mean comedy would be my go to ah
kalau aku ada time capsule being the very nostalgic person I am
jadi aku boleh iya lah kalau sekarang buka aku boleh tengok lah gambar-gambar tersebut kan
and iya lah fikir lah masa sebab dulu masa kita sepuluh sembilan sepuluh tahun tak banyak stress kan dalam hidup
kalau nak bandingkan dengan sekarang tak banyak risau tak tahu apa-apa about the world we don't know how bad the world is nowadays you know just think of yourself a more carefree time
whoa memang menarik itu jawapan dia
I mean duit itu memang penting lah kalau aku aku pun nak duit lah seratus billion dollars itu memang
tak tahu lah nak buat apa eh dah terlalu banyak sangat dah duit dia
um dalam keadaan dunia ini sekarang
aku akan wish untuk semua orang
dengan stable ah sebab sekarang ini banyak orang hidup susah
dunia ini pun semakin um semakin mahal untuk tinggal dalam susah untuk keluarga untuk survive kan
so yang pertama I would wish for poverty to end cause
I mean ya um liverpool is a good club I I would like to argue with that but aku rasa chelsea itu memang aku dah lama lah sokong so aku aku tak akan tukar minda aku
aku memang aku memang jealous lah yang liverpool menang title tahun lepas
tapi aku aku rasa kalau aku control chelsea sendiri aku janji tiap-tiap tahun kita akan menang itu aku pastikan so iya lah kalau aku dah sokong itu memang aku tak akan tukar lah eh
kegemaran lah yang
eh nasi pula lauk lemak
and aku and I really like it and I do not know how to make it so
kalau kalau boleh I want to become a journalist cause
iya lah betul lah memang
betul betul betul betul judgemental kan sekarang
so kalau aku boleh pilih
kalau jujur cakap aku nak pilih badan yang sihat lah
daripada muka yang handsome lah
aku akan pilih badan yang lebih sihat lah sebab lebih susah untuk nak turunkan berat badan daripada
lebih baik lah untuk orang lain kan
kalau orang itu badan dia memang bagus ke muka dia betul-betul handsome ke
apa that personality is in someone is more important right like for us as a guy
um I just why aku rasa hidup dekat singapura ini sebagai seorang remaja memang
memang laju lah untuk senang kata lah memang laju memang banyak stress banyak yang nak buat
dan ini baru sebelum orang masuk kerja ini belum lagi masuk kerja akan dapat lebih stress
culture di pada negara-negara di asia lah sebab iya lah benda macam um kesihatan mental ini memang
bagi keluarga melayu ke dekat asia ini memang tak diambil berat lah
untuk ibu bapa kan sebab cara mereka dengan cara kita kan tak sama mereka datang daripada zaman yang mungkin lebih susah lah jadi mungkin mereka tak anggapkan kesihatan mental sebagai sesuatu yang penting lah
you wish you could have helped to avoid it but tak boleh so
yang one way or another has been at fault
um when I think about the past twenty years living in singapore I'm very I'm very thankful and memang bersyukurlah dapat pergi sekolah belajar daripada kindergarten sampai sekarang dekat sekolah poly ambil diploma
um dapat buat dengan senang tak ada tak ada bill yang mahal-mahal yang kita kena bayar macam orang yang datang dari luar negara um dekat sini pun um healthcare macam dekat polyclinic ke dekat hospital pun
kita punya apa dia kita punya government kita dapat tolong dapat cover kan dapat bantu and ada um as someone who has two siblings with special needs

then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
Greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan I don't know how they record
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then err
but what if they start recording okay tak apa ah then that means the movie wouldn't be out what
I mean pernah lah macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel kan
then macam oh disney channel then got mulan then tengok ah then like oh whatever
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa kan okay at first she's a guy eh she's a woman
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
she she sakit then she baring I think sick or whatever I don't know
orang tengah berbual pasal mulan
oh so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the in that government even though kau sakit ke apa eh sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the mulan dia macam kasihan kan that's why she left that note
oh what to curi
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
I think bukan renovation it's just macam err
ya there's no one tapi that time eh that time I went is before corona is it
cause they I think pasal dia orang dah tukar eh
yang wave wave pool the big one
dia macam very mundane the wave not really like power
no longkang longkang yang jalan sendiri lazy pool
ah longkang longkang
and the actual olympic punya swimming
you you try move your apa ni paket you taruh depan you
pasal kalau you tengok you punya sound wave kan dia macam when you kill let's say
grey tuan
oh cause my one dia gerak banyak seh maybe because my voice is loud ah
okay okay you see ah my my wave besar tahu
I I jauh begini pun boleh dengar
there was this one girl yang
I was with macam sama sekolah
so kita just grow like from nursery K one eh
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever kan sampai P six
then my adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas
so then dia orang macam kacau kacau my adik kan adik dia lah
kalau they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume yang kau orang ada benda
ya so begitu jer lah tapi
it was just like macam
a topic in macam mak bapa berbual
bila primary six
kan then I tak tahu kenapa ah
then macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa
ya allah eh wait eh belum habis eh jap
ya so macam uh apa ni
suka nak jumpa that kind of thing
macam cute kan P six
eh eh eh eh dia ni
ni what do you mean by you like the person you like err you eh
I thought eh sia ah dini gerek sia kalau dengan dia pun best
but I think I think my one is amplified eh like berbual
tak pasal I berbual biasa tahu this is considered normal to me tahu but then it's like
you know there's in a group there's that one that takes charge macam let's say kalau you nak keluar
there's that one guy okay lah kita gini ah then everyone macam okay ah go ah no problem macam yes
actually when the robot tu dengar gemuk
then the robot dengan dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk
so ya there's leader ni
actually just just two people tahu
so macam let's say okay
so everywhere they go kan ah okay lah jom ah like then okay lah pergi makan ah okay lah jom ah jom ah main bola ah
okay okay lah go ah that kind of ya so macam primary school what I did was
P one P two begitu

cause I I had to call I had to talk to my father first what before I give my phone so I cakap uh assalamualaikum ya
I at work eh ah ni my teacher want to talk ah I I laugh in class then then err
apa lagi lah janaz okay okay okay
then kita berbual berbual berbual berbual lah then after that
bual bual bual bual bual bual kan
then dah berbual then my my dad want to talk to me again so my the mister tan give back the phone
then I laugh back lah he was like ha ha kenapa lah buat joke macam gitu
ni merepek jer something like that then I macam tak tahu I I then I was just laughing ah then the mister tan was just looking at me eh weirdly tahu
so I I think in his head lah pasal apa seh dia ni tengah apa tengah ketawa
dia cakap okay okay okay nevermind ah you just you you don't you don't so loud ah you just pay attention in class ah then I was like okay okay okay then hang up
then I masuk class kan semua tanya ah I remember seh
tengok eh what did you do
ya that's why macam tak kena
eh amacam
oh so you just came back from batam ah err amacam batam okay tak sekarang how is the the situation there
aku pun dah lama pun tak pergi batam
terpingin ah
dah lama sia tak pergi batam betul
COVID dah datang apa dah datang semua tak boleh pergi travel pun tak boleh itu pun tak boleh but a lot of people affected right
our friend there all err yang dekat batam semua some of the guides tour guide and then those
pakcik-pakcik yang bawa van ni semua amacam dia orang ah you still keep in touch with err all of them
you mean parking parking as in what macam jaga parking ke apa
kat barelang kan jauh but farming barelang I don't know but can do farming in indonesia what what what
dia tanam apa ah
ah err tanam papaya
and then those err macam seasonal like jagung now I think most of them is planting jagung lah or corn
uh jual pasar
massage mall shop is quiet very quiet takde orang
err because I think dulu dia orang harapkan apa
parlour over there err dah tutup
takde business
then dekat mana shopping mall err I would say
mall the mall is empty tak ramai orang
err like even on the street dekat dekat tengah jalan kat jalan tu kat nagoya tu is very quiet
I left on twenty nine october turun turun jakarta
jumpa kat jakarta then sama-sama balik err
balik balik batam
ah because nak jumpa
so they came from from from dia orang datang dari kampung
ah so jumpa dulu one or two ah one night then proceed lah
then before that you fill up so when you beli when you beli when you buy the ticket at the counter they would want to see this email
sampai kat singapore
I see is bila you dah after in front of the immigration tu there will be cisco officers lah so ah the the immigration will just go signal to them that say okay this one is like that lah
then from there I don't know macam you just wait dekat waiting area then all the all of you all of us will leave in one bus lah
but probably communicate they mention about communication wise is through err macam for me also I don't tak tahu pun where I'm going to
err they did inform ikut jer
I think but I think I think kalau kita tanya they will answer lah but then they didn't I think they are busy sorting out all the all the going here going there kan so that time communication wise I think ya
err nazi semua when you think of nazi is
not not until like that apa is all systematic what singapore
uh uh melebih melebih ah cara-cara the way they discuss sampai ah tu melebih lah kan jadi sama jer macam kita bantu tak tahu kita ikut jer pe
for me is fine but I got I got I don't know the the hotel that I'm in is a whole window so macam
I think they it helps lah dengan apa tu dengan kalau cermin is a small window cermin apa window kecil gitu I will akan rasa stress lah but but because it's a big window
so you know dapat tengok luar
tak stressful lah tu you got a lot of pass time kira kereta berapa ah that is what I do lah in the morning during err peak hours
err randomly kira-kira kereta jalan berapa banyak
macam you know alah you you you you you you are you are when you leave the country you should be prepared that you will be getting through this which is good enough that you get a good hotel a decent hotel apa
ah berpada ah you know some country another negeri dapat tempat is really really bad
for me is just alhamdulillah lah you know dapat makan you get a good hotel then after that a good bed for two weeks
I mean it's your it's choice lah how macam mana kita nak nak tu kan how how you nak nak how you want to make use of
what you have apa yang kita ada tu ah ya lah like I have for me iya lah tu lah kita duduk duduk tu kira appreciate but for me is that I got that room I I got that whole window I appreciate that very much lah
ah tak tak tak terasa terkongkong tu jer
ah sekarang jadi malas ah dah dua minggu makan tidur makan tidur sleep err
do my deliveroo lah but to do work lah so during weekend weekend nak kena kerja weekend we have to work
I work I work eh dua shift dua shift err either start at eight
err eleven so macam eight they cover breakfast kalau err
cover lunch lunch err eleven have to start all the way already lah all the way until petang ah until evening
alhamdulillah lah really really for me is that alhamdulillah macam you know you control for me is that you control how much you want to earn
you you you you know how much are you you know how much you can earn macam berapa banyak kita boleh apa kita boleh earn ah so if you you need that money if you need more you work have to work a bit hard lah
nanti nak kena fikir thinking macam mana
how is it gonna be a new year tahun ni eh
pukul satu pagi semua kat block agaknya
I believe uh macam neighbourhood ada dia punya apa tu bunga api sikit eh sikit-sikit sikit-sikit okay lah like that
singapore yang the officially close the border
macam the hundred dollars you can only take a bit a bit a bit sikit-sikit kan
tu lah that's why I'm thinking mana nak pergi
macam aduh
next year boleh after new year
apa sea aquarium uh belum pergi uh
adventure cove tak buka kan ah ah belum buka lagi ah aku tunggu juga
jap pergi supper dok just but
I think macam eh kita ni macam singaporean kan lucky lah macam beruntung
appreciate macam you should appreciate apa kita apa ni
apa yang kita dapat apa-apa what our government give us ah yes yes yes
macam how to say ah macam
dulu macam kita for last time when we are here abeh kita tengok macam tengok this year how come you know  mak dia orang ni everyday dia punya cases naik macam tak jaga kan ah but when when you are there then you realise lah err that sometimes you know it's not that they don't macam dia orang tak nak
tapi looking at their economy
and with azan lain macam dia orang kan kebanyakkannya
gaji hari then kalau kena quarantine empat belas hari
ah betul itu lah itu dia orang tu nak quarantine susah macam kalau dia orang empat belas hari siapa nak kasih makan keluarga
ah tu macam tu lah kadang-kadang bukan dua orang tak nak kan but then
negara tu kan
nak nak quarantine lah that kind of stuff
oh macam sometimes the government ada kasih until when the amount to reach them it's it's not the original amount lah
ah along along along along the way itu
ada potong potong potong itu lah situasi sebetulnya
kurang uh uh
then also masa err some of them
no they don't dia orang tak nak pergi hospital sebab
kita too negative
apparently for every untuk setiap orang yang mereka hantar to pergi refer the hospital get money
not under table is government government bayar so hospital tu hospital tu will just say you're positive
ah ah satu
I just don't know that's why for untuk orang local ini nak pergi hospital
ah and if you speak to most of them semua semua gitu ah because initially I thought this is full macam tak this is bullshit right sekali but then berbual dengan orang sana berbual lepas tu orang-orang A orang B orang C kan
they give semua jawapan semua sama dia orang takut nak pergi hospital hospital dapat duit
no they no no they they check they check lah no they check they they pergi swab test tapi came back is positive lah
but bila bila kat sana ambil dah negative
for them janji aku dapat duit sudah
uh uh takut semua orang takut
tu lah kan
kesian but kesian orang-orang yang malaysia kan
ah tu macam you saw pasal saiful punya video tu
yang sebelah causeway ah just the causeway tu
setulang dekat ah tu ah R&F dia dekat woodland woodland checkpoint tepi tu
I I think I think dia nikah kat johor
huh I think singapore I mean kat johor yang dia married
officially tu dekat johor tak johor johor mm mm
sorry dia balik
under spouse kat johor malaysia
leave dengan no pay leave lah everything for two months in malaysia ah
eh duit balik tu lagi mahal tau
uh empat ribu enam ratus I was talking to him I was I was talking to him I say
even for malaysian malaysian pun dia orang nak kena bayar I think two thousand plus eh
ya malaysia ni dia orang dia orang how to say eh kalau step step step apa macam like they are strict lah ah tempatnya I don't know ah but I think if talking about strictness lah I think malaysia lebih strict than singapore for in terms of their immigration tinggi
tapi tu lah dia orang
kat yang dalam locally tu lah
that's why told him lah you know it depends have to bayar but then
is good investment then it's worth lah you know macam your
ah duit boleh apa ah duit boleh cari but then the moment you have to treasure because
was thinking of the best if I tak if I didn't go back
maybe nak tunggu dia buka maybe two zero two two right two years
okay lah for me is for myself personally is well macam
break lah one and a half month tak kerja ni sampai sekarang dah one week pun nak kerja malas body aching betul sia body aching
tengah hari balik kan tidur aku punya kaki sampai from top to bottom
ache semua sakit kaki
no lah I walk I walk in the room lah five five ten five to ten minutes one end to one end walk that's my exercise first week play game makan sikit ah second week habis
makan wake up ten o'clock breakfast is ready kan makan breakfast
twelve o'clock lunch will come I will but I will I mean keep the food ah pukul dua baru makan tidur tidur sampai pukul lima lebih bangun jer pukul enam
dinner dah sampai
makan dinner pukul lapan

pagi bangun lagi the last two weeks last one week the cycle is like that
my toklang tu I got one page lah it's uh batam concierge
when the border reopens err ada plan ah this transportation
macam-macam I can provide lah because okay I was I'm inspired by my neighbour
dia hari-hari before this COVID kat rumah jer main dengan anak pakai seluar pendek lepak you know
then I was talking to him but the last one month tu
ah every night kita berbual then he did he he inspire he is very inspiring lah
so he made so he told me you know abang abang pernah nampak saya kerja tak memang tak pernah saya hari-hari kat rumah lepak

uh and and and he you know he looking at him starting from nothing tiba-tiba ada kereta ada ada bus uh uh is all made is all from from from from travel lah

uh then even apa tau
you can only extra biasa lah upselling ah kan you pay extra
you get express lane so when you come ada orang dengan your name masuk dalam tak payah queue
ah so like I was like bang try takpe bang abang tak payah buat apa-apa abang
I was thinking eh macam boleh belajar dengan dia lah kan how he how how how he did lah
oh masuk
when you tengok eh it's a it's a niche lah a'ah exactly exactly
someone dah tahu kan
exactly people get the idea right orang akan ikut because I believe also there's a lot of macam err local singaporean guy who got married to
berani cuba you know
all these different kind of food ah kan ah dah berani tau so as as as long you make it halal I mean is halal then orang akan dia orang orang melayu akan try tak macam dulu orang melayu takut nak makan ah sekarang

eh dah lama tak jumpa
yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs lah flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right  abih kena cari kerja sendiri lah
 asal boring what you doing at home
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year  tak sabar rasanya
stress kan  kena buat ni semua but I'm glad  macam its all over already lah now dah holiday  boleh enjoy
 apa was the assignment about duh
 apa itu I tak faham
err so far only  satu je lah like one module err we learn about airport management it's quite interesting lah cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
oh my dream job is to be stewardess lah like cause  macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to penang then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there  macam I work hard lah to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
yeah that was one of my dreams  tapi macam susah lah  nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first lah I see lah if
I want to work at singapore airlines lah but  banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk ah because high standard  semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
oh sekarang ni I I tengah tengok drama korea ah korea ah cerita lama lah cerita legend of the blue sea
just now I eat ah  nasi with  kari daging
wah  sedap nya
 boleh jugak your mom  masak semua
 macam hari raya pulak
yeah but then like my other friends they  banyak kena campak dekat err company  yang tak related to aviation  macam logistics then like some of them will be like under administration or marketing that kind of job
 belum susah cause  aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc kind of job kan  tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard lah I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the changi airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
yeah because because like I said lah like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya lah a bit  takut ah when if you talk then you will talk alone
good lah was it a  macam manageable or stressful
 abih kau macam mana macam ada plans  nak buat business eh
tak they see eh I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers lah
just like the other cafes  semua those that sell the mains all yeah
 sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere ulu somewhere err a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the ulu places right then people want to
and cannot be ulu lah like I said
 sekarang
you mean like malay food  ke
 tauhu bergedil lah I I love that  tauhu bergedil then what else ah bubble tea the what ah oh that time I saw err dalgona bubble tea or something
yeah mostly all at bugis east area like you said lah in the west also not much  halal options cause very boring lah east is the best lah because they have a lot of good food there
a'ah  kalau kereta senang boleh pergi mana mana jer  jauh jauh pon takpe because very convenient
 selalu pergi lah  kadang kadang malam malam ikut err  abah aku pergi isi minyak isi minyak kereta err  pastu kita orang gi makan burger or we go McDonald's right then eat their burger is so nice duh I like their McDonald's menu
yeah but Ramly  dari sana but then I don't like because err  banyak sayur
oh I I've eaten before um  apa tu
it it is okay leh not is like it is a bit like err  ayam and  daging ah
I mean  daging beef a bit a bit like that it just a bit  keras
there's also err burger  arnab
I don't know why I was daring to try that deer meat lah you know cause like I'm there already so  mak I say just try something new because I like to explore what I like to try new food
then that stall also they got sell the  ais kacang
 senang ah  nak cari makanan halal untuk kita
ah I miss also I want to go the  tapak food truck
yeah like the food range for maybe seven  ringgit onwards
that time I bought the buttermilk chicken rice it's ten  ringgit
talking about  nasi lemak I remember that time I went
 abih err  kita orang makan  nasi lemak  dengan lauk lauk lauk pauk you know  nasi lemak then I I  taruk err  ayam of course  ayam ah  ayam goreng
then  taruk like some other  lauk ah like the  sambal telur you know  sambal kerang wah it's really nice
 halal food options so it's so easy for us to find  halal food so like at our hotel right err just across the street there's already like two to three  halal restaurants then as you go down the street there is more option for you lah
 tak I  pergi jogjakarta
 mertabak manis
 sedap gila seh I  suka gila
I've been getting a lot of comments  macam bapak aku dengan pak cik aku cakap eh dah dah dah  apa eh
uh huh dah  tembam
confirm boring lah your house  takde pape nak buat kan  takde three lah  takde
but then we just ignore it then we set up our picnic mat and all lah then  sekali like a few minute after that we can see like on the right side the clouds are very dark and
 sedap it just fruits lah for nothing less berries blueberries that kind of berries
no this is five dah lama
 tapi cause we are too small and mostly is
bila ah staycation
this one you planning to do for kak ain's birthday right
makan kat mana for dinner
central area lagi kalau nak makan
boleh masak Maggi
I think you all can go jalan-jalan dekat gardens by the bay before that
usually like who want to bangun pagi I cannot bangun pagi man
eh kalau staycation
have you been to the yang itu the art museum
because they have that interacting punya
I forgot the time she I think the one that mama went with kak ain dekat
japan kat tokyo they went to the japan one
then mama cakap ada
like this one this macam interacting nya board gitu so you can draw your own animals
oh then she excited macam budak kecil
since dah macam central central
and then your parents boleh
feeling sikit
because I think dekat Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
actually tengok-tengok date lah but then if you book december right you can use your voucher mah
is do you think aryan is old enough to masuk
mm then can boleh pakai seh
but you went to Malayan Council before right to makan
makan dekat sana ada that Noosh Noodle Bar
ah if you go the if you go the the art museum kan dah dekat like you walk through the helix bridge lepas tu dah belok
then dah sampai esplanade what esplanade kan][dah dekat
and nak kalau nak mengopi ada coffee bean
and then boleh jalan-jalan can take photos
yang dekat omotesando
like you know the japanese they very macam
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it dia dah toast panas-panas
then lepas tu the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
ya I feel like semua orang cakap it's um expensive lagi mahal but then I feel like if you record eh uh record pula if you um
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one dekat japan because dekat japan they have the regular size and size
dekat sini they only have size
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people nya mindset macam
ni lagi mahal seh
ah berbual for what
kat japan boleh makan pe but now you're not going japan right so
because I see dekat macam online blog gitu I feel like it's
okay lah dia macam tak lokek
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one yang tanya what is yakiniku
dekat the place itself
so they give you raw beef dia macam Seoul Garden Seoul Garden tapi it's just beef
I had the one dekat japan also it was so good the halal one
so we went and then we went for um during lunch time dia macam tak crowded even though there's so many people at the
and then they had dish macam dish eh
they had this macam
um raw beef set like the bento tapi with raw beef
then the griller dekat depan
so you get to grill your own tapi it's like a bento
dish is like lauk right
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the roti
but it's a dish mah so I thought it's um macam should be included
okay I think I will choose um clam vongole mama punya clam vongole
with lots of cili padi and um
confirm rumah dia besar eh
like have you seen um will smith punya rumah
it's like tingkat bertingkat and then kat belakang ada swimming pool
uh apa tu
will smith punya rumah punya gambar
dorang jalan jauh-jauh pun they will stay around their house
ada macam living room a'ah
dia just kekal
you can be tak handsome but then have a good uh fit body tapi I'm like
once you have a fit body kalau muka tak handsome then I'm like
like you see some model pun macam
eh badan dia buff seh sekali dia pusing ah kau
genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
my favourite channel is the crime investigation channel dekat rumah
tapi sekarang dah tak ada seh
uh like for example conjuring dengan annabelle
because dia macam okay they want to act
make it macam as if oh betul betul happening betul betul like
abeh macam if you macam fikir balik like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven gitu
I mean it's a good macam
maybe dulu is a good macam good thing for a change lah
don't know I like the way she tells the story macam very interesting like she doesn't macam she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't macam
macam tak boring gitu
you know some people nanti dorang macam berbual berbual
and then halfway it gets boring because macam too draggy
tapi and then this
ya I I finished all the ones dekat Facebook
dekat YouTube is still ongoing
there's this one movie dekat Netflix
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix macam a few years ago I thought dia baru keluar
because dulu when
dia keluar bila two thousand eight kan eh two thousand eighteen
the movie keluar
why recently Netflix macam dorang released so many macam documentaries
tomorrow kerja petang seh I think malam that malam after since tutup I think I can watch
macam dah lama nak lah like you wish
so dari kecil sampai sekarang you like
rumah besar as in like
so like balas jasa gitu
tapi dulu when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school kot lupa
ya then dia tak serabak now lah like
tapi COVID is like
from one country then lepas tu another country then lepas tu tiba-tiba like the whole world sampai
airports semua tutup sia like
like tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this macam seriously
tu ah
I mean tapi sekarang re-election so I feel like
tapi macam tu lah I mean korang nak the COVID to finish
to end to finally like macam
no more new cases tu semua everybody to heal
until tak nak dengar like to wear mask wash your hands
tapi orang tak nak dengar then like
esok kerja eh
esok kerja petang seh
you know my tempat kerja ada budak baru
it's a malay guy then he budak T
he's on internship and because I thought when he masuk
usually kalau
oh I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so macam terkejut like oh you from polytechnic I'm like oh ya
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the macam
like you know the courses tu semua how the works tapi macam
macam sensitive issue lah because they usually macam
deal with macam money money um orang bayarkan
dorang bayar duit tu join courses tu semua so maybe they like
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes ke apa ke
so they will only let the senior yang kerja lama kat sana tu
so kita orang usually ada
kita duduk counter jer kat
ya lah dekat office ah
so dah passion card layan tu ni but then
to um apa tu apply for you know the
under macam not everything can buat right
a'ah especially kalau macam the
issue is about government punya duit like government bagi duit because of this COVID right so they'll think like
they already like refer them to us then after that kita orang macam then they come to the then after that we tell them that
then you know macam tak happy lah
ya then after that the other day got this one makcik lah she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
we cannot even like use other people punya computer
your issue lah tapi macam for us is sensitive because
sekali kalau apa-apa ya
sekali your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
jap tengok dia punya battery
ya so I said go to but then dorang cakap ah very far I cannot walk and all
oh but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit leceh so far
adik stop
dia cakap she applied
uh apa tu she passed away
that means the person punya mum
but then they keep like arguing macam
especially if it's like racial issue macam
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a makcik who came
if there's a makcik who come by
tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita kan melayu
so it's like that my kerja is like that
uh as a housing officer dekat dormitory punya office
mm I'll be in the office lor so basically kalau that office is for the foreign workers kalau let's say they have
pay them on time ke apa like this kind of problem they will come to the office and tu
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing macam roundings ke apa ke so you like
dia kata macam you know macam Expo event but every day
eh medical interview pula the medical check-up
dorang berbual english
orh okay tu tempat landed landed nya tempat oh okay okay
then kalau macam
so that means the classes macam
like let's say if the that means one teacher ada fifteen right then means half of that
macam like around tujuh ke lapan orang then halfway dorang uh balik tidur
they also belajar
usually macam after dorang punya macam so called
before that makan ke lepas tu makan
oh dorang makan dulu eh orh so macam
then makan
jaga budak ya I think it's
dia macam malu eh
cakap lah kau nak cakap dulu ke aku cakap dulu
eh abeh yang sulaiman tu
kau cakap apa dia ajak kau gi ubi eh gi pancing
but which part of pulau ubin kau pergi pancing
apa yang dekat jetty
is it the place that that time you saw me and my friend pancing
kampung melayu ada satu jer kan
then after that malam tu kau dapat ikan
kat hidung wah
aiya ya ya ya tu jer satu ikan potong steam
then lepas tu sulaiman jumpa kau kat sana ke dia jumpa kau kat singapore
then kau pancing from what time to what time
but you you go there with no intention of pancing ah
the place where you guys pancing was a a man made structure then but why he asked whether you want to stay there because when I air pasang all all around you semua

bukan johan johan nama orang
johan tu nama orang ini jahan ya
ah medium lah all the medium then no no jahans then um we caught one stingray ah small lah kecil ah uh then
I think we caught like what countless number of crabs lah we caught like twenty then the thing about the crab right we never bring apa yang kau campak tu ah we don't have bento and we don't have apa yang people usually throw

tak lah he ah to the jetty the ah
taxi ya the taxi the best part is my friend already ask eh nak beli bento tak
then ah tak apa ah malas sangat bawa
then in the end we go there then because we got no bento no jala no what so in the end we use rod stand
rod stand the metal rod stand then we we just asar the tip make sure it's slightly sharper lah we go inside the water
we see we see we see one crab we whack so all the crabs right the twenty plus ah all got one lubang

so I keep the story to myself first then the next day I ask nos eh nos beside yang tempat we pancing got kampung ah then tak ada lah then I was like
oh tak ada ah pukul tiga pagi lepas aku tukar umpan
I heard ada macam ada orang tengah azan and I I stood there for quite some time lah just to make sure I'm hearing it correctly lah eh kau tak bilang ah
oh kau tak kejut aku then I was like apa nak kau jangka buat apa dah kat situ
so he was like um tertidur
then he tried to sleep you know ah he always try to sleep when he pancing one then he try to sleep then he cannot sleep know then dia pusing pusing pusing then he he looked to the right
then you know that that place have you went to that place before there's like this big tree lah kat tengah-tengah in the middle of the open area then he wake up then he looked to his side
he was quite close to the tree lah then he saw one nenek one nenek
walk pass then he was like ah the nenek told him like cu cu dah tahu sini tempat keras kan asal malap jer di tempat you eh macam tempat you pula eh no no no not that
why why um malap jer tempat cucu ni tak bagus tahu malap-malap like he was just saying like is not good that the place that they was fishing is dim like because my friend usually he bring one big torchlight lah but that day he just never on it lah then
apa tu err macam this one is mystics lah like mystic mystic stuff so he was like
keep quiet then rilek-rilek then the nenek um turned and walked away walked into the forest or something like that lah
then the driver say got one time he was passing by ah at night ah then he actually saw at the pokok there ada err pocong ah tengah
so it it means that like that nenek come to actually warn them that that place very malap then got other stuff also lah then that that nenek just go there to warn them lah like be careful you see
ya is ya so but that place that place quite is is quite nice lah but it's just malam ya malam kena jaga-jaga ya
no no there was no building around us so is is like okay this one is where the driver will drive eh drive then this is an open area di sini ada satu pokok in the middle
path ah actually the right path also can you will see pulut ketam in front of you that stretch like that ah towards the tip lah you can see the whole tip of pulau ketam
then your past few days macam mana your past few months ah ah the time the last
time I met you then you say you just berhenti kerja pe you just stop work
so apa you you apply mostly what type of apa industry
what phone call eh kau cakap bahasa melayu sikit kau english all the way eh have you never notice beginning
so you apply for your job back to back to the story ya back to the cerita so kau dah apply kerja habis semua tak dapat ah all all rejected you
sakit hati ah
surrounding have a few other masjid in the east
no lah I think this kind of things right is where you as a person who have experience have background juga kan
you will need to come in and explain to them oh tak lah this the way the reason why I letak the moderator first then followed by the asatizah then followed by err fandi ahmad is because
um according to my knowledge in the industry like I took diploma and whatsoever uh I know that first kau kena letak the moderator first
why why why the moderator first pasal dia yang akan moderate everything then followed by the asatizah who are
no lah to me I guess is in it really boils down to people's knowledge and also how flexible they are in this type of macam situasi lah
ya that's why lah that's not like you said lah is tak professional lah
of course is the comic lah because it shows that things are being brought down to your level itself it's not that you your age group akan dibawa naikkan to the adult level so you know that
when you go you will experience things that dalam kamu punya age group lah so it's better for you in that sense ah
ya and also actually I I actually salute people who do freelance photography and everything because the camera dah berapa mahal then err the time you took to edit I actually
pernah I pernah help you out with the edits even though I got no knowledge ah tentang video ah the video that
the video that I recorded the video that I recorded was for one of my internship lah then after that then apa tu the thing is
kenapa tak ada any background in Photoshop ke apa ke so nak edit tak tahu macam mana nak edit so I ask you for help that time
and the thing is it wasn't like per say it was tak susah because tak banyak animation tak banyak at that time lah it's just
trying to put two videos together to match the sequence itu pun dah boleh jadi gila
then ya I understand because as a programmer nanti I do some programs ke apa and I mean some more I'm getting paid know because I'm an intern
later dah dah buat setengah jalan nanti eh hakim um actually the client tak suka uh this part of the game ah can change it then dalam hati aku macam what it took me hours to get that part working
so I need to change and then I need to figure out I need go and research tengok whether apa tu apa yang client tu nak is feasible tak can it be included
into the program itself macam the way the mechanics works and everything then I need time so oh sakit
true story actually sebelum ni banyak cerita dah cakap
no lah is is just pelik lah
dah start merepek
you know the back to the story sikit right just now I talk about my intern so my intern kan I was being paid err one thousand dollars
eh rilek ah rilek ah dengar dulu but but the thing is the time err I'm from
so bila kita um want to sign up for apa tu for internship you need to go through this website ah I forgot what's the website oh my apa website dia ah
ada lah website tu ada ada lah masih situ ah
so I went I went there then I went to search the thing is right I filter my search according to gaji so the highest paying one I highlight it first I I
I filtered it according to whether I I want to do the job then after I filter then there was like I think fifteen over ah fifteen over jobs okay then I filtered through gaji like which one is higher pay lah
then I went in then I went in rilek-rilek talk with my colleagues then got other interns juga situ they are leaving already
then I was like eh your gaji berapa ah how much kau dapat every month one thousand huh eh one thousand sikitnya
wah sikitnya one thousand then they look at me like how much you are getting paid then I like oh according to the website they say I'm getting paid like I don't know lah but
then comes my paycheck I went to see one thousand then I like apa hal ni
malas you know typical malay right
like you know typical malay ah once you know you need to go the extra mile it's okay lah rezeki di mana-mana
no you will say can boleh macam mana oh you need to sign up this you need to do that ah tak apa
Grab lah last time you were talking about Grab because ya no because I was like trying to go see macam dia punya timeline ah like what do you
kau cakap kau nak kerja Grab I mean as a
Deliveroo oh betul eh jauh
if you if you hustle even more macam hustle demi hustle jer is like that then usually you can get like four four orders
if you really can't get anything because apa tu okay lah I got learn some finance also lah kan you should know lah so is is quite is quite a need to actually like have some kind of
ways for you to get money in lah rather than just duit terkeluar duit terkeluar then also I know that you have been out of job for quite some time
then it's not that you don't want to find job it's just the rezeki belum masuk lagi in terms of your full time whatsoever so I
if I'm if I'm you then start off with delivering dulu lah then while delivering then you can because when you do part time
take off like okay ah pukul sebelas sebelas sampai pukul empat ah I want to do delivery I got nothing much to do so it's it's quite a good
from your house sini jalan kaki punggol sengkang further eh macritchie further
mana seh
kenapa tu kenapa ada kick tu how long
dulu twenty four click take so long
macam might as well lah I park my motor somewhere
okay abang so how our renovation plans
hari raya wah you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate hari raya yet
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate hari raya
why are we talking about hari raya
so nanti I pergi um
nanti I pergi Popular I beli cardboard
I beli kertas yang keras tu then uh I
cari gambar nanti I print
nanti I cetak nanti I print lepas tu nanti boleh tampal lah dekat cardboard itu
tak lah itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya
apa designer itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita just um
kita just baca-baca jer tak tahu betul ke tak ke kan
buat lawak ah
kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang company err company itu nak apa nak
tunjuk kita nak bagi kita kan jadi
jadi kita just
kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi jer lah letak kat dalam mood board itu
hari itu I dah tunjuk you gambar dekat WhatsApp dah tengok belum
ha ya lah habis group mana
corak oh okay ah if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
betul juga uh uh eh paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua uh apa itu
uh almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu
orang yang uh cucikan sofa
sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu actually dari daripada minyak masak
lepas itu uh yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat uh platform itu
yang yang dulu actually nak buat musollah lepas itu tak jadi
sebenarnya bukan nak hack nak nak buang uh yang lama punya platform sebab
sebab platform itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput
tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput lah itu dah nak err dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang
lepas itu bawah platform itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak
uh huh buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak vinyl dulu kan lepas itu nanti dah ada
letak vinyl dan kalau ada budget then baru boleh tambah platform
okay tak apa itu nanti
that one I that one that idea came from tak I nampak hari itu my friend dia tengah buat renovation sekarang
lepas itu dia upload dekat uh story
lepas itu dia pakai glass itu ah um dia pun ada that same same sama punya segi balcony lepas itu dia
ah dia dia yang dia yang I nampak daripada story dia lah yang dia pakai glass itu kalau tidak I pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak replace that that tingkap dengan
dengan apa so idea dia datang itu lah I ternampak story my friend
dia ada tag hari itu tapi I tak ingat ada dia ada tag uh
dia dia popular juga apa eh nama dia eh tak ingat ah
ya habis sekarang I scolding ah everytime they upload video
ah nanti I pergi intai dia punya video tengok apa progress cari idea
abang you boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada you tolong scolding kan ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah I
I kan tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya uh tingkap cantik
dia satu yang dia pakai yang uh sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya uh yang macam ketat
uh ketat punya macam mana nak cakap eh yang ada yang ada handle eh
ah tapi cantik dia macam simple saja tapi cantik
tapi masalahnya sekarang sliding pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun
tak lah tingkap okay actually dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari supplier sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah lah
ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah already yang kan sudah
dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat tau dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja I bila kat dapur baru bunyi
sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar you tak bunuh dia sebab itu I cakap kena panggil
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot lah I cannot tahan already is
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like merajuk
you tahu macam merajuk perempuan ah okay lah okay lah apa
saya tipu lah saya tipu lah okay lah bye bye
emotional ah uncle itu
tak boleh lupa eh kelakar
okay whatever you call it ah ya that one also some already uh like uh apa itu
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already merepek right
maybe lah he want to save that way or what alamak then I regret seh sekarang menyesal seh tak pakai tiles yang kita pilih
dah bersusah payah kita pergi hafari lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi ya kan saja
itu lah dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak uh tak licin tak jatuh
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever pun so
habis uh nak kena plan nak kena
plan itu lagi budget lagi nak kena plan budget nanti you bilang I nanti I buatkan breakdown
kan so kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa kan toilet pun kita baru buat cuma maybe kalau tiles itu memang
tak bagus itu tukar saja lah sebab dia punya slope pun ingat tak kita kan suruh dia buat slope jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi
pun masih bertakung tau I cuci toilet pun I tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya slope dia
uh uh tapi yang macam accessories macam tempat mandi uh apa itu picit-picit nak cebok ah tu semua
uh boleh pakai balik ah so at least itu dah save cost sebab itu pun under dalam quotation juga
ah itu dah save cost lah lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah
kalau let's say ada budget untuk buat yang rumah punya pun actually perabot tak payah cuma kita just ambil gambar ah kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada
tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun considered
uh apa itu macam modern apa modern minimalist pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu kan senang sikit lah
mm modern juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak mm
lagi apa eh kita dah tukar eh
so far yang kat dalam toilet itu ya lah kan lampu uh ya so hopefully
mm tak ada lah sekarang plan dia is ini tak standard plan is one uh kitchen two toilet
sebab itu kalau you nak buat kitchen saja ini susah memang dia comes together so might as well buat saja
sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit you tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga K habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit then end up kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya kan
so kita betul-betul buat sekaligus lah lagi pun toilet
lagi pun uh bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah kan habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu ah
eh sekali terus habuk semua lah
ah betul
lagi bilik bilik aqi pun
mm bilik aqi pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang vinyl vinyl sahaja
dah berapa uh that time eight hundred kan lapan ratus vinyl sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini
kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu toilet itu semua nak kena
mm kalau kita buat balik lah
itu kan pintu toilet itu kan dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena nak kena
hack nak kena plaster balik
semua akan affected
tapi ini click function kan vinyl itu remember
tak boleh lah ini ini kena potong kena apa kena measure sembarang saja
entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi ha
tak boleh dah haus you tengok dia punya
dia punya tengok ini dah hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada gap lah dia dah ada jarang-jarang in between dia punya ini kayu
then how how because vinyl pun boleh kembang ikut uh panas atau sejuk tau bilik
ah dalam bertahun ah ini ini pun macam tak tukar ha ini dah kembang lah ini nampak line dia ada gap
lepas itu tak boleh ada gap itu hit itu lah dia dah ini merekah lah itu
uh uh eh ini tak bagus ini I think murah punya ini bukan yang vinyl tau ini yang
dia orang pandai kan eh
ah cerita cerita apa ah yang the worst witch
it's about this uh kid lah abeh dia ada power but then dia dia macam harry potter tapi it's about females it's witches
quite fun lah to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja kan so I just watch like whatever I can find lah on netflix then that popped out so I watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
tapi dia orang pun baru pe so that kind of standard pe
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa ah dia orang naik harga kan
banyak benda sia naik harga my google drive also naik harga
I haven't seen any updates on it but I know google dah ada
assignment apa sia
I mean it will get better lah I mean yang COVID ni semua bukan like forever what they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu ah
tengok ah
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa sia
but ada juga ah macam sikit
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
mm masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
banyak sangat benda kan
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
I think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli pe it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
habis smite apa jadi
oh really cause I know that day uh siapa naim asked uh ilyas to join but then ilyas said like the file was like twenty one he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
mm four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for ilyas so like dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why ah ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like oh I cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us jer
I think baru ah like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his ya
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue lah he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
probably go with good looks but I mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun I mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru I mean you can't really do that also what so probably good looks
ya I guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
I mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit ah
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff lah kalau tak then there's really like no point
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
kalau ni hari not much lah I'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe I shall do that
rasa macam free kan
sekarang muka macam maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu lah tak nak panjang sangat pun
kalau kat rumah hmm
netflix lepas tu
main and playing a bit of
apa lagi ah
uh no I haven't played cause like I don't know macam
main dengan naim and muhammad they very competitive and then like if ilyas is not there like can't really
so I usually kalau dia orang dua jer then I I avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main ah cause I
I mean the same thing happened bila that time I tried to download kat my macbook apa
cause I don't think they have a punya file
oh ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah ah
I mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
uh pergi ah
so what the cow is the hantu or like
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
the latest the one I think just got removed what the kampung
I don't know buangkok some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
uh orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time I went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu ah
ya went there and then dia orang cakap uh tempat tu memang ada benda ah like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik ah like this chinese auntie
abeh dia orang cakap macam um like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur lah just let it be
we film from I think like we arrived there at six ah so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
and then we had to delay and then wait then um when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change ah cause
dia ah she's like I think some
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun lah but macam
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
we were kind of worried lah that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god lah like nasib ah
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary ah to see her in the dark
ya lah but then it's the only kampung I know that exists in singapore lah
that kampung
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam uh tiga caucasian people ang moh like white people
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok ah then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam oh what you're doing
they like oh okay cool cool and jalan
quite a few like um there's a lot of kampung houses lah but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang jer tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang ah
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff ah and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
besar juga ah like maybe it's about the size of like one small area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
it's all kayu and then like very old school lah semua macam
stay in the kampung
ya it's quite gelap I mean there there is a few street lights ah like around the area but it's quite dark and then um
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment kan so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and I'm like um no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing one
dia hantu baik then I'm like okay
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
tiga tahun eh it's quite recent sia
but like kesian juga ah like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
I want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay ah
pergi satu kali ah when in maybe secondary school
tiga wish
oo okay lah kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil jer lah kalau kalau bayar then okay ah aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat dekat rumah aku okay lah and
I mean ya memang ah like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like oh you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
but I don't think macam
kat bawah block
huh sini takde banyak kucing
only got lembu
have you seen your cat luar
seram sia
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad lah macam
hmm bila like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak sia it's like cannot breathe and stuff
sekarang if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy ah like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when I mandi him like
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
the president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it eh
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi I just I just want to give you a warning eh kau stop jer eh jangan buat lagi tau

err eh is it ah ah ke dalam pukul dua gitu gitu check-in
eh tak lah wah we play mm wah that was the first time my layang-layang flied so high eh it was like wow
think we checked-in then we what did we have ah I cannot remember apa kita makan kat sana I think oh you know before that right kita pergi Arab Street makan dekat this place near Masjid Sultan
I think it's called err ape minang kah ape I can't remember the name
like um the minang err the cuisine name
no eh it was cheap like it was considered macam atas street food
but wah the food was so good until now I'm thinking about dia punya tahu telur wah sedap oof
yeah then we wah we nasib baik ah kita dapat err swimming slot for both for all three days
oh tu tak tau but I know they have like satu jam punya slot habis tu thirty minutes for cleaning
oh no no like we boleh masuk untuk satu jam habis tu before the next slot they will clean for thirty minutes then there is a next slot
yeah we lucky lah cause some people tak dapat so yeah
err oh the last day kita pergi right we went at err I think lapan setengah pagi habis tu hujan
tak ah mandi aja lah
sejuk ah
no err hari kedua we went to ape tu Garden By The Bay
yeah masuk dalam
okay lah I will lagi
tak eh cause they limit the occupancy
and I'm like wah tak banyak orang
uh tu pun pergi boring seh pergi banyak kali
err cause is like if not for this situation kita pun tak pergi nya cause mahal seh on normal days
I think around there kat sana tu
wanted to have like graduation staycay also tak dapat seh
uh tak dapat reply nak buat ape
wah actually dia punya shift panjang seh
belum the result only coming out err bulan depan there yeah
yeah my siblings say I'm a bum a home bum so I'm like okay tu pun jadi lah
yeah I mean some of the requirements also I don't meet lah macam what ada kan diploma lah atau experience lah then I'm like I don't have any
uh I'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan dah start sekolah ape kalau gitu
eh I play with me I will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
I don't I I err boleh boleh tanya orang lain
oh err ada lah or
ya because they tengok a lot of TikTok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny I like I want to try nak cuba
oh my god it's like okay so I watched his TikTok of the like they play Among Us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's David he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
mm betul wah I miss playing night games with people
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small UNO atau Among Us then I'm like
err all meat but I can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then I always make a big fuss right I hate the smell
I mean tak boleh predict pe so
yeah especially since err nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
twenty eight agak near lah kena check again
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain seh
entah lah dia orang nak jumpa makan lah nak jumpa belajar then I'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then I macam aiya whatever lah it's up to them then next week ah minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like oh kita tunggu untuk Carea to like give when she free to meet then I'm like
yeah then eh I just open the chat habis tu I kan I just say mm err you guys go ahead I'm not free
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan I tak boleh makan
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu pe selalu it's very easy for us to settle food what
yeah then is don't know lah is that time like I think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like oh let's eat Umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
yeah it's like oh let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
yeah I understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat seh why did I go out I regret going out of the house
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
uh yeah aigoo dah lah tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal hais
oh I was so confused by it I I didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
yeah I mean it's very different perspective of problems lah like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
cause even for my school cause Ngee An kan ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun I there was this period of time I had like macam class right then every time if I reach school dekat this certain timing I will see that makcik that cannot see then I will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
oh forest no tak dengar eh
wah was the forest fire macam bad
oh my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
I guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
wah ah speaking of Kelly and her mum the cake that she mm baked untuk your birthday wah I still think of it sometimes
yeah cause I mean I think the cake macam dry because dah simpan satu hari pe dah potong then you give it to them the next day but wah the whipped cream I was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream kan diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain kan and we were like err dia tak kan beli cake kan like err err err
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then I like I like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone kan then dia eh guys Nisha pakai aku punya handphone then we were like oh did she see the chat
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
yeah eh I can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
err sekarang dah ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
no no I was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan I was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
right it's ugh and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
wah you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the I think is the merchandise I was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
mm I see so many Youtube videos of people like they are not fans but their room is covered in punya bantal</malay lah dia punya soft toy then I like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the chibi the tiny Tan oh my god oh I wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then I'm like
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product tau I was like ugh
yeah that's why when I renew my membership right the membership kit is like twenty then after that I checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then I like
oh no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible I guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh lah just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater lah then I also looking at this skirt
yeah err I think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
tak it's just I want to save up the money first
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical I don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory lah so yeah
dah boleh off
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit

but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam

sekarang aku tak boleh tak boleh gila-gila sangat doh
oh my god did I tell you ex aku tulis surat kat aku lagi
aku delete ah lepas tu aku deleted the the surat
I got the notification ah so out of curiosity I went to go and read it then when I read it I'm like eh aku seriously just eh
aku tak sabar nak makan nasi pengantin on sunday
a'ah because kawan aku ni like she she nikah already in september
not very practical so she decided to do her sanding on sunday but that is her side then her husband side is going to do the sanding next month
aku tengok dia aku cakap kat dia wow you're the only person I know that gets married three times
tak lah besok punya sanding eh besok punya sanding sunday's sunday's ceremony she's doing it at home it's supposed to be kat bawah block ah but
she apa ni
and then her husband's side however is going to do kau tahu kat mana

ya my friend also like she's not even excited for this sunday dia cakap like there's no point like
kalau aku kahwin dengan andre
bila free jumpa ah kita pergi minum then I'm like aku baca terus tak reply
aku just malas like what is the point of you telling me this ah like
kau just boleh ah like pretend that nothing happened like
bila kau beli rokok dia orang tak minta ke
bodoh nak jer cuci mata dia ni
that's all and then the next the next message he sent me was I think like two days ago and he said like hey I know this is weird but can I ask you for a favour then aku macam seram sejuk tau aku macam what favour sia this fellow want to ask
ya like now apa they don't even play music there
only now because now all the social distancing people like go there and like check like if you want to lepak at the beach also
so like when he tell me he want to like ask me for this favour like a part of me was like a a little bit like macam
vindicative so I was like sure even if you get the place kat dalam otak aku ah aku fikir you want to get the place tutup mm it not gonna be fun ya
makan cake
mabuk tak ingat dunia sia kau
tapi kau fun ah when you're drunk you're not troublesome drunk ah
kau tak drunk pun kau funny bodoh
habis kena marah dengan security guard
pasal kau main skateboard kat lobby condo dia lah bodoh
dah tua tak tahu tak sedar diri nak main skateboard
got no sand nearby so I see already I'm like okay nevermind lah but okay then my ex like no no it's okay got life jacket got life jacket if not you can hold on to me I'm like okay fine sial lah the minute I jumped into the water I straight away like just started screaming like no no no no no I want to go back I want to go back on the boat sampai the freaking thai boat man pun ketawakan aku sial then my ex like no it's okay it's okay I'm like no if you don't put me back on the boat I will cry here now that was my threat I will cry that's it
like a kid like he hold out the hand habis badan aku kat atas tangan dia and even then I was freaking out I was like no cannot then he was like babe why are you scared my hands are right here how are we going to travel ha and then go swimming and all these nice places I'm like um I'll I'll swim in the shallow waters
bodoh kau hiccups
we are going to entah
I also cannot like panas sial only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile I will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because I know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but I will wake up to him cuddling
it is only when I'm very tired like most of the time right I wake up but then then I see okay lah he already wake up he cause I know he always wake up very early then I say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun kan but I cannot like the bed very comfortable lah then I just go back to sleep
so sometimes I wake up then I turun bawah already cause he's doing work right then I see breakfast dah ada
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed mandi take out his clothes and stuff and all that lah so
then he was okay he he still can layan okay ten thirty aku tak bangun kadang-kadang I will wake up early I'll wake up at eight but then ah because I wake up too early right then I tell myself okay lah my alarm ten thirty uh no my alarm at nine thirty so I can still sleep I still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep lah bloody hell then when I wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then I see my message he already
ya see so so it's not that there is nothing to do it's because kau orang pemalas
I wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he makan lunch already he go back to office
with andre I'm thinking whether I should get him a batik shirt ah to match me but kedai mana ada jual sekarang
pukul berapa dia orang buka dia orang buka tak saturday
pukul berapa dia orang buka because if
arab street punya mahal doh
cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or tangs I think and then I was thinking okay by the time kita habis we will probably be eating dinner
and then we will go to town so I won't have time to go and bring him there then I was thinking kalau dia orang buka pagi then I can go and buy first
and then harap-harap ah dia boleh muat
because I don't think he got I don't think he got I don't think he got baju that will match that colour dia ada baju yang boleh match ni
he will eat lah he will eat he he he likes food in general babe dia tak picky when it comes to makan dia tak picky like even when you spicy like deepavali aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk
do it do it do it babi
ya I must like spare my baju-baju or what I mean I have some of like my my things there but I don't have my clothes there I have my workout stuff I have my my boxing gloves are there
like I already have a toothbrush there and he already bought a shampoo for me that's there so like that one all tak payah fikir lah but other than that he's bald what he want to wash
like that thing anak luar nikah jer
no like okay maybe they got married at eighteen pasal ada anak
wow there's a lot of way way sia macam
okay dalam segi agama I would say okay like really just wise like follow your religious maybe it's a good thing lah like just to settle down like err apa to prevent like any sins or any like um what does it call
no no mm haram and thing and like macam um uh what is it macam the bad like people won't talk bad about you what does that thing call
so macam apa ya
honestly no ah because like nanti macam ingat kau macam main main
like you think what this one main main is it like you what your girlfriend you break up patch back patch back merepek what
ya so like I think okay maybe eighteen is a legal age but no I think that's like marriage like maybe that's too young but unless like how to say like ah I've heard lah stories macam aku nampak yang they got married at seventeen or sixteen ya islam
that's the thing I don't know is it in singapore or malaysia ah malaysia ku entah leh maybe it's normal maybe is not lah but like they say like you know then I see and the thing is the best part is that both parents like err what is restu
ah ah they give restu ah they give I the blessing ah dorang kasih blessing dorang
then it's like wow like that's I think that's takes a lot of courage ah for parents nak kasih restu like to cover him at the young age but then we don't know what the reason the actual reason behind lah kan
now the only thing I can think of when you say young marriage is like maybe they did something or maybe they just like tak sabar
they just want to like so macam like oh
if I get married oh you know everything will be like halal you know macam ni ni ni ni like actually ah he's the one or like you know what I don't know how to explain but like macam
so if later macam if it's just reflects to the people and there's like oh kau tengah stereotype just because I'm young
for me ah okay ah kalau kau tanya aku persendirian aku tak tahu ah because like I think I I really believe yang macam apa ya love does not apa ya time does not define love ke love does not define time ada kat that thing ah
like kalau kau jatuh cinta kalau kau like you and then you feel like he's the one he's the one ah because like I heard stories like my apa apanya cikgu
she was in a relationship ever since like in secondary school sampai ke tua like twenty six like that she was schooling my school like she was ready she was asking to marriage but then guy still wanted to play around
like macam he he wasn't serious he still don't want to get married
no no not not the other chicks lah like macam he's just not ready for marriage dia tak dia tak belum fikir kan lah okay for my cikgu kan she's like okay let's say lepak ah ya
okay the guy likes to lepak jam beberapa jam ke dua tiga pagi tau just lepak bawa blok berbual-bual rokok tu semua right my teacher is like by eleven is like eh aku tak penat jah like I want to go home I want to sleep like so like that ya so macam they they I think it's like eight years' relationship
ya ya they call it off they dia orang tak tunang pun ya they broke up she broke up with him and then after that err kak got to know
find new people think she dated one I think like less than a year and I saw she tunang and then after that a year after that she got married ya ya
ya that's the thing like actually I was shocked that she she like she was okay lah maybe dia ada rasa sedih lah I mean siapa tak rasa sedih kan kalau break up
but she's like you know what this is not what I want like like she knows what she wants tu aku yang jawab aku respect kau ah
you really follow me ah eh kalau ikutkan hati aku
I mean like I've been single for the longest time for so macam like
you know you just gonna get any guy then kalau like kau okay aku okay kita go ah sia
but then it's like okay let's say kau
kau dengan my dear kau berapa lama
boleh but then you think your parents will agree
oh tak boleh sambung uh huh
ya I think I've heard stories like they they they just like marry by paper but they still macam go on lah macam I think they are like schooling or something macam let's say kes kalau ni ah
from there ah then masuk like okay lah slowly perlahan perlahan kayuh ah
society nya sekarang now is like I think apa ever since okay let's say our generation ah eh like okay let's say my after our parents' generation like maybe the like early nineties or like the late eighties all of them run dusted the career minded path semua yang tak nak kahwin pun

apa on the YouTube or apa yang dekat television ah so for me I pun suka tengok
ah football match and which is zaman gemilang during apa the malay cup yes itu kita berapa tahun eh we were like
macam ah maybe in our teens eh there was the enjoyable time macam anak-anak kita will not
so that time was wah macam
pergi sana beratur going there
then apa duduk kat the bench you know the the the bench yang lama tu kan
dah tak ada cannot
sekarang apa stadium pun dah dibuat baru very macam high technology it can it can actually consist of banyak
uh apa uh spectators you know fifty sixty sixty thousand so
with apa the ability to macam so much apa
ah apa ah the good facility why can't we revive the apa
punya apa ah um
satu message jer cakap ah I be late I lambat

tapi you kena pakai ni you have to wear macam protection punya apa
ah macam so called covered our shoe tu kan
ah and of course lah obviously you tak boleh apa
ah macam hentak-hentak lah kan
tapi yang kita disappointment tu pasal kita tak boleh pergi naik apa tu the famous cable car
itu we were hoping pasal banjir kan so tutup because ada land slide
bukit bendera the punya famous ah
cable car kalau you datang penang you mesti naik tu ah but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup kan pasal land slide so we we cannot go
ah so okay lah macam itu macam really disappointed tapi kita dah like I said kita pergi pun terjun botol kan
kita tak tahu apa-apa ah whether masih banjir because on the news totally ah almost tiap-tiap hari kita tengok news
banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping ah
tapi the thing ya lah kalau let's say kita cancel but there is no travelling restriction we don't get back
kalau macam let's say ah the the minister ah okay no restriction tak boleh pergi penang ah then yes
son kalau topic dengan berbual dengan driver pun one of it is ah apa cakap pasal apa banjir itu lah
a'ah kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go longer way lah longer route
conserving atau err uh
and one of the attraction kita pergi ah yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti because eh
err penang tu like I said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu bukit bendera tu so kalau ah I think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum lah dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa
food ah food museum lah upside down museum ada three three three D museum three D museum so kita pergi I think about kita pergi dua ya bang kan kita pergi dua museum tapi yang upside down tu bagus
ada juga ah
kita dapat seratus eh seratus
tapi sana bayaran dia dalam malaysia ringgit bang sini singapore dollar so kat sana pun kalau dorang
charge apa ah apa empat puluh ringit kan bagi kita ah just about
lain cerita lah kan kalau let's say kat sana pun kita kalau beli makan pun in ringgit you know macam alah jangan cakap lah apa rindu lah dengan apa malaysia ada kat sana ah
betul ah
kita family of four ah
can be found ye lah
ah bosan kita tiga orang aja um kita ye lah apa ah apa
kita tengok kita dengar dari news kan oh there's no apa ah zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero lah make it zero make it zero kan
then kalau macam tempat locations oh dekat sini ada apa visited by COVID nineteen
so we try to avoid lah that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga kan macam eh hari tu ada kat ion hotel ah ion orchard hotel ah ah orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana kan tapi kena ikhtiar lah
what what we can do is that like I say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already
ah so let's say kita pakai apa pakai hand sanitiser
okay then ada disposable bag
dua puluh dua puluh satu dua puluh satu tu ah memang apa harapan banyak lah dalam apa dua puluh dua puluh satu
bukan only bukan only financially financially memang itu kalau orang dekat singapore ni mesti
hopefully ah apa naik gaji naik pangkat
okay lah but you know we have to be realistic ah kan sekarang ni kita like I say still in a pandemic situation kan
secara tak langsung kita nak ah apa increase kita punya ah
number of children family members ah tu yang kita target lah inshallah kalau ni in dua puluh dua puluh satu kan ah
ah if everything goes smoothly and the planning is semua betul inshallah then we can apa
have a try another one doesn't matter lah like I said it's a boy or girl twins ke apa ke you know semuanya datang dari dia kita terima lah
tapi tapi kita mesti ada satu kepala lah
kan kalau let's say kalau you ada
you punya vision you tu oh macam gini gini tapi kalau macam orang keliling you tak cooperate tak ada kasi kerjasama akan pengsan juga bang ah so it's like you know kalau you know kalau your vision must be clear ah kalau let's say
tak munasabah tak adil ah macam you you apa
kalau let's say dia dia tak nak ikut kita punya apa perancangan kita cara kita tapi kalau ada masalah jer oh fall back ah datang balik pada you eh kau tolongkan aku gini kan tak boleh lah gitu macam bagi
bagi I ye lah macam you you ni apa kepala keluarga eh kan ah tapi jangan lupa isteri pun ada peranan dia kan isteri dia ialah dian punya neck neck tu apa bang
ah leher pada apa ah
ya lah ya lah so ya lah itu then then then
ah apa kawan-kawan apa relative lain tu anak kita adik kan dia is part of the body lah kan itu akan jadi seorang orang lah kan
special eh tapi you think
ah tahun twenty twenty one dia boleh macam
kita punya kes tu dia boleh move forward tak macam kita boleh apa dapat sekolah ke

and then she jeling at me
it's called sekali gus
ya because if a goose goes out and buy things and carry everything in one trip it's called sekali gus
I have never seen where mister teh tarik is at jurong
like banyak banyak
that one thing you did lunch time right banyak banyak kan
it's still rezeki
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she she stayed that she she she's most loyal one lah down there right and then after that rina uh uh recently only um enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers I mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
I am not sure then I think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing lah but you think hanisah is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not lah but it's not worth it I think it's very bodoh
me or is it she and then I I argue with her over it you know like I tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more I tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no what
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
by the way I have a footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti

tak penat ke dah dah lari habis tu nak main badminton nak anuh evolve lagi best nya gitu
like I join choir habis tu
it look at our experiences tapi
susah tau macam nak cari company macam gitu pasal
buangkan kerja apa-apa kerja pun dekat you then like you don't even know
tapi there's this like
she doing arts tapi
in my job I really put in a lot of effort I work hard tapi like this girl she just goes in and then like she just be friends with the manager habis tu
she gets the job like as a head you know and everything semua I buat tau
like she literally throw everything to me to do then she asked me how to do this not I teach her lah macam ajar dia nak buat
dorang tak actually buat
like the care like in that sense pasal they are only thinking about assessment academic
kesian seh budak-budak itu
to say that dorang tak boleh cakap
dorang tak tahu ke benda ni semua ada like
tak payah kerja kat situ lagi lah macam
kesian seh budak-budak macam gitu
itu lah
like my my parents tak
last time senang jer duduk dekat rumah tengok dah habis kerja dah habis sekolah tengok habis tu makan habis tu boleh baring tidur

ikut lah
sweet nya
okay lah like kalau you nak tips kan I will say
tapi jangan like take it too hard lah
it's it's just like how they expect you to be all these tapi
actually have lah my my mother ada kata sikit like last time
you know semut
minum kencing it's actually
try to reduce as much lah jangan minum banyak sangat
tapi kita selalu makan nasi seh hari-hari
sakit macam mana seh macam gitu
bukan senang seh macam gitu
so kalau gitu nak kena makan apa seh
itu lah
mahal juga seh
tapi sayur-sayuran jer tau
sayur-sayuran dengan sauce
betul lah tapi
kena jaga seh
kalau macam you know
like rosak kan you you call it
I rasa macam
so so they they drove back home dia naik naik kereta balik ke mana
rumah dia kat mana lah
tapi is that macam intentionally or
so dia tak
you tahu tak yang like
crazy lah macam it's a wild thing but then
budak-budak ni semua belajar dari mak bapa dorang pe
so kalau dorang kurang ajar dengan mak bapa dorang sendiri
anak dorang confirm ikut punya
tak akan lah anak tak sayang mak bapa
memang lah
tapi sedih tau like I see my parents kalau dorang
dia kan tinggal sorang
hope yang kadang-kadang dia tinggal dengan kita instead lah macam
she's alone dia sorang-sorang kat rumah
so if anything happens siapa nak jagakan dia seh
telephone dia ask her how is she all these like
quite old already kaki sakit
dari dulu tau dari kecil dia kata
bila dia dekat rumah kan dia rasa macam
dia kerja dekat McDonald tau
usually hari minggu gitu lah dia kerja like
two to three days gitu tapi
the day she worked kan makin sikit
kerja ah
geylang punya
pasar lah
just to macam jalan-jalan
tak okay habis tu
nak jalan sini nak jalan sana habis tu kalau anything happen siapa nak
jaga kan
tak tahu tak berapa tahu ah tapi
sixty to seven no tak lah
macam gitu ah
tua sangat tapi macam she at that age where she get her
she already have her semua tapi tak nak duduk kat rumah macam
pergi lah relax sikit ke apa
some more she stay alone tak akan lah want to work so hard also
nobody's taking care of her lah like bills semua
like kita punya families semua jaga kan
and from bills electricity bills kita pun bayar apa
kalau you kan
if you dah tua
dah ada duit tu semua kan
you nak pergi mana
ada tak tempat yang you nak
or attractions tapi jangan lah tua sangat ke macam like forty ke
bila I pergi kan
tembok tu cantik tau
the culture there is different okay lah dorang racists from what I heard
they are racists tapi macam their culture like how they move is like very free
the tembok tembok tembok bricks
tak faham lah tapi macam
tapi like
ada lagi ramai orang tua dari orang muda kan
um this orang-orang tua semua ni kan kena kerja keras pasal
like tengok
family dengan lima anak
abeh I pun macam tertanya tau macam
ah even the government helping them pasal macam like you can see tau macam
tak tahu family planning ke apa
like okay maybe they they love kids dorang sayangkan anak-anak
kids tapi
it seems very chaotic macam dorang tak tentu arah
dorang betul-betul suka lah anak-anak semua
but then not so big lah tak nak besar sangat
nanti siapa nak jaga seh nak kerja habis tu nak kena
I tak boleh masak I tak boleh
I tak tahu macam mana nak kemas rumah tau sebenarnya
I rasa
tak tentu arah like I don't know
siapa nak jaga seh so I have to
for now tengah cari kerja nak sustain
some maybe dapat
hopefully lah dapat
scholarship ke apa
kejadah scholarship untuk tolong
duit lah
pun tak faham sangat dorang tau dorang punya subject macam mana how you
on what I want to do apa I nak buat
dulu I
selalu go with the flow tau like I had I had the mindset ni to just go with the flow
I nak
cause a snowball effect to tau tu pasal I
dapat degree
pasal I see all my friends
kawan-kawan kan
semua dah habis degree tau
you nak tahu tahu you tahu tak
I malam-malam kan
kadang-kadang I fikir tau
kenapa I ambil
kalau I
didn't do anything I tunggukan boyfriend jer
I betul-betul harap
dorang accept I
pasal kan
I know it's gonna be tough tapi
I kena cuba
like if not now bila
I perlukan pertolongan lah in that area
marketing is on demand tu pasal lah susah nak cari kerja
tu lah kerja I dulu
betul you know like
pasal kita nak experiences kan they think they don't really take us
tapi actually I think yang if it is a very good
pasal if
tapi did you know that I mention
like I kata tadi like
even intern job dorang minta experiences
that is the funny part to me lah pasal dorang nak experiences tapi
they ask so you boleh imagine tak like
tapi you gotta
you gotta work hard for it lah macam
that's a very good question actually tapi kan talking about movies
you want a genre yang you suka tak
I suka
perlukan itu lah bantal
untuk cover muka
tak lah actually
I tengok
horror like not really horror it's like thriller tapi
you akan jumpa jodoh you juga trust me
so tak payah tak payah nak sedih-sedih semua
you ada Netflix tak

for ya so I thought okay you know what I don't wear like baju kurung I'm going to wear I'm going to specifically choose kurta
okay jadi kurta ni dia macam
it's very hard to find kurta dekat mana like to find where kurta is
ya so we went I don't know why but we decided tekka tekka confirm ada kurta
so but there was there's a lot of like err you know like indian wedding costume which is like lawa gila but ya oh ya that's true so so we found like a cheap one cause like I I macam I felt that it was err the first one that we tried was macam dia macam forty dollars
and lepas tu ya and then lepas tu kita went and find some more there are ada satu twenty dollars
ya ya so so kita ya so kita beli that one err without the pants you know just the baju
and then pakai baju and then okay kita nak makan sebab dia nak belanja dia nak belanja makan
so dia belanja makan and then dah belikan baju like it's a very good day so kita makan kat tekka kat bawah
it was so good macam sedap gila sebab ya
ah yang yang ada kaki escalator

macam mana tu kau handle aku pun sorry for you ah but
nanti appraisal dia kasih pun it's up to
bagus eh
ini tak boleh lah
down here ah the way they do appraisal macam mana tau okay appraisal time I give you the appraisal form you you go and grade yourself
actually I was kind of thinking of doing something macam similar
because I kind of miss macam
buat benda like I miss being like creative I guess
so like aku rasa like um
I follow a lot of macam Instagram shops actually and like
because like aku sekarang kirakan aku I don't have eh no no no sorry I have free time now
I mean I'm a bit I I was kind of used to dapat kerja but
yes dah so um I think
I think maybe I want to macam
I mean I I always see I selalu cakap nak
baju you know what I mean but then I I don't know ah I don't know where to start where do you start
I know that a lot of people have like macam
aku aku maybe rasa macam low-key aku boleh I can tell that some people
pandemic punya tu then like
and I mean I understand also lah cause aku pun sama juga
like at first aku pun sama juga but then like
aku macam low-key macam not not jealous but macam
I don't know how to explain the feeling ah I think I think aku macam
it makes me want to start my own not not that I want to start my own or what it's just macam
semua dia punya kedai semua macam sama-sama you know then like
obviously kita orang like feel like we can do better so
the thing is right yang yang kau cakap pasal the embroidery punya tote bag tu it's
honestly kan I nampak pernah nampak dekat TikTok
so like I I tend to scroll through and kadang-kadang I come across eh bukan apa uh the TikTok is like
macam shop punya lah then I saw this one I'm pretty sure it's a or or whatever it's a foreign punya
country punya shop then this girl basically
she does the same thing dia buat tote bag then she pakai sewing machine then the way that she realise
she can do the embroidery too it's because dia punya machine ada dia punya function abeh aku macam dalam kepala otak aku aku macam
isn't that like macam no offence
I understand it probably takes a time to macam like sit there and actually like betulkan settings and all it tapi macam
kalau it's like simple to and it's not her herself tengah embroidered right is the machine doing it
that orang singapore buat so macam kalau is macam simple gitu then like
one particular this uh apa ni account like jual
apa tu spectacle chain or whatever
maybe have baju custom fit for their own
kadang-kadang boleh pakai S kadang-kadang boleh pakai M depends lah uh most of the time S M gitu
then like you know how they have those uh sizes macam
kalau Cotton On they have um S M or like
how is it that this uh yang I tengah pakai ni like it's considered S M then I'm like does it fit every
you M but you on the verge of L like kau boleh sumbat ke ni
apa tu nama dia not really don't really have a lot of free ya loose so ya
to me and you I guess cause kita orang dua selalu baca kan so kita tahu like what's the difference
ada a few kedai kedai macam
online macam Loop Garms
there's also another one dekat jalan pisang yang Flame V that's that's one I always go to actually
because it's not that high sangat dia punya prices but ya like apa
and is actually this ah you tahu uh jericho
like he was really a fan of the nineties punya semua so
pernah pergi area itu then like macam a few times drop by already together
then I think dia selalu berbual dengan one of the owner I think isaac or whatever then um
I was like kenapa kau tak nak tanya jer jer lah but then he macam malu so I decided to do it
then apparently that shirt is a hundred dollars then aku macam
macam mana boleh hundred dollars ni macam expensive gila
maybe it's cause macam maybe it's imported from somewhere macam
then like they take into account like shipping fee and stuff like that tapi macam I don't know it's like
cause honestly it's not cause thrifting is macam
I mean the the concept is the same it's just that vintage kau betul-betul pay the price for the vintage ah thrifting
I mean in I think actually it is vintage if it's like lama gila and like
you can see that is macam been used before and stuff like that it is vintage in a sense but then vintage in my opinion is more like
because it can also be an investment what kalau
that shirt yang chris jericho punya shirt tu technically it can be an investment cause like
they maybe not don't really know of chris jericho ah cause dia kan lama-lama sikit kan
ah ya dia macam punya tu but like
ten twenty years down the road maybe even fifty years down the road maybe there will still be people who's still willing to macam
old like old outfits old trends and then they want to make it macam baru balik it's either they follow
is either they follow the old trends or they take the old trends and make it baru
kita orang just I don't know like how to I don't know how to explain pe seh but I guess like it's been berapa the fashion industry dah lama
ah dibina so like
like people dulu macam tak kesah but like at least now kita orang macam
lelaki tu meant well but then
kind of um macam mana nak cakap eh
macam misused it
right misuse and also macam ya lah just salah guna
I honestly I honestly think it's cause kita orang macam
just kita orang no longer live in that
so like once we use something we just nak buang
we we are actually talking about apa tu uh kedai right
you just cuba lah jual to to your like whoever who's ordered you ada berapa banyak order sekarang
oh tapi belum
orh yang uh yang backpack tu eh orh K
I think maybe you just try to sell to to the current orders sekarang ni yang you ada kan
you once you dah dibayar um
honestly kalau you nak kan promote is actually not that
you can actually macam
apa eh
but then if you buat macam specific ads or whatever right
it will normally show up macam kau bila kau tengok story orang kan it will pop up between stories gitu
it's not really macam
I think you got I think you pernah tag me under
like cause it's very macam it's not only unique but then like it's very macam ikut
demand gitu it's kind of cool
I would I would probably suggest uh macam
kau start with a few design abeh kau
macam kau post dulu then whichever is popular
like kau just keep note like take note in your head which one's popular then um kalau
kalau ada um
orang macam minta or whatever
like I guess you can just macam buat macam poll lah on your story whatever then you just ask like
uh kalau kau tak kau tak macam tanya customer kau like apa dorang nak and stuff like that it's hard to gauge and like what if
kau tak ada inspiration you know what I mean like what if tiba-tiba you
then obviously it will be susah what so I think it's important to have like
dia ada following so senang in my opinion no offence lah kalau kau ada the following kan
it's just easier for you to macam jual benda cause kau dah ada following banyak orang dia ada dua puluh K tau
dua puluh ribu sorry dua puluh K on her main account ya so like
I'm sure okay maybe not all of them will watch but maybe like ten K gitu akan tengok apa
ya maybe like half gitu at most I mean at least maybe ten K
dia tak ada lining eh kat dalam
ya some shops do that kat singapore pun ada cause actually I think I got follow
one I don't remember what's her name but dorang
pernah macam promote a few smaller businesses
then macam that's so cute cause like macam you know like support local ya exactly support local gitu
I kind of macam considered cause you know how I like I love to wear macam outerwear again
actually I considering macam belajar macam mana nak buat cause I love
I love outerwear macam gini I I don't know cause like I don't want to make it like so thick
but I love outerwear gini like I love I don't know why but I think I love the baggy look a lot
I stress out about the fact that I have free time abeh
bila aku dah stress out pasal free time until nanti aku cari kerja pula abeh abeh like I never use that free time wisely
actually um kau tahu kan uh I was considering uh apa tu
uh sambung belajar ya
because my parents are quite okay lah I'm very blessed because they quite supportive lah dorang macam
dorang okay kalau aku nak kerja ke nak belajar ke
dorang macam aku punya pasal nak buat apa but
still thinking about it and then one of the things aku realise
because uh aku dah I know aku baru kerja dua jobs but I I guess my parents pun realise macam
aku macam adaptable cause like
whenever aku kerja senang jer adapt to the situation cause it's just kerja what you know what I mean like it's not really
but ya so uh apa aku macam realise
a part of me macam
I realised that kalau kau tahu accounting
course kau tak pernah tu eh
is I don't know why I didn't do well but honestly is quite simple it's just macam
I don't know how to explain kau tahu macam
tak it's not that um
kau pernah dengar the term macam assets liability
all that right ya is basically is basically macam
how do I put this normally businesses ada accounting accountant
so basically uh accountant ni macam keep track of their balances
macam accounts lah apa-apa account bank account ke apa ke like
there will always be balance right then you can see like kau spend on what and stuff like that basically it's meant to
the job is meant to tengok and make sure that the accounts balance cause if there's
something macam off sikit dorang kena track kenapa off and like
why is it off like maybe dia macam
it's either terlebih or terlalu sikit then they must check where it is lah
aku pernah belajar kan I told you right I I think I took it for O level but I never
um bila aku fikir balik
it's not difficult lah it's just that at that time aku tak interested nak belajar tu benda cause like it's
aku aku rasa cikgu aku just dreadful agaknya ah
but ya then like kalau accounting kan actually ada banyak
ada banyak sector cause you can do auditing you can do ah bookkeeping
if you are an accountant kan kau macam
in a way kau boleh jadi your own boss I guess
I don't know I'm that's the way my parents put it lah but kalau kau
ada macam some form of background in accounting senang sikit kau nak
dapat kerja in a way
because I think the the main thing is cause you know how sekarang kan pandemic kan
so like ah kalau kau fikir balik the main
mana-mana pun food ada kan and um
these things are the macam industries that won't be so affected for some reason I don't know why
and what ah but like you know ah apa tu
tak interested untuk tengok> but I always see that one scene pop up the one where she makes that comment lah about that guy
oh aku tak suka ah plot macam gitu
you know like what we said about sustainable fashion kita orang no longer ignorant
so because kita orang no longer ignorant I guess um
dorang just trying to fit into
betul like a proper cause that they doing like
like black character to be extremely loud or whatever just ikut just ikut stereotype you know what I mean
nama dia jason like in the show jason dengan
honestly aku rasa aku rasa macam mana I I know I had a point but then like
pasal kita dah berbual aku macam lost my point ah mm
sekejap eh
aku rasa okay pasal tadi kau berbual pasal yang hijab tu kan
yang firefighter and then the grey's anatomy bodoh lah it's so it's ah it's just
low-key aku rasa is because dorang ada
fascination dengan budak
aku rasa dorang ada I think right it it low-key has something to do with also
I don't want to say it ah but I think aku low-key rasa porn has something to do with it because
it's not a uncommon thing aku rasa lah K is not that I know
I mean honestly aku uh bila aku I honestly feel bad for her cause like
she unintentionally might have contributed to that but also bila kau tengok balik
it's not not budak-budak melayu I think
I think in general lelaki melayu I don't know why not all
guys tend to macam wonder what a woman okay the woman can be completely covered tapi dorang will wonder for some reason I don't know how
will wonder what the woman is wearing underneath then aku macam
like aku tak akan pernah fikir pasal dorang punya
tu tau
kadang-kadang dorang ada dorang punya argument kadang-kadang is
but lelaki pun kena kena rogol pe something like that lelaki pun ya they sometimes bring that up as a point tapi aku macam
but why would you like it's not like okay dorang selalu macam
fikir kita orang tak faham or like
we always fight for just kita orang but like we actually fighting for other people also what
it's not just kita orang fikirkan pasal perempuan jer it's that just so happens
perempuan suffer more
pasal kita perempuan like
ikut biology or whatever but then
some of us aren't exactly build to macam
kecil I um kecil
okay ah aku faham
dorang masih buat cerita macam tu macam uh it's either kahwin kaya ke
kahwin uh apa tu bukan kahwin kaya not only that uh
ah kahwin contract
aku tak tahu aku tahu kenapa dorang tak boleh single
like okay aku low-key rasa kan
kita orang uh sebagai melayu kita orang actually maybe we don't really
actually had okay lah kita ada nafsu tapi macam aku rasa the only reason kita motivated by kita punya nafsu
it's also by cerita-cerita macam gini that like promote kita untuk
macam encourage kita untuk macam apa macam
oh kahwin kahwin sikit-sikit kahwin kahwin kahwin muda
kahwin tua pun ada kadang-kadang cerita merepek sia
uh uh kadang-kadang kadang-kadang problem dia dalam perkahwinan boleh kahwin lagi aku macam
like like the common plots is always macam apa kau tak boleh produce baby ke
pastu kahwin kahwin kenapa kau tak boleh adopt ke apa ke like why
I I aku rasa tak akan achieve
dekat-dekat dulu ah then baru boleh pergi jauh-jauh
ya we go near first then we go further later I think tu sebab sebab airport now only until twenty twenty four baru buka then after that
lagi tiga tahun ah
three years sebab now we at the end of twenty twenty already
singapore bodoh

biasa ah tak ada kerja
tak apa if you nak I masak kan I think dapur tu terbakar terus
cause kan I have a friend uh nama dia amelia
I don't know what she was cooking ah tapi kan dia kasi bila dia kasi family dia makan kan semua kena food poisoning
I don't even know I think wait I think she was baking some sugar cookie entah
I think untuk raya ke pe but then I don't know what she put inside baking soda wait you do put baking soda inside cookies right
okay then I don't know what she put inside that poisoned her entire family but ya selain dari masak is there any other position I can do anything but cooking
I don't mind as long duit halal and it doesn't involve cooking or maths because I'm not good at maths I mean like if simple calculation saya boleh tapi you nak I buat algebra tu semua mampus
okay oh my god thank you so much you know I've gone for so many interviews kan but then semua orang tak nak orang pakai hijab hijab atau melayu like there was this one tuition centre that I applied for they were like happy with my grades tu semua and then dorang dah dorang accept tau and then lepas tu dorang tanya like for my race lah and then like what language I speak tu semua then I was like oh
I malay and then I give him my full name then he was like oh I'm sorry but um the position has been filled so we cannot hire you then I was like bro you just mentioned not too long ago that you wanted to hire me then sekarang mentang-mentang I kata that
I melayu you don't wanna hire me anymore
entah lah and then like there was another company ah err it was an accounting company so I'm from uh I was from a media course then I have a media diploma then I went for this um digital marketing job and the person told me during the interview that I don't have the qualifications but in order to get a job at their company I need to be willing to buka my hijab
kan so I ask lah kenapa nak kena buka hijab and then they were like oh cause they deal with a lot of um western people western clients european people and these people they don't really like working with orang islam
pada diorang kan pemikiran dorang ialah
kita orang jahat so kalau dorang nampak yang company ni ada pekerja islam pakai hijab tu semua kan dorang tak nak work with this company
and then the thing is the thing that upsets me the most is that they paksa the pekerja kat situ untuk buka hijab there's like dua ke tiga pekerja kat situ at first dorang kerja boleh pakai hijab tau then all of a sudden I think new management ke pe ah dorang kena terpaksa buka hijab cause kalau tak dorang kena buang kerja
and then you know ah sekarang tengah COVID nineteen nak cari kerja bukan main susah kan so those few workers had no choice but to buka hijab dorang kesian seh wah aku macam nak sepak jer muka dorang like eh bro what does us wearing a hijab have anything to do with our capabilities or anything my mak kerja dekat company besar okay it's a it's an american company that was bought over by a japanese company
and in this company my mak pakai hijab pun boleh naik pangkat tinggi tau you know and there's ramai orang islam kat situ in fact one of her receptionist just converted to islam
and they are okay with them wearing hijab so what is this small local accounting company so against orang pakai hijab you know I think that's just them being racist
menyampah seh
and it's not just in malaysia that orang islam boleh pakai hijab like there's a lot of countries out there that allows their muslim workers to wear hijab even though I have to admit lah singapore lagi bagus sebab the racism isn't really that obvious here but still though you know my I my uh obek kan she actually works at I don't remember which hospital but then she has to remove her hijab
and she's not even a nurse she's just what is she doing ah uh I think she was doing laundry ya so dude you are doing laundry you don't even have to face the people like the um orang-orang semua pesakit-pesakit so like why do you have to remove the hijab that's so stupid what does have wearing a hijab have anything to do with doing laundry I can wear a hijab and do laundry also
his group was in a different court sedih seh I susah-susah penat-penat belajar squash join squash but then tak sama-sama pun
diana wants to set me up with her boyfriend's friend and her boyfriend I'm sorry to say this okay if you ever meet her don't tell her that I told you this tapi kan boyfriend dia kan tak handsome langsung
ya so her boyfriend is a muka muka bukan perangai perangai dia okay lah like he's okay except for the fact that he procrastinates a lot
like okay I I admit that I'm no saint myself but and I procrastinate a lot a lot tapi kan dia kan okay like there was this one time where his boss gave him this job two weeks ago and then he promised her on like okay first week second week the friday kan on the day that he was supposed to submit to um his work to his boss he promised diana that he was going to go on a date with her
tapi kan you fikir bila dia start dia punya kerja nope the day itself like the day of submission itself
kan and then on that day I I was out lah so I didn't notice diana texting me and then lepas tu bila I check my phone kan diana was like eh babe you free tak nak keluar I tengah bosan ni tengah tunggu my guy and then lepas tu I I cuma layan dia via text sebab cause I tak boleh jumpa dia I tengah kat luar pe and then lepas tu dia pukul dua baru dia datang then the whole time she was calling him and texting him dia tak jawab dia mengamuk dengan diana
kan and then lepas tu dia tak minta maaf tak apa
ya and then lepas tu dia bilang<malay diana kan err eh I tak suka tau you asyik call I tanya I kat mana huh text I spam I nanti I dah habis kerja I bilang you lah you jangan nak spam boleh I tak suka
kan oh my god I was so mengamuk and the fact that he didn't apologise to her like bruh who the hell do you think you are you are not even handsome okay and that's not the worst part okay so he has done that quite a lot of time lah that's not the worst part the worst is that dia tak percaya dengan tuhan
he said that tuhan tak wujud there's no such thing as god
but but the fact that you call yourself a muslim tapi you tak percaya dalam tuhan like why do you even bother calling yourself a muslim
ya like like I respect everyone's belief lah tapi kalau you tak percaya you you tak percaya lah you jangan nak bilang orang lain you don't try to force your belief onto other people
diana dia bukannya halal sangat
tapi pun dia tetap percaya dalam tuhan you jangan nak shake her beliefs tau huh you jangan nak bilang dia tuhan tak wujud tu semua it's up to her what she want to believe in
siapa dia nak sembah kalau dia nak sembah tuhan syukur alhamdulillah bagus lah untuk dia you jangan nak marah-marah dia jangan nak tengking dia kena percaya dalam tuhan boleh tak you tak suka you cari perempuan lain ah
the lelaki is he's a medic so I don't mind medics lah
makes me sound like some narcissistic but anyway I bilang dia ah I bilang dorang yang oh err maaf ah tapi I'm sure your friend is a great guy tapi I don't think kita jodoh and then lepas tu I kata but then if you nak kita jadi kawan I tak kisah
so you you nak I cakap dengan dia okay but you need to make sure that he understands that it's only as kawan nothing more nothing less kawan saja okay then dia okay okay then lepas tu I kata okay I don't him to have my number I don't want him to have my social media account I don't want him to know anything about me unless I believe that you know we can be friends tu semua lah we can click as friends
right I don't even wah he called me golden child I was like so lost like is that is that supposed to be a reference to anything like I'm sorry I watch anime but I don't really watch other shows like what what is golden child even and then lepas tu dia kata uh he he started going on about how so um our friends decided to matchmake us cause they believe we're perfect for each other then I'm like bruh
I told them that it is never going to work out between us as anything more than as friends so you jangan nak fikir-fikir jauh-jauh boleh tak he really believe that kita perfect for each other tau
this isn't really a matchmaking event or anything so like you tak suka you tak suka lah boleh belah like in a more polite way okay then he just screenshot my reply he sent it to my friend and her boyfriend then they they were like scolding me like eh why are you sending him such a formal reply you know you sepatutnya cakap gini-gini you jangan nak cakap gitu boleh tak huh
kesian tau dia then I was like kesian dia I your kawan untuk lebih dari tujuh tahun okay you tak kesiankan I
kan and then she was trying to sell him to me like oh he has a ducati he has a lot of motor he's a medic he earns a lot like five figure or something then I was like bruh I know lah I I mata duitan juga tapi I tak lah gitu teruk mentang-mentang dia kaya you fikir I akan apa stead dengan dia
I ada standard
kalau dia apa kacak sikit eh I don't mind lah and then lepas tu kalau personality dia okay I don't mind but the thing is he just broke up with his chinese girlfriend of like I don't know how many years they were like going they were like super steady for so long they were going to get married tu semua but then um the girl's parents tak tak suka cause um dia islam perempuan tu christian ke pe
ya so they just broke up then then it's like what am I a rebound you are not even that good looking bro just find someone else I'm sorry man ya and then lepas tu sampai sekarang diana keeps on saying that oh she wants to set us up then next time kita hang out together kan dia nak bawa lelaki tu nama dia rudy
nama pun old-fashioned
eww mad ah bro I don't even like the name sorry wah fuck I found I sound so kurang ajar seh no but serious that's I don't know like I just feel like he's not my type like we can never click there's no chemistry between us like seriously who starts up a convo by calling the girl golden child
dia fikir kan we were being match made tau so he's really into the idea like he told um diana's boyfriend and diana told me that he's really up for being match made with me kan that's that's how I reacted like like what with first of all I've never even met diana's boyfriend okay second of all we've never met each other I I deleted telegram
after he sent me that message and then I replied to him I deleted telegram so um I don't know if he sent me any messages lah I haven't re-downloaded it and I don't think I will anytime soon and then lepas tu kan um so diana kata err oh I have like my standard tinggi sangat lah I tak boleh pilih-pilih sangat tu semua so she's giving by the end of the month she knows where I live by the way
I'm segan too but I would rather be match made with a guy who is at least like who have something in common with me than with this guy you understand why when I send you his picture
tak boleh seh seriously do you know any guy like it doesn't have to be we don't have to be anything more than friends but I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend all my friends all my guy friends are in and they are either taken or seriously weird
I know lah but I betul-betul tak nak seh dengan lelaki ni and I I don't know who else I can go to to ask for like eh you know any guy friends who can like help me out pretend to be my boyfriend for a while cause oh my god everytime I meet her every dude
um apparently um she's meeting up with her boyfriend tomorrow and she said that her boyfriend is going to bring his friend so she felt segan to go along with him because she doesn't know any of his friends but I know for sure that that is code for she's bringing that rudy guy along
cause she'll know that eh tak kan hari-hari ada family matter seh
you know sekarang kan nak masuk masjid you kena macam register dulu tu semua and then satu kali nak masuk cuma berapa sepuluh orang
ya so nope I think I'm just going to stay home but I do need to find a guy ASAP do you think your kakak knows anyone
so ya and then um we there was this one group project where the teachers group us up and then she was in my group so I was sleeping over in school and then after that she kept on touching me and hugging me and wah and then we had a sleepover in school cause to finish our project kan then lepas tu dia asyik macam pegang-pegang dengan I
then like then then like geli seh
she just pindah to like a few blocks away from me in year two and that was when she started um suka I
kan and setiap pagi kan err cause setiap kali I nak gi sekolah I selalu pergi dengan my mak my mak turun kat jurong then I tukar kat jurong pe and then lepas tu kan nanti dalam tau-tau jer selalu I naik I selalu naik kat belakang sekali
like the last door kan second cabin last door then lepas tu I tengok tau
I selalu tak nampak dia tau-tau je pintu dah tutup pusing-pusing tak ada orang dia dekat belakang I
I usually berdiri dekat pintu yang you know pintu yang selalu tak buka
ya I I duduk kat I selalu berdiri kat situ tau I tak nampak dia<malay tau tau-tau dia akan appear dia akan kata
so so I told her that err indirectly like oh um you know um I have a crush cause at that time I was I had a crush on this guy we called him camera guy but I think I can tell you his name ah cause different school pe nama dia
ya but he was err he was in my academic school we were from together and then lepas tu kan um dia selalu macam everytime there's an event he's like the photographer ah so my friends and I will call him camera guy so that people won't know that we're talking about him
ya and then lepas tu that err I keep on telling the girl who like me like oh you know I saw camera guy again today and then he's so hot tu semua then like I would always purposely mention him whenever she tries to like make a move on me
so at the end of it kita semua marah dia ah
then lepas tu dia tak suka I lagi
ya and then there was another girl who like me also and then um that girl was a bit weird lah because she was telling me about how she was asexual and all that then all of a sudden dia kata oh but you know I wouldn't mind dating you
basically it's like I don't really know how to explain it but it's like social innovation tu semua
ya so um we doing gen ed we would combine classes with other courses tu semua so there was this one girl she was from design and ya she was from design school I forgot which design school she was from um she we we went camping together like it was a school camp lah school trip then she was in my group and she was my roommate for the entire trip it was a week long
ya I I I just I just smile and say oh okay sure err I'm just going to do my work over there but you can go on and shower and then and then lepas tu kan so um she's usually not in the room lah like um she she met this she met this uh guy from we were sleeping in a dorm it was a collaboration with a an indonesian uni
my friends and I we will like sometimes we would just sit on her bed cause it was the closest to the door so we will just sit on her bed like all of our beds lah and then some people would just sit on her bed and then usually like we will like macam basah gitu tau dia nya tilam dia you know what she was doing right
at first we didn't know either because we thought okay maybe like dia habis mandi dia tak lap badan dia betul-betul so dia duduk abeh basah and then lepas tu<malay last day kan bila kita dah nak balik then she just told us oh you know the reason why it's always wet then we're like why kenapa you kena bilang kita like at least okay you bilang kita at the end of the trip but but why kenapa tak bilang kita at start atau you tak bilang kita langsung
I did not need to know what I touched I oh my god and then kan the whole trip she would comment on my badan tu semua tau like oh um
apa cause um she's very open her boyfriend is also super open
she said um if if she's ever like uh if she ever wants to do a threesome dia nak panggil I then I was like okay you ada nombor I and then lepas tu lepas tu I tak contact dia lagi
kan and you fikir it was a one week trip okay or was it two weeks it was almost two weeks actually mak mak I I I tak tahu nak nak happy sebab orang ingat I cantik atau geli sebab I terpegang benda tu atau oh my god I don't even know what to feel man
you ada you ada gambar dia
so err he confessed to me in it was in june holiday I don't remember which part of june holiday and then lepas tu kan uh he he suddenly texted me one four three then I was like one four three apa benda seh so I look it up online lah like I I didn't reply I was like looking up what is one four three then apparently it was like this um
so it means I love you and then I was like oh hell no bish like first of all I felt nothing for him second of all I I was in this um it wasn't really a relationship but our I had this thing going on with primary school friend lah nama dia irfan
so I just muted him lah like oh I'm really sorry bro but I tak suka you so maybe you should just you know move on lah but kita lagi boleh kawan and then he was like okay then he stopped texting me then you know what he did
he spam zi qing asking me to like asking her to get me to accept him tu semua and then it was like I don't know how many days he did that but then zi qing menyampah so she she she like scolded me lah like eh can you tell ateeb to shut up or not ah you know he keep on texting me and spamming me non-stop huh asking me to like get you to get together with him then like oh my god I don't even like him then because of that
uh kitanya clique broke up ah
so so everytime he ask me out like it was to buy stuff for zi qing or like to plan a date with zi qing then I was like bro what am I you know you ask me out you bring my hopes up and then like all for her you might as well just wah fuck I got friendzone so hard so many times man and then ateeb tak give up so apparently kan did you know this apparently ateeb spread a rumour and like a lot of people believed that I was dating ateeb
okay never mind apparently he he spread it to his friends ah so like the guys tu semua
so so I was like huh since when then tala kata apa oh ateeb kata we've been dating since sec two ke sec one then I was like bro I have never liked him that way I never accepted to be his girlfriend I never said yes to him or anything
menyampah seh and then um after that we go off contact ah then in sec err year one poly he texted me uh
begging me for forgiveness then I was like okay you know what we're in poly now so I should be the bigger person and maafkan dia you know matang tu semua
so I kata okay lah I forgive you then kita jadi kawan but then we didn't really text a lot and then you know what happen
kan wait don't tell him that that's why he's like he has a inferiority complex against his abang but anyways then I told him like oh um sorry ah but my friend um I just made up a white lie like oh my friend's already dating someone so she's not interested in you or like in dating anyone else and they will I felt like they will be together for a long time cause like they are they are very um into each other tu semua then I I thought he gave up tau
then err I got angry lah so I scolded him like eh why the hell did you do that sia huh why did you even spam her and all that you know she don't like you right huh you want someone you go find someone yourself lah go on tinder go on okcupid or anything you want to go and harass my friends right menyampah seh
and then lepas tu um he asked me out then I said no obviously like I have never accepted you before what makes you think that I would accept you now you can't even do one push-up properly you dude angin tiup kau pun terbang

you nak you nak I jawab sangat kan ah bayar aku seratus dollar dulu but then I rasa macam mak I kalau dia nya family dia dapat tahu abeh dorang buat police report mampus aku
so I was like okay lah takpe<malay> lah nak duit pun takde lah aku aku desperate sangat

sedih<malay> seh we wah we could have something on damn it but ya I don't know man sedih
hais okay lah um it's been one hour lah so kita end sekarang
ya okay let's start with the questions okay so kalau you ada three wishes um what would you want or ya apa you nak
oh is it so so you mean be visible then boleh macam pergi lelaki punya toilet
oh ya ya ya ya okay so your first wish is actually to have a superpower like jadi invisible
ah okay okay so your first wish is to have a superpower then err your second wish actually nak banyak duit lah kaya
oh ah okay okay can can one superpower and lagi satu is nak what you just wanna be like rich begitu or you you you you want to
ten ten K only you have one freaking wish and err ya apa yang kamu tanya is setakat ten K jer ten thousand
like eh I I bet like other people oh I have a wish okay lah aku nak um one one million but but kalau one million macam sikit sangat ah um maybe I want um
I nak err satu satu juta satu juta is it uh one billion I don't know
where no you must answer the last that the third wish you you nak kena answer the the ya
nombor tiga belum jawab ah
ah oh ya you you cuma minta um jadi err invisible tak ada orang boleh nampak then you setakat minta err
you wanna you you wanna have like err sepuluh ribu jer
the ya jadi nombor tiga
only without err only without sucking blood lah jadi err so tak hisap darah ah tak apa kira macam err friendly vampire lah kan
your wish your hajat hajat is untuk dua is superpower
then lagi satu is okay lah a a genuine err general wish ah
ah hajat yang tepat lah kan
goblin apa pula goblin what's
what right um apa ya uh um
I think um tengok cerita-cerita macam psychological thriller err those err political err zaman dulu-dulu punya like you know the olden days
then err also macam bunuh-bunuh orang punya like those murder kind of scenes

and pass down to the generation also lah macam maybe ha
um maybe dalam
apa ya
what is uh million in malay ribu err juta err
juta then ribu is billion
ribu thousand juta is million then billion
billion you don't know juta ah okay so dalam
beberapa juta sia
okay lah then like that kalau nak safe
safe to say err dalam seratus seratus juta
seratus juta also equivalent to one billion right
ya seratus juta I think that seems fine like um because you see ah um
ya I mean so untuk to be safe lah you you don't wanna make your next wish macam
eh genie err boleh tak minta um lagi satu err macam err add on wish begitu I I aku tak nak pakai wish nombor dua kau macam nak um ya just uh add on to my first wish
so I think uh ya just to be safe ah seratus juta lah
second apa ah

err saya nak jadi bahagia dengan
err ada banyak kawan bahagia dengan err ada banyak-banyak kawan
which is apa tu trustworthy keep them loyal lah not not just what err want to be friends with me for err my money because now I'm rich right a billionaire ah

penat penat seh asyik kau kerja
bila kau start kerja baru ini fourteen december berapa minggu jer
excited the place is near your house kenapa tak mana kerja aku cause di sini sia ada macam some kind of progression
kau dah buat berapa lama di tempat ini wow that's fast ah
so moving back into like your um cakap siapa tadi
bila dia orang boleh masuk singapore
apa tu barang fashion ke barang household rumah ke barang fashion jenama fashion orang keluar masuk kedai kenapa apa seh
orang beli bag warna-warna buat apa
so I was I was sleeping and thinking about it and guess what when I was half asleep I paid for that freaking app that was so bodoh of me it was a yearly subscription of sixty something I'm so pissed at myself for like the I paid for it so why would I want to cancel it correct
that was so bodoh of me
later you help me out tolong aku I seriously feel so bodoh realising I bought an app when I was half asleep
really really except for those who are working shifts and dekat the
finally after so long of working shifts penat seh kerja shift
bagus berharap kau boleh stay kat this job lama I find that
I noticed that your previous job I mean you worked well but just that the company closed down ke apa ke and it's always like unexpected suddenly
dia cakap besok semua try to avoid going to town in taxi all that is going to be packed eh I thought people stop to go to retail shop to buy stuff
but I think my weakness is makan asyik pergi makan jer as much as nak buat melipat kan macam need to plan for the week
I think the intake is only for like ten days worth ah I think kena makan for like tiga bulan atau empat bulan untuk the
fifty dollars for the um the therapy and then thirty dollars for the yoga therapy so the poses the yoga poses that they taught me was more for menses punya routine to relieve menses tu
I think I will show you later later I forget and then for treatments lah this thing because my next appointment is in january which is like what lagi dua bulan
but but dia cakap kalau boleh makan more sayur-sayur but sayur pun kalau bagus like asparagus don't eat mushroom I don't know I know right I have been eating mushroom cause I thought they was the easier to eat
and then like avoid potatoes but sweet potatoes is okay no milk I mean I'm lactose intolerant no spicy food pedas-pedas tak boleh you know I feel like your body tell you already what you can or you cannot accept right so we will all along I know that I cannot eat pedas punya makanan because I will just go to the toilet
to shit yes of course yes that and then I will go to toilet susu pun sama but apparently one I think a few years ago at my business partner house lah we all cook this interesting dish lah so it tasted like those kung pao chicken so instead of using santan the coconut milk we use greek yoghurt
so it felt like and then the spices that they use macam make up for it macam it looks like yes something like that but I think it's like purely indian food interesting
actually kan I've been wanting to eat more plant based because it's good for us yes I mean yes for my dad yes the kidney issues and then the diabetic I mean I read some articles where people go plant based um their kidney macam feel better one of it is a friend of mine uncle dia kan macam quite a high stage diabetic lah then he had to err inject insulin
inject insulin everyday and then when he changed the diet to like plant based within the next six months he didn't need he don't need the insulin anymore so it's like our body got a lot of like macam too much meat from then
so I've been wanting to eat more plant based just that cara nak masak pula because we are so used to like masakan melayu masakan wastern yes rice is a staple but there are other form of carbs what other vegetable have all have carbs fruits also have carbs is just a matter of taking which one and some buah-buahan
too manis yes but some buah got higher natural sugar in it I can't remember need to refer to the list
nasi I makan nasi basmati so
penat because kerja satu hari bangun pukul tujuh lebih pukul enam lebih keluar rumah pukul lapan mana tak lambat three thirty ah menahan menahan taxi
I was stuck at home apa tu actually aku aku mahu see yang tu juga mm mmhmm
I know right you always take the bus early or late oh earlier lama dia then what did you do take train
creamy meatball are there any other sayur inside your bowl
wow mana ada ini oh I don't remember adding the ice cream
yes but I don't like the place ah I don't like the inside ah so busuk cause I sat near the kitchen so sempit
benda leceh saya nak buat actually
buat basic cause meal prep can be interesting if you know how to do it well
nak perlu impact oh habis kau tak pernah pergi rumah dia
kan lepas tu dia cakap macam kind of um okay no
masa itu masa itu emas time is golden
she ask me that you haven't kahwin that time I thought you kahwin already then she ask kat apa
she say that time I fall down only I kahwin next year aku kau
want to be what dia cakap
who's that siapa tanya
you have to plan lah all the content but there are some influencers right when they post something ah you are so convinced to buy the item wah the person say bagus ah this one okay ah I try also
maybe they are selective lah yes yang macam cakap boleh bagus
but I think nowadays if you want to do your own side business food is always the easiest people like to pay for food makan sedap jer then what about those like unhealthy
I don't know what to eat tomorrow for lunch asyik-asyik makan sandwiches but the one from seven eleven stew apa I mean it must be strong in kimchi flavour
kenyang tak why you heat it up a warm meal then how does it taste like when it's warm really
it wasn't that bad but okay lah yes ramen spot is the best like kat mana opposite lau pa sat kasih area gyudon
poke bowl I don't know salmon what did you eat at lau pa sat yang dekat lau pa sat itu is it like the soy based or the miso based or
I saw that I saw the person macam mana dia apa sushi cake eh the salmon cake savoury cake savoury sushi cake yes is like a decorated cake but it's like all salmon mentaiko all savoury I feel we should have that for our next birthday
it's filling ah kenyang ah
pucailok the long bean with like asam I don't like the corn just the long bean and you eat it with the you know scrambled egg like the side nasi you how about you
um fifty betul
so maknanya kalau uh kalau if you yang in ten years time memang you want to be in an area yang ada laut yang ada greenery where
kalau untuk saya for me eh I think eh
I would like to live in my own lab atau garage
and maybe sebelah would be my like lab apparatus ke apa ke
so if I have my own lab I would probably uh maybe add a telescope atau like some meeting devices so that I can
mmhmm betul
katanya if say let's say you were
martial arts gitu
uh any political issues ya so I think it's very stimulating for me and um I think it it it gives me like macam
yang satu orang ni uh she was actually uh she was actually trapped in a spaceship
computed her body into into a technological uh into a computer-generated programme so meaning her colleagues and herself were actually in a spaceship and they have no control of returning or whatsoever because their was generated fun fact it was actually their clone ah orang sendiri tau so
so the boss memang memang jahat ah gilanya orang
like their their image you know what I mean faham tak ya so an image of them self you mean nak ah macam
ah ada fit body atau good looks
I think I agree on that lah sebab kalau kalau sekiranya macam ada wajah yang cantik pun eh tapi kalau macam if you can't like run
ten miles when you don't have the stamina or the health then buat apa lah
ya so I think for me kalau ada fit body is more satisfying sebab
for health is technically is more is the is the most important thing for you to live in this in this world lah sebab without without health actually um you can be bedridden and even the the cost of uh
so macam I think health is very important lah sebab without health memang you tak boleh buat much lah you can't do much actually
kena start awal lah
so I think one kalau pot from having a fit body eh
like all you said a healthy body I think it's also important to have a healthy mind sebab sekarang memang as you can see eh mental health is very prevalent especially among the youth err among the working adults and among um teens
cara holistic lah
I think mental health also like uh stems from other external factors macam maybe overwhelming of
school work atau
probably they cannot handle the stress that they have lah that they experience so um like if you can see like the education system kat singapore sekarang memang very uh
it's very intense lah so like what macam
for for me because I've I've I've been in the education system and macam memang I've been schooling ah and I think macam there's a lot of
but tu memang
but it doesn't really appease them so I think macam apparently the education system has been the same for more than hundred years but uh everything has been changing and revolutionised
uh it gives not only education to students or to everyone but it helps them to learn or or you train their mind on how to learn not what to learn because I feel that every every single time my friends when they enter school when they enter when they when they take test they actually memorise everything and I think that's very futile it's pointless sebab apa tau if you memorise everything
then we won't learn anything we're just spitting out whatever you learn or and you macam just just kasi semua on paper but you don't actually learn or having or you don't even get the gist of it like for example even in exams they ask you
macam apparently to some students maybe it maybe it just stimulate their practical thinking but what students don't like chemistry or physics lah and ya I think I don't don't think they will find the benefit in learning that or applying that in life so maybe it's a it's a good discussion bila macam
macam susah lah kan
mm okay so contohnya like for now eh we are in the twentieth twenty first century
cuba like for example eh you ternampak a time capsule
I think that's pun what I would really macam really cherish enjoy
I don't know maybe zaman rasulullah atau dark ages ah cause um basically the dark ages were macam a period of time
the macam
rolab and I think those were the ages where where there were a lot of inventions like you know the sultans of science bila there's this two brothers
I think it's very interesting to see macam
the the progression during that period of times sebab sebab during that time memang memang tak ramai orang ada tak ramai orang dapat keluarkan idea macam gitu
during the golden age and I find it really interesting sebab how their mind
even in engineering and science and uh it can do like a lot of things at once and I think that's something that's um macam kita jarang tengok ah
dalam dunia ni sekarang tau most of the time kan kadang-kadang macam contohnya eh I have to um contohnya I have to pursue the road after my O levels just for engineering will it set where I want to go maybe not but I like to pursue maybe engineering medicine uh philosophy literature of course I like to learn a lot of things at once lah but I think macam ya I think it'll be very interesting lah kalau you can like learn
tak sampai mana-mana macam ilmu ni bukan terak laginya luas kalau kita dapat ilmu tu kita just go far
sebab ilmu tu mana-mana and you can use for ilmu ilmu ilmu payah ke ilmu
ilmu apa tu pengetahuan ke apa as long as kita ada ilmu kita gunakan dengan baik and I think it will be very fruitful lah
um duit ke rumah ke
or war actually can be stopped cause technically um itu lah kalau boleh share but technically like uh world hunger among there are many um palestinians
hunger itself is very it's hard to address because poverty is it might be out of reach to most of us and especially during this COVID eh macam susah seh orang nak macam macam nak dicakap ada sebab memang now orang eh actually tengah kelaparan yang kadang tak ada kerja yang tak ada no access to macam
so I think um having a family really macam
and kalau ada suami I would be able to
find solace in him cause memang allah turunkan kita dalam pasangan kan so I think having a spouse would be very interesting lah
akhlak yang baik lah
macam I can feel you lah I think having uh having status
even if you want me to have good akhlak
tak ada gunanya kalau kita ada akal okay kita tak
hancur tau
akhlak is more valuable lah than intellect
akhlak lah actually even if you have your own
buat yang baik lah
you tak ada gunanya
maybe like um what do you think if you macam kiranya kalau kita ada macam superpower
kalau you ada superpower like you nak jadi apa kalau what what what will you like to have right now
kalau ada barang nak kemas inshallah lah
kalau you know I rasa
sebab kalau I dapat teleport kan
I takkan lambatnya cause I'm like always late kalau dapat teleport then macam on on the speed of light or even faster than that uh just like be wherever I want to be just teleport tak tak payah nak passport semua so I think that's very cool ah kalau kalau kalau dapat teleport lah
I think the current technology memang tak boleh lah unless kita ada transporter macam kat star trek ke but of course not lah
tapi contohnya eh kalau macam now's the kalau cause sekarang memang is in progress lah what what do you think of
phones pun is a machine so that's the that's functions in it
sekarang google jer
I think okay lah maybe salah saya juga sebab phone tu memang it serves like an educational purpose lah
ya and the entertainment purpose untuk zaman sekarang
they don't have emotions or they lack like dopamine serotonin in especially in humans humans ada this kind of chemicals
you can react to certain things tapi macam they are programmed to do these things and then what happens are like programmed to weaponise or kill people I think that will be very scary in the future where yeah it's very scary hopefully can be used for good
cause it's very um like in the future it's very unknown but in a sense that you think I think agaknya also I feel it's on the good side lah because
important I think apart from that I think macam humans should actually still take care of their parents and macam don't just leave them do it by themselves because technically humans we need to feel interaction and contohnya macam
uh like a like a constructor or telecomm imagine they cannot address questions then macam mana seh kan
ada limit to it
I think one dia macam pun very subjective lah sebab kita orang tak tahu like in the future what is the government's plan what are the engineers' plan
I think ya technically macam you can see like the the human population of the world is can be overpopulated and also at some
some regions in the world macam india they are very overpopulated kalau kita dah ada robot lagi mana nak letak seh human ni so apart from like apart from like moving to mars or europa I think will be very difficult lah sebab you have to find a contingency plan sebab memang dunia ni maybe won't be enough for the for the rest of the human beings and to house robots so maybe very interesting lah to actually to predict and cause nowadays memang
humans dorang betul-betul kena
but I think I understand right I think would be good to counter people for example people who likes to kill or like or or who likes to start war for even even macam greedy greedy people who are in like in charge of companies if can actually take charge of
can take can take charge of a certain organisation or and if they have the capacity to do that maybe even even a better capacity than a human being I think it'll be very interesting to see lah sebab um some people like humans like if we if we discuss we have emotions have impulses we have intentions but for they don't have that they can only follow whatever you they are programmed to do so probably the risk of making mistakes will be lesser

I mean kalau pergi mana-mana
I tak cerita sebanyak kalau nak pergi mana tapi yang penting err
if I were to go travel I I got a plan like I mean not so plan but if like if anybody got any suggestion eh why not we go to this place pergi tempat ni lah macam best jer ah I just ikut jer ah you punya orang kita lah how about you
and winter will be interesting because tak pernah experience salji macam salji mesti lah sejuk kan tapi from what I know ah
tengok pokok-pokok ah pokok lupa nama dia tapi it's pink in colour merah jambu pokok tu tengok macam dekat bila kita jalan ambil gambar pun cantik apa kan so cantik jer pokok tu I think I like pretty stuff lah I mean who doesn't like pretty stuff like when you take photo it will look good on you so ya
what's the name for the ya so I'll bring them to kampung glam because of I remember masa time dulu ah sekolah rendah sekolah menengah kan mesti ada field trip like they will bring us to a few places in singapore then we can just enjoy right so I remember going to kampung glam
and masa tu time tu sekolah rendah lah dia orang bawa kita pergi ah
it was very interesting at first sight because ah I mean kita kalau macam mana nak cakap ah kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya culture where where it is what so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main ah macam gasing or chapteh lagi ada five stones there are five stones
so ya I think I am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu lah oh ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam lah macam-macam permainan lah macam permainan dulu-dulu I think I'm
I would not say I grew up watching it lah how how would I explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so I I bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam ah eh tengok ah boys over
flowers best tau cerita dia ah cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then I was like
oh okay mula dengar macam oh okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam eh I want tinggi wah cik lawa ah buat kawan ah kan
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau I'm here for you like you know
macam dalam dunia ni itu kan macam movie ah tu kan based on
non-fiction what so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam wah macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
three hours is because uh they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture what ya when making movies lah but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it ah it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
teletubbies punya patung I mean I tak collect banyak lah I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is ah
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia kan then ah laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan uh dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan uh sotong
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal kan cerita pasal kapal
cinta wah that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting eh yang ini oh I got I got a question for you um if you have three wishes what would you wish for
err terutama saya suka I suka makan I suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan kan I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
uh it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir kan dia macam dia diam jer jadi if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam wah
I can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people lah if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like oh okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind what so
I think I mean like that's part of uh your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil lah you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you lah actually
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai jer ah nak beli baju ni lah ah kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
I mean just bawa balik I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean biasa lah sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli eh nanti guna ke tak tak guna eh tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun I mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok ah any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite lah kan tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran I got a neighbour ah ah my neighbour likes to plant ah
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi eh macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose I don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of uh food what
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek kan macam
kena bahan ini lah bahan itu lah tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard what so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
ah favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre ah sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
err if I were to say well we both like K pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
oh cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu ah you know pop yeh yeh it's the malays well it I always like to bring back to to the old times then like I say my friend see me as like ah throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop yeh yeh is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah eh sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop yeh yeh that was that was the band that I think that was the first I forgot what's the band's name I forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
ah malay band that I listen to at that point of time I think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop yeh yeh ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa lah kan ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu lah they call it pop pop
live music pernah pergi dengan
band ah apa nama band tu westlife
alah boleh lupa pula ah band nama tu ah I pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat uh westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
uh it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert ah this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time I went for concert yang live usually I tak pergi pasal I
ah satu duit kan very ah macam mahal kan tapi like this time round um my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so I was like eh you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
oh ugh my talking about shopping just now right uh fashion style I'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam I suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai T-shirt seluar
err kasut tak kisah lah kasut ke sandal ah tu jer I'm I'm that type of I don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya I rarely wear accessories too but only recently
so you know me you know my collections I just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak ah kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
ya I I don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what I mean right macam you look at wow it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde kan dalam global mesti ada kan so hitam is I think
hitam like is the is the main ah but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about eh ya
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap eh kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar I'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta I mean I
ah faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam wah dia ni kacak ah dia ni macam handsome jer ah tapi tu ah fikir-fikir balik ah kita like would you really
alamak okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking teh O ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya alamak if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh O ice I will pilih teh O ice
I mean syrup syrup manis I mean I teh pun manis lah kan tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting wah
it's just mi apa noodle
kalau sound uh
actually any sound tu I takde idea tapi macam if you were to ask me if ah I tak pergi where what is ah my favourite place to go I will pick uh
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers bunga basically like I said lah bunga cantik like I really really really
you know my favourite ah bunga matahari bunga matahari is my kesukaan bunga matahari tu lah macam every time I tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia
the colour dia colour macam cerah kan colour kuning kan dia macam what ah it it will lift up your mood
to to plant and to jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga rose tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena ah selalu
kasi dia air so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well lah from what I know rose but if I would would want to plant it's like I say
bunga matahari I nak tanam pokok bunga matahari ya
plants and looking at ah flowers bloom bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak eh
pokok eh bunga cantiknya
ah it will make us macam it will make

ya tak
ya tak perasan lah
bila nak snow eh
bila nak snow ah
panas sia
so right now you still cari kerja lah
so right now you still cari kerja lah
oh okay lah uh right now pun I feel that
ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this um
I pun ada apply I pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like oh you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam um
tak ada hal panggil hal ah
right now pun aiya susah lah as long as I feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil jer lah eh
ya lah tengok condition dia lah you know some people they just
so kalau pay is not good
oh kerja apa tu
cause I applied for teaching macam english you know languages lah basically
ah macam tak faham ah I just
tapi ya ya papaya lah you know just
leceh lah it's just part of the routine right sekarang
ya lah it's always like that lah the management sometimes when you tak when you don't have a good management right
wait she say like that she say like word for word gitu
she say like word for word macam gitu
was minta kena sepak sia
ah dah burn ah tak payah lah
apa tu right now pun macam susah ah kalau nak
either work from home or face to face ah I preferred tapi
also depending lah like cause I'm doing project right like I said then macam
projects so basically uh kalau ada apa apa
ya ya you know the kalau
macam ugh malas ah it's better to do face to face ah you know like lincah can just
whatever lah right now pun
so ya I know kat sini quite bising
um right now kat sini ada renovation my area sini
it's a bit suffocating kalau you stay at home work from home
rimas ah
but I think kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam
go the proper way kena ada majlis perkahwinan
that one that one I don't know sia I don't know I don't actually know how it works kalau your partner is a non-muslim
I tak tahu seh ada benda macam gini
no I don't tak tak ingat pun you ada cakap
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents kalau your parents ada pressure you
your parents ada pressure you
kan kalau you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
so I I tend to neglect kalau ada
get the wedding cause some people they get married first kahwin dulu ah then
ya I just nak keluar rumah you know have your own
he cannot really move into my place also because I think kecoh ah
I think kecoh ah
I don't prefer kecoh
which kecoh no not that kecoh
uh it's cramped kecoh
my brother pun nak kahwin kan end of december I I hope
cause like kecoh
the house is just cramped ah sekarang my house ada enam orang
is those it's not even petty crime it's just weird crime macam
bawa passport
kena bawa passport
actually ya pretty I think because jurong my area jurong west kan uh banyak
some more there's not much um my area there is just macam industrial there's not much activity going around
it's quite scary lah kalau balik malam-malam then
ya then ada juga uh pencuri which is
then I jalan balik
I told my parents ah then my parents macam cause my parents are in the
ya my parents on gila lah you know they are all in all these
eh seram pe
it's always like that you always get kerja somewhere far away from your house
my office work my main office is at town what so I'm like ah malas
malas the crowd no
my office situ is like
so I uh it's crowded lah especially kalau in the morning kan nak ambil public transport
fact that you feel like seram ah especially if you go home late at night
you you can you can stay at jurong east if I'm not wrong jurong east ada
ya certain areas macam um
you know uh malls or ke apa
like I I also had the same mentality as you macam um
wait so right now dia
dia just kerja ah I mean sorry dia just sekolah lah
wah kecoh
oh but then that semester break is I think is just macam cari
you know bulanan
oh sekolah uni
no belum
okay ah biasa jer how about you
oh banyaknya
so um we actually met at bugis so then we went to walk around at bugis junction first because we want cause uh we want cause we met late afternoon so we decided to not we decided he ajak me go solat at masjid sultan
so we went to walk around first then around me six fifty then we made our way to masjid sultan then you know now got the safe entry staff so we cannot really um masuk early kan so we had to waste our time first before we go to masjid then
then um like a few days later like he had a bad he got bad news that his friend meninggal
ya that's one thing like okay I'll give him space cause like you know orang tu baru meninggal kan
aku tak expect kau to be like
I always confront him when like I feel that it's too much or something I always confront and I always tell him macam
like at that point in time aku tak cakap apa-apa cause
honestly that last conversation kan he dia minta maaf cause um dia tahu yang apa macam
he he knows he's in the wrong ah kirakan then he apologize then I was like okay since you apologize you brought up the matter yourself pe so I included my own thoughts about that matter ah
over that maybe my words or something I don't know lah but it's just like macam I feel like he could have
if kalau dia datang balik kan
I don't know kalau jodoh jodoh
it's not fair or tak boleh ah macam what the what the hell is this but at that point in time I wanted to confront him about him not talking to me but at the same time I'm like but he's mourning his friend so I gave him the space but I occasionally check up on him so
yes ya and also macam
when I think bila fikir balik kan
um datang balik pun
if really then I'll give in ah but if not then malas ah
philosopher tak menjadi
yang online friend tu kan
wait wait wait where is he from dia dari mana
is neil the one that it's like the best friend of the one that you ask me tu
so jadi
sekarang kau tak berbual dengan dia ah
I kau ingat sampah
ya that's the first one which was like in april bila aku masih berbual dengan lelaki lagi satu tu
dia masih chat aku lagi
how dah tak boleh balik kan cause
dia masih sekolah kat china kan
any feelings for him again right it's just like macam why why do you want to talk to me like I thought you went back to your ex that she don't like
aku fikir dia fikir macam kita kawan jer kot
why is it taking way longer than when I date with sampah sampah was like
yang lelaki yang kau message kat imessage tu tak berbual lagi
kau babitkan aku though
I want to get back to the online punya
bro I just aku cuma nak kawan I don't want sex
got there was once I met a nice guy and he okay and he's muslim then abeh dia cakap why are you here then I was like why can't I be here like he was trying to be like you know macam mak bapak gitu like why are you here
administrator punya
then I had to angkat the boxes up to the sink
like macam aku fikir
in dalam kepala aku kan aku macam
aku tak akan baik cause
but eh sampai mak aku risau seh mak aku was like
jangan lah nangis
like I asked my mother urut also
tak hilang so I was just like
I don't know how to explain it it's just macam
aku dah cakap jangan pegang kau pergi pegang then I was like
the previous day punya bread
macam boxes of it
sedap cause
kiosk is the macam mcdonald's tu
mcdonald's yang kau order kat depan tu abeh dia picit picit yang itu ah
in front of the masjid
depan um
then you take to kembangan station then you have to walk to masjid then cross
but the restaurant okay the restaurant is okay but makanan dia sedap
paling pendek is
so nak kerja susah sikit
okay tapi kalau kerja sana kan
kurang ajar sia
I mop everything sapu
sapu the outside and inside the office also
what the heck and they went home already and then the kitchen was dark then I was like takkan nak biarkan ni kat sini nanti
and wash it and then the tempat
cuci pinggan is at the back near the back door then the back door
naik motor woo
then now pakai mask kan
I'm not blaming aku tak blame lecturer ah but
punya course kan
kau punya lesson plans macam mana
I would aku betul-betul tak berbual dengan orang dari kita punya sekolah
dia dia boys
I don't know eh dia
but I don't know aku tak tahu kenapa dia orang stop
dia macam what
get a get a real job yes ha susah sia nak cari kerja sekarang
err I ya lah but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me uh pasal my wish is my need ah right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish ah to something else I tak tahu apa ah
dia orang cakap by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb err
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know oh my god I don't know how we gonna do it lah but ah I rasa dia punya
dia punya the struggle is gonna be real lah like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless kita hop on trends or unless
we have quality content lah but I think we have quality content eh I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that err getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I rasa itu paling susah lah sia
I think you are confusing streaming dengan video kita memang buat video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the err console to record the whole the whole the whole session
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing ah so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play lah because I don't think people wanna do that yet kita kita not at that level lah nor we want to venture there pasal kita I think
streamers orang they are like deejays they are like radio deejays dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak inside jokes ah where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff lah but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality ah ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
so people will be interested lah I I I baca dekat dalam dekat youtube dia orang cakap if you want to start something like this ah you have to be you have to know what you are
uh like you are trying to focus on ah macam
macm kita kita nak kena main this specific game jer tau because what people want is people want
this content from you jer so you macam the speciality ah so ya macam they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a macam a doctor advising sickness what that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy kita nak kena like specialise in this one game jer and then like a random kadang-kadang kita we see if we can selit one or two games inside
apa like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game lah ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I rasa challenging sia
tak ah of course not man
kita punya tak begitu sia I I make sure the content that we kita push out semua quality sia I mean it it should provoke a feeling lah and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness err like you kalau ketawa I think that's that's quite good already ah where we ini kerja keras like a no brainer you just tengok habis doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad lah pasal kita edit susah payah kerja keras sia ni
oh the live stream one memang tak ada apa-apa like only live stream one is really moments lor the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
settle sia I dah belikan safwan dah
err I rasa like fifty err so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya
but this one I got it for cheap lah like dekat Ali Express so that was good
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause err I mean it fits ah I have no complains ah so I assume they the custom made it ah cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself ukur ukur ukur ya
got your help with that ah you ukur kepala ukur shoulder ukur my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I dah belikan safwan tengah on the way safi tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak maybe when he's older a bit
spider gwen ah okay okay ya tengok ah rezeki kalau ada lebih
I rasa nak pakai black cat lah no black cat is a spiderman version of cat woman but he's a black cat no
yes no I don't know I tak pernah where got spider spider cat is cat not a spider I say black cat I never say spider yes
I rasa nanti I minta cheese fries ah
tomorrow tomorrow dah call dah kalau tidak
take lah half day bila lagi nak ambil
next two weeks baru christmas
next week ada apa
ya is it bila you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
I accumulate dua puluh hari sia you
I selalu I selalu err selalu like fikir macam like last year punya tu I selalu tak nak habiskan I selalu simpan for the day that I want to leave the company
my plan is always to keep leave so I can macam ni I have to serve notice two months sia you now at least I clear leave I serve like
no lah from dulu sia I macam itu
I selalu tak nak habiskan if I can bring forward I will bring forward
there is no point in I don't know lah to me macam kalau kita tak kalau kita ambil leave to not go on holiday why would you want to take that leave
some more kita tengah work from home kan
bila dia hospitalised eh
because it's not dia tak tu ah dia nak kena kita punya sink kan dia punya bawah tu kan gemuk
IKEA punya is you remove that sink ada pipe theirs is for that pipe jer kita for the whole gemuk punya thingy
there is but it won't be err apa tu macam flush ah
the it's it's like a is a triangle so it's two triangles lah kalau you nak beli is two triangles but because it's not flush because that thing is gemuk dia it will protrude out lah so you won't be flush so you will be like ke depan ah
because kalau buat satu then the other one tak buat then the next time kena buat then is like err what buang masa but I think it's fast kan yang that time your father tukar jamban knock knock knock letak jamban baru macam cepat sia like in less less than a day dah habis sia ya that time remember ya lah he call somebody ah your err abang punya father

I also think macam itu juga ah
kalau for me
um selain McDonald's what's your favourite fast food also
yes ya dia dari uh datang dari filipino
I boleh makan like three piece or five piece of chicken
it's just sedap
tempat dia dekat sana juga ah I think we talking about the same thing
and err ya mostly barang macam
mee goreng combo
because it's near dia dekat dengan botanic garden ah
I always eat dekat Adam's Corner
cause you just need to uh naik bridge
and and you already reach it uh macam dalam five minute
if I go makan there I think
maggi goreng combo and the drinks I think
oh I'm sorry my melayu rabak sikit
so tebu is definitely not bamboo
K K I'm K salah saya
I pergi sana is because
so bila I go there ah
dia kerja dekat suria is it
I tak tengok news

apa cerita you tengok dekat
yes so kadang-kadang my class start at eight
the latest that I arrive paling lambat I think pukul lapan
tapi I will try my best to come school early next time
cuba juga improve my
now I have a lot of projects so tengah nak habiskan semua
lama seh
I think nak apply kerja
susah lah nak cari duit
err bulan depan
apa-apa you cakap tadi ah
dalam masa depan pun I think will continue my studies
apa you join
tak tak tahu kenapa also I join then when I was sec three
my kawan uh all ajak me go
and that's where I grew my interest dengan rugby
I anggap rugby as a
whenever nak pergi training
so bila kaki tu injured
uh kena pergi doctor
so bila
time kecil tu my bicycle
tapi is not your normal bicycle is like
so daripada situ I pick up uh skateboarding also
so I play dengan skateboard together
tak ada break any bones because I want to continue playing
dengan skateboard and also maybe hopefully
kalau boleh lah um play rugby in another ten years
we live our life together sama-sama in dalam satu rumah happily
tapi I hope that phase three is coming soon because tak sabar nak pergi malaysia
tak mahu cakap pasal mask
then when you breathe and there's fog dekat cermin mata
I can't wear contact lens takut
my kawan like
I pun tak sabar nak uh habiskan ini COVID
ya sedih bila dengar Teo Heng is closing down
tapi um if it's not karaoke
I rasa I nak pergi main bola dengan my kawan
oh of course I want to keluar dengan my family
uh ajak dia orang pergi dinner um
you know uh pergi
tak pernah dengar pasal hundred dollar voucher
the hundred dollar voucher tu boleh buat untuk staycation
dah lama plan
ease off my mind off uh jauh dari rumah at least you know
meet somewhere that macam
uh boleh relax my mind
bila I go wild wild wet
kita pergi wild wild wet but actually it's different because
kena lineup time uh the lazy lazy pool
because they only limit ten people dekat dalam you only can go one round
boleh enjoy wild wild wet as per normal
cannot agaknya bring my girlfriend along
um actually tak pernah pergi sana but I hope to try
like just now bila
I cakap I don't like uh I mean I like heights right
I takut
bila dia tengah naik suddenly dia turun
tapi no matter how scary a roller coaster is right
ada ah similar
tapi tak boleh lah because it's illegal
I hope to go malaysia and nak cuba
there's satu specific
that I suka
it's a M three uh I tahu you don't like cars but
ya actually betul juga ah macam
tak tipu actually is one of my favourite
tokyo drift punya cerita uh in all the movies
kalau you percaya there's nine fast and furious movie
seven because after that I don't watch it anymore and it's it's not too realistic so macam dah malas nak tengok
ya macam for me
macam mana I boleh suka bola like
semenjak kecil uh
semua of my family
uh yes ada baby pictures of me wearing a
actually I suka club too because of the history
uh but it's datang from a rival club ah
after like how many years dia orang menang club uh cup
um I'm not being a hater tapi macam I'm glad that they won their first title after how many years
kalau tak nak pergi kerja you can always take tapi kalau dah ambil
uh pergi lah rest dekat rumah
hards hard time has to come first baru
easy life baru datang so don't expect everything to be easy
ya I get what you mean tapi
harap that everything will
and boleh dapat uh boleh dapat kerja senang
kalau boleh everybody at uh live their normal life after that
I hope that good news akan datang
kalau tak we will if orang tak uh
akan datang ah
oh it was so much fun after a long time I tak pergi kerja then went back so met um
um macam in a small group lah instead of last time one big group
group lah but no more number of days dia panjang ah um james was the in charge ah it's quite fun lah
screening right they are prepared awal you know I mean normal
kerja dari rumah more relax they says ah then they say oh then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
tadi tadi one is from um one's from mycrone
if nenek pekik-pekik
because I told bibik to give anxiety pill early
I think nenek is more on anxiety rather than depression ah because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
ah so I guess it's more anxiety than dari depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit termenung thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then uh there is
and she started want to pray then she ah tak yakin that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
not um it's quite to say lah couple of days when she was at the peak um which is really really very I should say macam mana very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
her macam worse or ataupun dia punya um paling tinggi lah dia punya mengamuk atau dementia punya err
so as what you say lah maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like macam quite ah quite more peaceful um
um more macam if she she shouted yell and err
but not much and then err at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming ataupun nak minta keluar from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just redha jer lah ikhlas and redha
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone itu sahaja um from last time she doesn't want to be alone
hantu are not human
she's very garang human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing lah she's very scared the rest I don't think so lah macam people she's not afraid of lah none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
of course lah unless she says like stupid things lah then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans lah merepek jer accounting but cute lah she answer
apa ni merepek nak balik ah which is funny lah
macam gitu lah
what's your name how many children you have lepas tu dia tanya
all the personal things lah then tanya
um past then present then tanya in between so
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up lah so she macam ada rest and then after that continue again um
ya but the progression is like um the progression is actually macam okay lah people
um which macam mana nak cakap eh ah depression lah maybe lah
difficult for me to say lah because it involved brain and then like nenek they said that some of her brains already stroke
educate the caregiver itu lah
because dia orang ni sooner or later they going to be
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say ah eh I thought you want to err pass motion or you want to kencing and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that um
um professional ataupun ah
nurses yang
well educate about all this macam well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is err no the better lah no way I'm quite difficult lah this this this this dementia or old aging punya err problem eh it's going to hit the world
the youngsters educate the youngsters ataupun macam make it a point that
or anak mesti nak kena jaga parents atau there is this centre ataupun help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
kita kena ada this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
eh tak baik say dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik say tak nak jaga mak bapa dia
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that macam kita nak abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say eh tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that ataupun european europe country atau the america they find that sending the
dalam islam okay kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan a must
kind of macam err educate ataupun information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
macam preparation for the future for the future or
I think so because but mm but I don't think so they take nowadays they dia orang macam tak encouraged but they are
they have this macam mana nak cakap eh dia tak encourage tapi dia dah dah ready
I did in this ah they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you dah tua you tak nak tinggal dengan anak you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a um estate where a lot of amenities macam vast or or supermarket doctors dekat dekat and then err the whole building dia orang pun ada macam err
how should I say macam dia orang ada
clubhouse lah something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but dia orang tak macam
macam apa eh
have campaign ataupun macam kasih
tahu dengan public no they just do it you want it
okay this uh we have it you know tapi dia tak ada encouragement ataupun dia kasih macam I find lah macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
an idea ataupun dia come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system mah
they don't they they say said very err how should I say uh tak macam besar tau like very big macam siapa tahu tahu lah siapa tak tahu tak tahu lah that kind of thing
so it's kind of like macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu
then they are they are well informed otherwise takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang be bothered takde orang tahu lah um that's the problem lah
kita tak macam based we are free religious
other activity macam ah more of entertainment entertainment and activity lah you know of ataupun
old folk citizen soon or not far also but err right now people at my age I should say ataupun people at pak age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
atau plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both ada compromise both boleh plan sama-sama and both also boleh you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
oh what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the dah tak boleh juga
I kena orang then I know I don't want to burden my children um
kau orang share cari orang jaga mak that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday ah one of my children must visit me ah macam gitu lah
ah ataupun nanti cuti come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a macam sekarang ni eh banyak karang ni I see like macam my girlfriends
are people that I know ah they have mom which go every week go to every are of err anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu I I don't know whether is it a good idea because mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin is it
oh at this stage eh dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit is it good for her to change
the second option is so much better because dia tak ada burden others because you see ah
anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul ah children wants to but you must also remember anak-anak not the spouse ada anak I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then um anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya
peace also it's like um mak ni macam jadi macam you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you faham tak
unless you macam okay let's see lah this is
ah what I think it's good it's like macam let's say I ada empat anak I ada dua belas cucu something like that dua belas cucu enam yang very um macam dah secondary school ataupun dah pergi tertiary you know which they can help
you know so empat plus enam sepuluh sepuluh ni take turn lah take turns to um go to grandma house to this err monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then err this day to this day okay mak pula yang kena tinggal sana
ah macam take care out dia orang ada ni eh ada helpers twenty four seven dekat dalam rumah tapi err macam make sure stay duduk makan tengokkan dia the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be lah
rather than err kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis I rasa macam gitu lagi better lah emak yang in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
monday and thursday my turn okay dia ni wednesday and friday dia ni so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
other elderly parents so um I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in mak nenek into one station the rest all have to rotate lor whether dementia ke tak dementia ke pun rotate
oh maybe macam cik rosnah lah cik rosnah punya mak lah dia kan macam tu satu place when maid with with the helper than everybody come cik rosnah come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then err also so cute then they have this like macam caregiver punya holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then anak-anak lain have to sit take care
um so macam gitu lah macam pada mak lah better mak that way lor I don't know
lah you got a point there also lah it's what you say tapi kalau sebelum dia orang could are given a task kita kena educate lah the main thing here the the the role model is very important
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them macam kita tak boleh
um macam alamak this week I cannot lah I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go eh I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to um macam kita kena tunjuk positif that kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment oh I can't
ya true sebab masa tu nenek okay
but sekarang ni
tak boleh lah sekarang nenek have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is kuat takpe that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul because dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan
you know kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one nak cuba cuba calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
siapa yang tak marah even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
party must come out kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun ah ikat orang tua um macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid itu yang buat
um banyak terjadi didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this lah because nenek is actually educating me you know
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna macam sakit ke macam um
bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak lah banyak lah kalau lah sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan um
punya punya apa mental mental punya
our readiness oh mesti nak kuat
ya really last time I people always says ah tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I geram sangat ke then what is syurga
macam tu I can't even reach syurga if I do this to my mum
I take care of her not because I want syurga I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to macam
I she's get she got annoyed her you know ataupun you know I tak boleh tahan dengan dia then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
ah ya that's why I said because I cakap I dapat awareness ah so it's something that macam god is given me awareness oh okay this is what you need to do lah that I need I can plan compared
ah twenty four seven take care of punya
orang tua and then they they they now I have ah ah macam my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard atau by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to macam mana nak cakap eh a process of being young and then adult and then old
is everybody have to go through tak semestinya aku beranak kau kau kena take care of me somebody else can take care of me right not ah tu lah kadang bila mak fikir
err macam knowledge macam pergi macam I pergi universiti lepas tu I graduate you know I'm graduated where where I in his life experience that I have to go through no if if I were to given a chance to give um macam
a talk atau macam kasih volunteer atau told people or need help atau need advice I think I have
ya lah you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing ah technician go machine you know macam mana machine
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion dia orang emotional dia orang is so complex that we
don't know ah macam mana professional you are a good ah
it you'd secretaries apa ke all of them based on experience or dia orang punya client punya patients punya experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because dia tak dapat
dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay kita kasih penat tapi tetap keep on scream bukan itu dia tak suka ah dia scream sebab sakit perut you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being dia macam twins lah twins muka sama everything sama tapi tetap perangai lain
her likes and dislikes you know the err for the professional we bring it to the they I just uh based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event dia orang punya
err other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional pun mesti ada family members pun mesti ada and then um very important lah
oh so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the macam
ah apa they call it err
makan ya
ah nevermind just like grandma lah tak tahu macam mana nak bilang actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say nak keluar tak boleh tidur
you know she said ah mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa and then when we stopped her from going out the she said mak nak kencing
there's a oh sebenarnya nak kencing eh ah then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after kencing you tidur okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
err so sometimes kat dalam bilik pun sama and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place atau bilik is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
oh bilik dia sejuk lah kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar she keep on saying nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar then we keep asking why nak keluar then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us ah only if she could tell mak nak keluar because ah bilik ni gelap lah bilik ni sejuk ah okay kita tidur kat luar that will be much
true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers dia dah penuh um
susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada some ah
crack ataupun ulcer ataupun sakit perut I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process ah cuma baby it get get baby kita kita jaga macam dia punya journey is to be independent ah kalau old folks kita jaga needed is to be dependent
it looks quite interesting lah I think kita should pergi like
err I think ada banyak ah ada tom yum ada
macam-macam lah a lot lah I mean we can just go there and see it's quite affordable also
pun ada dia macam steamboat then macam ada tempat you can masak macam apa ni hotplate eh something they call it
hotplate pun ada macam-macam lah
and kita nak tukar to andes pun boleh
biasa lah melayu kan suka barbeque
adam maybe kalau adam nak
so macam okay so because hafizah also tengah tidur sekarang so I also don't know whether dia nak ke tak
car lite I think a bit mahal because weekend then must top up petrol some more
oh tak tahu lah maybe dia letak air kat dalam
oh belum masih dalam bag dalam bag hafizah
ya betul betul actually kita boleh makan kat ni garden you want or not
mm ada fifty percent
mm selain daripada dining in garden apa lagi ada
I mean ya kita boleh ada alternative kat sana banyak alternative
oh jom ah kita pergi sedap mania
kalau tak pergi sadap mania pergi mana
katakan adam tak ikut
boleh lah
ya I mean apa tu okay lah kalau nak kita pergi cuba so our trip can be from
you know maybe bau jer sedap mania habis tu kita nak bicycle
tengok jurassic meyer habis kita makan jinjja chicken tapi kan that time I went to jewel um
uh ahad punya malam
so um the queue ah panjang ah lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward lah duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas so
I tak tahu lah apa tu um macam mana begitu but
ya like singapore memang got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated punya food places ah the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W baru halal kan
dekat jewel pun ada
kita kan nak pergi cycling
ya true also tapi tak boleh cycling
not really sure I think macam crab meat
shiitake cendawan shiitake
ya memang yummy
hari ini cheat day
K ya so macam mana
bukan B B nine eh
bukan eh
um K boleh ah
ke cakap pasal shares lah
I nak try lah baru try try I nak try stock then I macam rasa-rasanya tesla will grow lah in the future
sebab ya because a lot of countries are macam adopting err are banning petrol vehicles by
by investing in macam electric car company ini kan all those clean energy ones
the shares would probably go up lah in the future like maybe not now maybe dalam lima sepuluh tahun
macam bitcoin dulu lah bitcoin dulu also low kan but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance tapi I think like macam those stocks yang
yang permissible macam you know yang tak go against the basic purpose ah macam those thoughts yang deal with um vices then
you know all those macam clearly apa ni
that's my pandangan lah on this
okay for me eh I think kita kena macam
diversify lah our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like macam
uh wahed invest so this is a macam
only macam
syariah compliant punya stocks trading platform lah so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
commodities ah macam cash ke gold
ambil bonds and all these are like certified to be syariah compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in macam these kind of companies
you don't have to put in effort lah you just letak your money then you just
based on my experience dia punya fees is
tapi like maybe this is one
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms yang offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
maybe you can feedback to jangan invest in bonds
macam bank bapa kita
oh like betul lah I mean yang what you say is true cuma
I mean you want apa ethical investing eh in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
those the regular accounts lah me you have no choice what tapi that's why err you have to do your own research lah if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
err mana-mana company I mean mana-mana banks
cakap pasal investment ni macam mana kita punya trip ni
so dia punya kentut signify more to yes ke more to no
kita err
I think she I mean she's free lah it's whether dia nak ke tak
ya maybe dia malas lah tapi anyway dia dah agree apa sunday dia okay
ya mahal sikit ah situ
ubin mana makcik punya
boleh actually boleh tapi semua orang kena okay lah
besok tak crowded
oh so kita dah dah missed lah
unless kita pergi besok
kita pergi terus pergi ubin
oh ya tak nak
any lah islands or whatever sisters' islands ke batu ke bukit
eh itu jangan cuba I I okay punya
I pakai my army boot steady
we can okay lah listen to it later lah takkan nak busuk busuk semua but I mean take the car car lite lah car lite maybe we go in the day

how about those yang tinggal kat at risk blocks
boon keng eh boon keng ada ke at risk block
oh ya I heard also from my uncles because dia orang cakap dia punya kawan pun tinggal sana semua residents
ya pernah
oh I tell you just story lah ya of course lah I mean yang paling err famous is their macam a lot of drug addicts lah kat sana
err let kejap ah apa nama dia
jauh jauh jauh lah I think ah dia tinggal boon keng jauh
oh okay lah lame oh nama dia uh
nama okay lah I shouldn't cakap nama lah pasal tak baik kan kita expose orang I should just panggil dia Q lah
no lah it's one of my relatives lah dia quite kesian lah so
oh so macam ya dia dia tinggal dengan mak dia then dengan datuk dia
oh datuk dia ah
boleh lah datuk dia close juga lah tak close lah pernah jumpa lah like visit
so okay lah cuma kesian lah dia seorang kat rumah dia takde adik beradik kan then mak dia mak dia doctor actually
I'm not sure tapi I think dia general practitioner lah I don't think that specialize in anything
tapi maybe eh if I'm not wrong dia specialise in psychology
boleh lah
dia kawan doctor dia kawan police
vet tak
betul betul I think you didn't mothership ke bukan mother's gossip
ya I think betul lah I mean like kesian juga ah like people look down right all these people tapi in actual fact right you put any human being in that kind of
environment ah I'm talking about the block eh bukan the orang-orang lah block lah you put in that kind of block macam lonely kan takde family I mean takde support adik-beradik so any human being will also macam experience something will experience the same thing lah

cakap pasal nenek so tadi bila I solat lepas I solat then I teringat dia orang cakap
like tadi ah macam I cakap dengan you it's okay to profess love so bila I balik tadi I make it like accidental so I selalu cium mama kan tepi kiri kanan kan
then bila I salam ya I salam nenek abeh I cium dia but obviously nenek is a bit uncomfortable with it then she like elak-elak
you know when you salam her also she's like that what ya
ya she will just immediately retract it back which is damn weird so I macam mm okay lah whatever then I told nenek
oops tersalah nak cium mama alah cium jer lah nenek sekali
no but like the doctor issue is still fine the muntah issue is still fine but the fact that it's so bad that you have to be sent home from work like like
I don't know lah but it's a bit it's not like ngada-ngada ah I feel like I'm a bit like
I don't know maybe maybe ngada-ngada is the word ah I don't know maybe just annoying
ya because I was busy at home if I'm at mama's house I'm usually like talking to nenek and mama
I cannot believe we have to gossip for a good end ah one hour but it's okay these are all juicy details so at least people will actually be entertained when they dengar and dia macam wah actually this couple quite interesting we have to vet this we have dude come on this is not a chore
oh no I I got a red thing which means I berbual kuat sangat

so takpe ah I ada banyak benda seh I boleh berbual kalau dia kasih I berbual seorang for one hour I would do it in a marvelous job it's like having my own
ah apa podcast and talking you know maybe you should
ya but the problem now is I have to make sure there is a fifty fifty ratio dengan you and I tak tahu kalau you boleh
dia cycle daripada pasir ris no ah apa bicycle
no it's not motorbike bicycle his bicycle from he cycle daripada pasir ris all the way ah yang lipat
kepala otak you I don't think that's possible
no ah but he say rabak but he managed to cycle all the way to sembawang and then from sembarang tak I think like chain or something tak tahu
hello mahal eh basikal you tahu norman punya basikal yang kat sebelah tu berapa belas ribu tau

seven thousand ke seven hundred
oh then norman one is berapa belas ribu
berapa belas ribu idaman what

I ada lagi berapa bulan ah for recontract
I know but yours is twenty four months contract but then you took twenty one month so that's three months short if you keep doing that every two years obviously you're short like three it means twenty four months contract dia dah habis
tapi you renew twenty one month so that's three years three months earlier then the next year you do it again earlier three months so that's six months earlier so dia punya date dah lari ah mine could be six months ahead
telefon kita ada ke five G

so macam they trying to
so they have to keep inputing this language kat dalam
ah dia something like that ah ya so that's why dia mesti like collect ramai orang gila punya that one
punya punya conversation
I think a lot people are willing to speak for one hour actually it will be very smart of them to just tap on a conversation because it's very hard to talk bila you kena paksa macam sekarang ah tadi kita nak start kan punya lah susah
I think the other parts I'm not so worried for because ya that's true exactly tu yang I takut
macam lah I tak tahu you punya password eh esok nak masak apa ah

and then ya mama loves to watch al-hijrah punya news because the news all like macam
no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the err adik ipar pakai motor dia motor dia hilang
so rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi which is true lah dia curi lah as in without the permission lepas tu accident
ya but anyway adik ipar dia meninggal bro
oh about the banjir oh then pramugara buka kedai it was quite fun ah actually when we were watching it
kan macam so juicy
besok thursday eh
you rasa apa jadi
pasal there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
lily give birth with seluar
then I thought ushu will kahwin the
ya so complicated and technically he already lafaz cerai
when he said that no he put a syarat he said that if you go and see your father
I will ceraikan you remember
he pull back the cerai is it that's what
because talak will jatuh as long as your syarat is tunai technically dia punya syarat dah tertunai tau pasal dia cakap macam gitu he said kalau what did he say ah something like kalau
you jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau
apa aku cerai apa aku eh macam mana eh
no lah cuma I tahu kalau macam benda gini you kena consult ustaz because ni fasakh
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the talak dah jatuh then you have to just reconcile lah and say aku nikah dengan you know you have to lafaz it back eh no need to lafaz it back but you have to do it with a saksi something like that ah meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why yang that time ija ibu dengan ayah he lafaz it right then they already back together what because mubin kept on pestering them back as long as the talak dah jatuh they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered cerai and they have to immediately consult
ustaz or as in like ah
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to angkat nikah back again
arwah mak long and pak long is cerai cerai dude
kan he already cerai her kan twenty sixteen kan kita kahwin kan ada satu gambar mak long tak ada
ingat tak then mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita and then suddenly pak long say ah okay okay kita then he asked mak long to walk away then I was just there like wah that's mean
kawan I satu mengandung then she complained kat twitter dia cakap yang every time kalau part dia share good news dengan family dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian eh
meaning like like kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak so dia selalu ada anak apa so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
uh doa-doa kakak kau ah yang mengandung you know
no uh ya tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah
tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek then nenek is like saying you know
obviously he's gonna nenek still staying with mama
ya lah he's gonna buy it from pak busu
pak busu bought it at hundred thousandish cheap ah so unfair ah
I pun tak tahu why ya
dia nak hantar anak dia yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year kan anak dia so two years ya so
tu yang tadi one of the parents say
alah dia sihat for the next few years jer dah happy
apa you nak cakap tadi
kan I dah lupa
ni ah nanti lepas ni I treat you to
dalgona kalau tak tidur
I layan ah
no I layan you ah tak tidur
a'ah seh I want to watch more than family seh dah dua hari
dude you lagi into the drama than I am seh cantik eh dia tapi macam flawless
kamal adli macam very like
that's true ah and then meletop I think that was what they talking about like they wanted
semalam aku try main twenty then uh it's not as easy and seamless as I thought it would be sia
starting then you straightaway cam dia kasi kau options nak buat macam mana abeh nak kena buat tu nak kena buat ni so everything was macam flow after flow after flow after flow okay
semalam aku try main it's not like that sia
so ah apa tu kau dah create everything semua once kau dah start the game yet and everything and whatnot kan
apa tu positional positional training tactics kan they give you multiples multiple apa tu
tactic kau pilih sendiri
so formation apa kau nak pakai kau pilih sendiri
no that that is still lah macam they give you pre-default uh
apa style kau nak main in that game for your players to play kan
can depend lah so let's say this game kau main tiki-taka four three one
then the next game kau nak main gegenpress four two three one pun boleh
yang gegenpress tiki-taka is a style of player formation is formation so these two must interlink kalau these two tak interlink
kau nya formation tak leh work
tak boleh ah tapi kalau kau buat gitu
it also depends on kau punya team punya apa tu familiarity of the tactics ah
ada ada ah
wah itu aku belum check sia actually
but yang what I do check is there are multiple new per player roles in that sense ah so macam ah there's this one player dia punya role is a central midfielder
macam their own behaviour in the games lah how they will react in the game ah
but then most of the minor minor leagues ah macam I see I go to the austrian league ke I go to the
aku balik jer dah pukul satu pagi abeh aku main sampai pukul tiga pagi aku dah mampus
in the span of apa tak boleh jadi macam-macam sia dorang improve
dah empat tahun sia
kalau tak salah dah lima tahun siol
tu kau masih poly so bila kau masih poly kan uh
tu kau year three aku year one so that means ya it's been five years ah
it will be quite late lah I mean for now kalau kau pergi download epic games it should be free pe
aku dah cakap dengan kau dia free
aku tak check
cause aku tahu
aku nya laptop yang I buy is meant for gaming
NVIDIA ada ada
semua ada ah all settle already
but should be boleh ah cause on my old laptop yang aku nya graphic card is based on intel's graphic card tau
cannot do anything punya
highly on graphic I mean you know nya graphic macam mana kan
kau tahu dia nya muka kau nya avatar nya muka dah macam
ah then after that your players pun lari dia pun macam you you know lah the graphic is
macam mana kan so
cause most of the game comprises of their data so what's more important in this case is uh kau nak kena ada banyak data untuk kau nya computer ah kalau computer kau tak ada data then
macam tak ada space for you to put all your memory and whatnot then tu yang problem ah but
if kalau computer kau aku rasa ada memory then
macam slack sana sini in bola aku tahu but I
itu aku tak tahu ah how it will turn out lah but then
you can try at least ah maybe when you play the game then cara player dia jalan semua will be a bit
lag sana sini but on top of that
tu touch
not here not there punya type of products kan then I would see why phone will not be able to tahan by itself lah cause uh it's
it's there is too much detail in one team abeh kau tahu dulu kan kau main kan is just
okay player kau gini backroom kau happy dah sudah
settle sekarang dah tak siol
sekarang kan that player ada ada core player core group core social group social group A social group B social group C outliers
macam this type this player as a outlier play the backroom
so you have to push him into the social league ah into social group kalau tak you don't kick him out so that he will not cause distress in the backroom
habis ah backroom kau terus habis ah
they influence influence influence influence terus habis semua tak suka kau abeh kau kena buang
so that means dia dia kirakan macam the senior of the group tau
okay so then kalau kau bring in a fresh new guy let's say uh you bring another senior player from this team masuk your team eh
takde gunanya cause
kau senior kat sana tapi kau masuk tempat ni kau junior juga apa
then but before that he was from dortmund so bila dia balik dortmund straightaway dia masuk balik as a influential player
a senior in the sense tapi kalau let's say kau bawa uh young players like mbappe over to a newer club obviously he doesn't fit there pe
ah so no matter how good he is he still get outlier macam aku punya dortmund sekarang sancho is an outlier
so macam aku campak kau kat tempat lain pun kalau kau sorang melayu kat sana kau pun macam
it's like me when I was in the navy apa
cause kau tahu players kan dorang ada dia punya own friends ke apa benda ke so then they have their own players that they are closed with macam kawan gitu kan so then kalau maybe
you bring him to a new club yang uh
but then kalau kau ada player macam dia suka let's say he favours uh I will give you buckley lah
okay kau bring him to the club buckley ada then maybe from there he mix with buckley he joins the social group yang penting is they join the social group
in a sense lah cause it will affect your dressing room nya happiness ah
so kalau dressing room kau tak happy they don't go out they don't have the motivation to play
so your dressing room nya happiness actually
yes it's only free up to twenty fourth of september tak salah aku
once kau free install it's free forever it's like uh playstation Xbox membership
kau download the games for free you put you already collected the game already you put inside your library kau uninstall kau install balik pun the game is still be free
it's not your laptop nya LAN cable pe it's kau punya router nya cable pe
merepek pe
computer kau berapa lama sia ni
no Zoom lag it's not cause of kau punya itu Zoom will lag only cause of kau punya connection
laptop kau kau dah kau pernah bersihkan tak
cause kadang-kadang kalau laptop kau is dusty or whatnot right it will affect the performance
I tak I mean
susah lah sia kau nak tu it'll be damn slow ah
that game is very intensive sia data dia
aku on tiga league eh aku port aku buka empat league four players per league eh aku nya computer speed jer dia punya processor speed kan for the whole for the whole game tu kan dah four star
empat league jer tau
tak tahu ah kalau kau nak malam kau nak jumpa boleh jumpa ah malam aku tak kesah
aku balik jer terus aku boleh jumpa kau ah
abeh kau fikir aku familiar ah kirakan aku pun baru ambil download jer semalam
ya I downloaded it yesterday okay aku tak I never touch the app
aku tu dah jumpa kau pe
correct aku download aku jumpa kau after aku kita berbual semua and everything aku balik dah pukul satu pagi
aku buka tu computer aku tukar cup sana sini tukar tukar tukar aku tidur pukul tiga pagi
there is that thing lah I just found out about it today only another new feature of their tab kan yang came out
no kau maybe let's say uh okay cause kau tahu you can remove there is a filter in your first few squad pe so kau boleh remove filter ah hide injured players
merepek sia kau
technically you are apa kan bodoh
ah tu kau nak
eh kau tahu kau fikir dorang tinggal kat singapore pe
dulu kau boleh ah tak ada coronavirus you can just go around and ah beli beli beli beli abeh sekarang dah gitu semua dah balik
kau stuck lah unless they didn't go home they stay in your country ah
ah then gitu maybe uh
kau ada chance ah to play and whatnot lah but if
eh apa tu
maybe if satu hari you go lower than that baru you come out with a semi-pro club
so even if you win games your point kena deducted
until someone else macam you know what
atau they pump atau your board just okay you know what screw it I pump in a lot of assets
you relegate up cause you only have two K you relegate time tu championship which needs five K
but whether your club kat dalam ah the club kau ada loss ke ada profit ke ah there it
tak kira dah cause at the end of day
kalau player kau
ada there are there are a few clubs that did that the most recent one was this italian club I forgot what club it was
okay so dah tinggi pe kirakan serie A pe dia up there tau and then
itu lain lah itu tak kira lah bodoh
the board like they just liquidate the club so the club cease to be existed cease to be exist ah terus hilang
nari ada club esok takde club ah gitu ah
so terus takde ah then club dia hilang that's one thing so uh what
the fans did was they gather together a small sum of money each fan kasi berapa ke
that you know lah some of the fans in this club kan quite rich pe so dorang kata okay you know what aku suka club ni but then sekarang hilang sebab apa dorang takde duit okay ah aku pump duit
but ada ada yang lain ah tu really aku tak tahu ah sia kau kena kau kena
cari sendiri ah tu aku
kita ada sia actually
then you have your sunday league A sunday league B sunday league C you have all sort of leagues going on I mean I played in a few leagues myself apa so then they have been a lot of leagues where you can actually
kita mimpi jer lah tu eh
at the end of day kita semua semi-pro sia
if you're passionate about it then okay pe macam
dah gemuk cakap jer lah dah gemuk tak yah lah
so then macam
tu lah kau baru nak cakap
tak ah
dalam empat tahun jer lah
aku dah dalam dua dua tahun juga tak main ah I mean
sekarang dengan situation gini camne aku nak main bola sia
so what this guy did was dia tak slide ah
I'm in front of you I cannot slide aku tak boleh slide tackle kau kan so aku baring on the floor ah
aku baring jer
terus bola will hit badan aku kau will jump over me apa
aku bangun I take the ball run away ah
aku tak pernah dengar sia orang buat gini kau first time siol abeh macam
boleh boleh cause
takde time kan
ah ya lah betul lah I mean
memang gitu lah I mean apa kau nak buat kan
kerja tetap kerja apa daripada kau takde duit I mean tengok kita sekarang
no lah yang the apa tu
one thing yang we need to go and find kan is that cup lee hsien loong used
eh tu cawan bagus siol kau minum jer kau tukar kau boleh berbual ah bahasa lain sia
aku minum melayu aku minum cina aku minum ah kau
dia boleh pe
kau tak I mean the the election before the previous election kan
I would listen to melayu if I somewhat understood chim malay lah I mean kau tengok when I had to go for the interview in malay eh nanti kena berbual bahasa melayu ye
aku gabra siol
aku berbual sana sini abeh aku masukkan ini sini sana sedikit so it was a very singlish mixed malay type of thing ah so it's like how I'm talking to you now okay then oh okay sorry nak kena berbual melayu so nari buat gini gini gini abeh apa word ni eh
takpe aku keluarkan english word ah then I speak english again so it's very
it's not it's no longer our mother tongue it's always it's always english I've seen kids macam hari tu aku pergi ah aku gi pancing pe kat changi kan
aku tengok budak-budak main bila dorang main nak berbual dengan each other kan they don't talk in malay
it was a full out english fest so I was confused whether itu budak cina ke tu budak melayu cause dia berbual english kan dia nya english was
better than our parents lah in a in a sense lah cause their english was quite fluent so when I look over it's actually malay kids so aku macam
okay ni budak melayu and then budak melayu tak boleh berbual melayu
melayu is a first language english is their second language
so there's a chance bila kita dah tua
kita tak akan ingat any other language except for
but then you weren't in malaysia apa you were in singapore customs so you wasn't she wasn't in malaysia she was in singapore
for example lah kita tak tahu berbual melayu at all dia langsung tak ada melayu okay kita cuma boleh berbual english
you see back in our elders' time the language they use everyday is malay pe maybe that makcik was sebab apa tu ah dia belajar
english dengan dari tempat lain then dia forever concentrate dengan english
ah abeh kita tak tahu pe anything can happen kan
ah ye abeh lepas tu aku dah berbual gitu kau faham tak kan apa gunanya aku berbual kan betul tak
all these old people kalau you actually listen to them talk kan some of them do make sense lah I mean they can impart some life lessons but other time merepek sia dengar
ya sudah dah sudah itu itu kau jangan nak bawa balik
oh dia jiran kau okay lah tu kau boleh buat member
aku nampak pernah nampak dia jalan balik kat sini so aku tak tahu dia tinggal mana okay lah aku dah tahu ah
mana tahu dia nak buat kawan dengan kau ini budak aku macam kenal ah hari tu aku nak buat kawan dengan dia ah it can be like that pe
all I see tadi err bila aku nak naik gi rumah kau ni kan aku sesat uh
aku dah masuk lift okay so there was another couple with me in the lift so they press the twelve floor then I down there aku stuck dekat dengan nombor tu aku tengok
tingkat mana sia dia tinggal aku lupa lapan ke sebelas then in my mind
correct house eh kalau tak malu sia aku turun lagi pergi tingkat lapan
kau tahu last aku datang rumah kau bila ah
time kau tau
time kau
time kau CISCO aku tak datang rumah kau tau
ada sekali kau datang eh no there was one before after kau CISCO juga aku baru masuk so time kau datang sebab kita baru keluar makan pastu kau nak
balik rumah kau nak change out to your army uniform and everything to book in so aku teman kau aku datang rumah
then aku lepak-lepak kat living room kau
second time was cause kita nak keluar makan dengan parents aku pastu kau suruh aku datang rumah kau kejap entah buat apa that was the only two times ah
to sit down and properly lepak dalam rumah kau ni the last time I did that kita masih secondary school
most of time aku jumpa kau bukan kat rumah pe
masih ah kau
tak tahu lah
kau tahu kan the situation sekarang kan you've been unemployed longer than I have
teruk siol
singapore airlines now flights to nowhere kau tahu kan
so kapal terbang dia keluar
pusing pusing pusing pusing pusing pastu balik ah tak gi mana-mana
no just to maintain airtime and to apa tu free up ah parking space
cause kalau kapal kau kapal terbang kau tak terbang for very long
it can run down macam let's say aircon you don't use your aircon for very long aircon can spoil it's the same thing with aeroplanes ah
which is why most of their ah apa tu employees all retrenched
kau masuk if you want your things to run you have to on your generators you cannot plug in to a short supply your short supply will not be enough
kau tak leh compare
mahal that's why they
so the apa tu the postal macam okay ah aku nak buat deed good deed so ah aku nak send out
free masks to every household just for free ah aku send out to everybody everybody can be safe
and they no no no no no aku tak approve ni tak boleh masks tak work the masks doesn't work so no
and then some more there's this person they came out with a a mask a mask a proper face mask with holes inside macam fish nets
kau tahu fishing net kan ada lubang lubang tu kan so mask dia berlubang
and then kau pakai so case kau masih boleh nampak mulut nampak hidung ah tapi kau masih pakai mask
ah ye mask doesn't work but then the first
that but then doctors and nurses all have been using it for damn long cause it doesn't work ah kirakan
ya lah dua ribu dua puluh we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
kan tu lah masalahnya
semua resolution pun dah tak tercapai semuanya
err of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye lah cakap pasal redo back everything sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight lah memang nak nak turunkan berat badan lah harap harapnya macam tu tahun target eh
this year target nya lebih kurang dalam maybe fifteen ya
serious ah sihat ke kalau macam tu
oh I cannot do the skipping sebab dengan spine issue lah so macam kalau skipping nanti patah pula tulang belakang so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
tu lah
ya achievable so I would say that kalau fifteen maksudnya dalam sebulan kena target at least two lah
tapi tapi sebenarnya one half pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu lah lebih kurang
ya so that's another thing lah pasal vegetarian kan macam ya before this sebab baru adapt to vegetarian so banyak makan processed food lah
actually adapt tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat macam tu kan sebenarnya tak boleh so I was thinking of this year kalau boleh nak jadi vegetarian and grow my own food like tanam sayur ataupun tanam
tanam sayur lah basically kita orang dah tanam benda lain kan macam tu lah anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution untuk tahun ni
for business apa lah apa apa the idea business yang dah ada buat masa ni
I see surprise delivery menarik
I see so the surprise part lah yang betul-betul make meaningful
I see so macam mana sebelum delivery ni dia akan ada macam set set dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh customise ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu
okay faham
so basically ni macam err macam bukan professional dia macam lebih kurang special customisation lah
okay tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam uh food based ke ataupun
oh okay lah okay maksudnya dah ada customer ah
oh wow ya ya ya ya sebab ya lah sekarang ni orang pun suka eh macam boleh pergi surprise delivery lepas tu boleh hantar eh boleh share dekat Insta kan macam tu lah
I see interesting it's interesting so apa lah nama the surprise delivery service ni apa nama dia
oh wow okay kotak riang so kotak riang basically like macam gift uh box of happiness lah box of happiness
okay okay okay betul betul new year resolution lah
so what do you have for now ada tak benda-benda yang ya it's still give you some happiness in the world tapi healthy lah
I see tapi sugar free how is that achievable even
menarik menarik so err healthy diet healthy food
basically ya lah macam kita pun tengok kan dengan COVID punya issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat kan ah so ya penting lah very very important lah untuk
tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah when you get rich I will be the first person yang you have to belanja lah kan aduhai
oh resolution lain apart from losing weight I would say that okay lah dia macam satu we have to look at the whole system lah kan I started with trying to eat
healthily kan I want to err I want to lose weight so I have to live live err I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just kita nak kurangkan berat badan is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet kan most of the thing yang you beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak tau
especially sayur lah macam tu kan jadi macam I was thinking of and kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam supermarket
kan so we didn't know pun macam kita opt untuk healthily tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya lah mm kita tahu economically macam mana
macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya sekarang ni ramai juga kan orang monetise daripada YouTube kan and then ya betul betul and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
betul betul okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya macam
orang kata tanam jer lah tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara kan ya ya ya
ya interesting hmm okay boleh boleh masuk dalam resolutions seterusnya okay
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so cakap pasal healthy and rich kan kalau lah you nak sum up lah the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word lah apa you punya apa one word yang will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
wow oh okay alright alright maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni the the timeline the the stories not good yang you need the plot twist
untuk diri sendiri eh
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person macam it ya maybe with better networking kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh bring it forward kan ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself lah I would say that two thousand twenty dengan COVID dan sebagainya it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
tak jadi apa-apa pun so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world lah like environmentally more friendly lah
okay apa lagi takkan tu jer apa lagi share lah resolution
mmhmm what what kind of me time like pergi bowling macam tu
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill yang you dah ada and then you want to enhance ataupun like new skill
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like jadi ya jadi pemain guitar oh my god
ah okay ya masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama I didn't really update
but but somehow piano like ini dua benda yang berbeza tau mostly guitar punya song it's like metal you know very hard one piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it juga makin besar makin matang you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
I see so with before this kak long pernah juga ada idea macam nak enroll class tau and of course I want to also look into yang macam elegant elegant ni lah kan cuma kenapa bukan piano sebab piano requires some set up lah then tak dapat berlatih kat rumah kan macam tu so I was thinking of beli ukulele ke violin something like that lah so macam at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you kan kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak wind punya apa ni punya instruments you need a whole band baru dia akan menjadi or you main trumpet sorang-sorang macam ni lah dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward tu clarinet that's clarinet so it will
ah Squidward kan so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it lah macam tu
interesting okay lah basically kan macam kita boleh tengok kan sometime our education system
focus on more maths science tapi kan art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things tu dalam bentuk visual ataupun audio lah macam music kan because somehow that makes us
err be more empathy kan dan buat kita more human lah and in your own case kan macam memang buat hard science buat maths kan err
at the end you will turn to robot lah if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you macam tu kan okay so piano so that's the skill yang basically dream lah belum belum start ah do you have any skill yang just you want to enhance lah yang you dah ada dah ada base base[lah
ataupun something lah selain daripada skill err musical skill ada skill lain tak
but mandarin is kinda hard though because tak silap mandarin kan dia ada macam empat
empat macam apa eh apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi something you know
ya that's the thing sebab basically ya bila kita boleh connect to to a person dengan dia punya mother tongue it will be lebih ni lah kan
ya ya lagipun kita pun multi racial I think it's best untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga kan betul betul interesting interesting
so okay buat masa sekarang how many language you know like even it's amateur pun tak faham how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea daripada mana because you watch oh my god alright alright
so many language cakap pasal korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not tapi dia berkaitan dengan business lah since you pun nak buat business kan
ya cerita tu menarik tau because dia menunjukkan macam mana yes
so orang selalu tengok kan orang business ni at at the end of the success tau like the only the tip of the iceberg lah when ya and then macam kita pun jealous lah bila dia lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
even though macam belum kaya lagi but there every single day I woke up
even though I would say that sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself benda yang paling belajar is you need a good mentor
macam bila you bila you dah kaya ramai jer orang yang akan datang kan berpusu-pusu tapi basically kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul care ataupun just nak ride on us macam tu kan
ya that's the thing so cakap pasal tak kaya tapi means a lot sebab
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself adalah untuk selesaikan social issues like
ikut lah issue nya about environmental ke apa kan so because I do believe that in the in the in the keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan
kita perlukan orang buat business untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work lah kita pun tahu politician have so many other things kan tapi I would say that business kita boleh provide like kita boleh provide ya macam cakap lah kerja untuk orang kan kita boleh provide service diorang macam in your case you nak buat surprise delivery kan you boleh make people happy and so I would say that
instead of ya lah I used to work juga dulu kan dengan boss boss bukannya senang kan kita salah pun
kita salah memang confirm salah kita betul pun kita salah kan jadi macam ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age lah untuk
try error jatuh explore ya explore
jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat sometimes you didn't know macam awak tengok kan business business yang dah berjaya
that take years then even just take even one to two years lah yang one to two years ni bukannya entrepreneur dia grant-preneur sebab dia dapat duit daripada grant kan macam tu lah
tapi basically kan err orang perlukan at least six seven years untuk dia betul-betul ada strong base kan so if you stop too early
macam let's say kita nak makan durian kan even though we already see the buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok durian kan kita sibuk nak makan durian nak makan durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit kan it's not going to taste good even though you nampak hari-hari tapi you kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri
tapi the the biggest thing ialah perseverance untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening kan tapi
what kenapa apa what what what was
oh so itu adalah interesting part I would say that
he is a good actor tau so basically err sebenarnya kan bagus jer cerita start up ni walaupun dia letak satu lead actor yang teruk gila tapi basically dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang
lead actor pun dah terlalu superficial tau macam terlalu hebat so sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda
so walaupun awak tak tengok character nam do san tu sangat-sangat loser kan tapi basically that's how people at twenties macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu
compare to someone yang dah macam han ji pyeong yang dah thirties tau
so tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang production ni pun tak sangka dia akan backfire macam ni
sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada synopsis kan ada seorang mentor yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat han ji pyeong tapi because he is a good actor himself yang membuatkan
kita move dengan perasaan dia sampai kita sedangkan character tu tanpa tanpa interpretation daripada dia kan mungkin akan jadi character yang sangat annoying
harsh lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi because err the actor himself kan put so many emotions on the face
aiya many conflicts err conflicting emotions yang kita tahu yang he is not bad he is just
err mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati lah tapi when I think back and if I am mad at nam do san I would say that I'm mad at younger me juga
nonton suka hati kita lah kita nak suka siapa kan that is our own right tapi I would say it's a good reflection lah it's a good reflection
three years pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus that's the thing
sebab yang lain ada character development tau the other two friends tapi yang tu macam stay like just like that
ya just just better sikit lah ada coat sendiri tak payah pinjam that's the only improvement made kan kan tu lah aduh
okay ada lagi ke resolution untuk tahun ni anything eh untuk tahun ni
eh small thing seh yang buat benda jadi great and big ya
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya lah macam zaman study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute kadang-kadang boleh push you
like push you lah macam in the very last minute kan you boleh focus and sometimes your creative juice like macam tu kan tapi masalahnya in real life kan when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as err persekitaran lah environment macam tiba-tiba COVID dan sebagainya kan so macam
procrastination akan backfire you compare to someone belajar yang it's just you and your assignment lah macam tu kan
maybe because you are a person yang work under pressure
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you kena you kena combine kerja you dengan team mate lain like just imagine if the team mate buat macam tu to you kan at the last day baru dia nak submit dia punya
drag yourself ya betul betul betul procrastination
and somehow sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa lah procrastination ni pun
sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya social media juga kan macam in my own case lah I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video kan tiba-tiba another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so itu yang menarik then tu lah tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu kan ada tengok satu documentary tau dekat
documentary dekat Netflix ah cerita pasal social network tau macam mana sebenarnya since since kita guna all this services for free kan macam Facebook and all those thing kan basically we are
pelik ah sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah customer kan tapi kita tak bayar so tu maksudnya kita bukan customer maksudnya kita adalah
data err their their modal macam tu kan so
so dia dah baca tau kita punya behaviour dia dah baca kita punya interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so macam dia tahu macam mana nak keep us hook kita tengok one lepas satu-satu kan lagi satu aduh lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar
macam fikir fikir contoh kata oh rasa nak beli katil ah tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us lah kan our microphone is always on kita tak pernah pun default untuk tutup kan somehow
ya tapi maksudnya ya maksudnya kalau lah basically okay kalau diorang dengar diorang just feed us dengan ads okay lah tetap okay juga lah sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli kan but how about if bad people
so tu lah macam bila kita bila kita gunakan service ni for free kan for free
so kita basically menjual diri kita to them lah like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me sebab tu penting kita baca like agreements and all term and condition
macam tu lah like term and condition if you agree tick siapa pun nak baca tick kan kat situ that that's the thing
tapi takpe lah basically the basically the idea is walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku at least kita tahu dia ambil so at least kita boleh jaga-jaga lah more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things kan macam tu
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now macam dulu kan like ten years back kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa that is something like ridiculously happened tau macam
kan kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita uh cik boleh tak saya tengok
err saya nak tengok apa periuk err dapur macam mana ada hood ke tak ada hood uh ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person kan because that person boleh buat live dekat dia punya
bilik kan macam tu
ya ya even oh my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched dia siap tunjuk the secret room
and basically kan senangnya sekarang ni with the technology ada the semua kan dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik your plan house plan tau
hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun technology yang ada with with pictures you take pictures you can even like kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then macam nak masuk pun senang
yes and somehow this wealthy people pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan post so orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya rule dalam kita post social media ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh post pasal vacation after the vacation
yes sebab basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then curi lah apa saja
itu lah dunia sekarang different lah people
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing tau macam orang dulu kan dia communication nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu jer lah masa untuk interact tau so you really have to all out kan tapi people nowadays kan dia neglect
organik punya communication tapi dia boleh share every single thing about dia punya life kan tapi bila orang judge dia marah pula
orang tak like tak tak tak bagi reactions pun dia marah kan so
so okay cakap pasal tu that's there's one more lah one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution lah twenty twenty one oh my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day tau macam
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone tau so I was like macam I want to segment lah macam okay pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically kadang-kadang check tu actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then macam then all the video sometimes is err ridiculous err like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness kan so macam
so I want to segment lah macam okay dalam masa tiga jam ni I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it macam tu lah that's the idea
macam quota ah
oh you can ignore lah dia tak macam parental parental control yang terus off oh okay okay
just just to remind you lah bukan lah macam guru discipline something like that kan
tapi ada apps tau untuk buat benda tu which is very interesting I just download it lah macam nama dia forest tau so macam bila you start the apps kan you kena set lah you nak you nak buat kerja berapa lama
okay so dia ada beza tau tiga puluh minit dia punya shrub jer kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok tau kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah tau
so basically kan dia untuk bantu you untuk err focus so you buka app you set tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja kan so you tak boleh buka apps lain you kena tutup dengan apps tu sahaja
kalau lah tiga puluh minit you access your phone pokok tu akan mati tau tapi kalau kalau you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan notify you okay pokok tu dah hidup and basically everyday you have a patch of forest untuk dibangunkan
yes very interesting so macam ah so macam basically kan dia bagi kita award macam dia bagi reward lah reward macam
okay so kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian
tak so depress
a'ah maksudnya
betul sebab manusia ni sukakan acknowledgement tapi takkan kita nak suruh ya yes
takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam kan it's just like boss datang okay congratulations four hours kan tak logic ah kan
that's very intriguing seh tu satu benda forest ada satu lagi tau interesting juga nama dia sleepy town so apa yang kita buat adalah err kita set lah satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam kan so bila nak tidur kita buka apps tu dan tutup phone dengan apps tu on on running lah okay
so kalau you bangun dalam masa you dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun you pasal you tak access phone dah lepas you dah set the alarm kan you akan bina the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping lah so you will enjoy it when you so dia lebih daripada quality life lah so macam
interesting I ya lah saja jer nak tengok apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep tau tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok phone sebab nak tengok sekejap jer end up kan
mula-mula jer yes end up Netflix tiba-tiba kan tiba-tiba so basically dia memang dia memang ada design untuk bagi orang hook
and tapi kita kena take back the power lah we have to unhook all that
ya yang peliknya dia bukan macam puppy tau yang macam memang sentiasa entertain anyone dia diva and then macam
make macam sangat-sangat annoying ah macam if if I need you rub me rub me now and when I don't like it I will just leave you macam tu kan
tu lah orang cakap kan macam bila kita bela kucing kita yang jadi servant to the cat
I think because they are cute tapi elegant
they they keep their eh I know tak lah macam cara dia tidur you know then oh tapi tak juga
tapi tapi ya cats can be very then sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam
ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang instead of bela anak kan maybe sebab bela binatang lebih bagus lah kot dari bela anak kan sebab bela anak ni
yeah maybe sometimes diorang investment so
macam tu lah
oh my god zombie apocalypse tapi agaknya okay lah ya zombie apocalypse tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa
I don't know I I have seen the video people cakap the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know lah tapi I would say apocalypse akan berlaku so be it zombie or not but still ah kata lah kalau that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers tau macam menarik ah orang yang boleh buat bunkers kat bawah rumah kan macam tu because you want to save save your family lah at least and sebab
tak payah tak payah zombie lah apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada food ration
and then at least ada survival skill kan let's say lah kalau berlaku
disasters kan actually zombie apocalypse akan leads kepada disaster ah dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah ah kan dan sebagainya kan so um kita kena ada survival skill
let's say kalau macam mana kita nak um menyorok kat mana kan ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab ya lah so far nak cakap pasal zombie ni kita tak tahu zombie tu macam mana
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see kan can only err listen ah macam tu kan so tak tahu cuma I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared lah kan
let's say kalau zombie semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang kan so kita kena
ah duduk dalam air kan betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air at least kita kena basic macam rafting ke apa macam tu kan
ya it's not zombie ah we call it bunk out bag dia macam
err bag tu ada cukup lah untuk something happened ada macam first aid macam ada dry food and then macam err your details pasal you punya your blood semua kan so macam kalau orang jumpa you terbaring ke apa you ni tapi kita panggil bunk out bag lah macam tu ya but kalau kalau kita cakap zombie kit tu orang akan rasa oh it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie kan but actually err disclaimer sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja jer lah it don't have to be zombie let's say lah kalau ada orang masuk rumah you yes war we don't we never know kan macam even though kita rasa everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year yang buatkan apa pun kita punya resolution tak tercapai tu kan so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so mmhmm
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it lah so macam tak tahu lah kalau macam overseas kan orang akan macam ada kan non disclosure kan macam tu tapi macam
I would say that berapa berapa probability dan possibility dia ah then macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya contractor tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana kan so macam boleh berlaku tapi I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous lah sebab maybe ah kan macam for now I would say that if we pun orang akan rasa oh this for safety
but for people yang macam influential kan let's say say it's um
ya kalau dalam movie kalau macam mafia ni kalau orang tu buat bunker untuk dia dia tembak jer lepas tu kan ah of course lah we cannot do that kan
cakap pasal rumah it's very interesting kan how ya people try to customise house kan macam buat secret room macam buat bunker and now people sekarang macam buat apa catio untuk kucing lah eh macam buat hub ya
cat is like social media ah hook you kan macam tu
and make them you know that's the thing err we call it like cat nourishment ah macam cats used to live in the wild tapi kita yang bring in the home kan so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is kejar rama-rama
things like that kan so that is tapi kalau ada rumah the first thing I want to have is swimming pool lah
seriously you want to hi and things waktu swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least bukan semua baka lah maybe some some breed can lah macam I would say bengal ke apa yang yang very wild one kan tapi basically kalau perasan semua kucing berenang most of them adalah yang short hair
ya instead of long hair ah macam tu sebab so kalau long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then tak dapat macam wiggle wiggle badan dia how dogs do it kan
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place untuk macam
buat yoga with all the sun you know because somehow kan kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then kita most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D tau but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight kan so I was thinking kalau ada rumah kan in the middle of the house I want to make sure the dia punya dinding tu
um made from glass no no made from glass so dia dia dia
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight macam tu
like buat like igloo style so macam dok macam macam ni lah kubah macam tu
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive lah kan macam during this trying time kan macam ya every new year pun kita buat resolution kan pastu kita buat plans and everything because we want to look forward in life lah
macam and most of dreamers pun orang rasa macam crazy people in the beginning kan macam
macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik wright kan the the the wright brothers kan
macam when they want to fly things siapa jer yang setuju
tapi now that is diorang punya determination tu yang membuat we can cross country kan kita boleh experience things on the other side of the world
betul I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected lah dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat heavily affected
sebab ya lah diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak operate kan
oh tak boleh langsung ya then most people yang kerja dalam industry tu diorang adalah macam skillful people tapi in one area tau so diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain
ya that's interesting like paramedics pun boleh kan macam tu like basic basic ah menarik menarik so ya lah macam
because senang kan bila orang kena lay off ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena lay off sekarang sangat
dan somehow apart from dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan industry revolution industry kan bila everything's automated semua benda pakai robot pasal dia akan take away our jobs kan tiba-tiba kita berlaku economic punya macam ni yang yang merudum kan so
sebab itu lah kita buat business kot kan boleh lah bantu orang maybe provide more jobs to people kan sebab the economy have to run lah
ya because somehow dengan ramai orang kena laid off employer pun ada banyak sangat pilihan so the competition is very very high
macam tu kan
and cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada business kan lah
I would say that kesan besar kepada education system juga lah kan macam kids nowadays I would say sometimes bagus juga sebab orang dah mula adopt online learning sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan interactions
dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam universities kan some universities are err fully err fully on online platform kan
tapi bila kita dekat university kita bukannya hanya belajar theory dan kita punya subject tapi life lesson macam
kita belajar communicate kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi kan so all that adalah very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime boleh juga bagi tapi I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
ya betul betul ya
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose kan tapi friends adalah orang yang you boleh choose ya kan so macam
you boleh choose and and boleh align minat dan sebagainya kan compare to ni then ya lah macam same eh macam peer kan macam same age peer sangat sangat penting untuk kita associate untuk kita faham
dan sebagainya so
ya akan jadi ada impact yang besar lah kepada characters building macam tu
ya just imagine before this pun graduates susah nak dapat kerja because
it's a very competitive market kan and now kita ada so many
err talented people kena laid off and compete together with them
ya macam dah lah nak compete each other pun dah hard enough and then kena compete lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun experience it's not going to be easy
tapi new economy pun akan terbuka lah macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi influencer kan sebab ya like influencer pun boleh give money
dah lama kan
cuma bahaya dengan being influencer ni sometimes they are not being human tau macam
and they ya and diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu social status yang sometimes unachievable kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar kan untuk bagi nampak abs nampak kurus sometimes it's just about angle
then people yang see that they didn't know pun itu adalah angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that sedangkan all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle kan camera trick that's the thing sometimes
dah lah tu lah jadi lebih mencabar lah kat kita punya youth kalau keadaan macam ni ya lah lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
ya even big brands pun sekarang dah start to work with influencers instead of artists yang memang buat art tau berkarya
okay lah somehow artist people diorang charge memang terlalu mahal kan and influencers dia ada dia ada bigger fan base
ya faham
dan artist dan actress ni dia terpaksa produce something dulu kan baru orang boleh look up to them kan compared to influencer ni
pergi makan pun orang suka kan pergi jogging pun orang suka kan so macam cuma tu lah kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh set unrealistic thing ah
so fuh banyak juga kita borak ni kan daripada start dengan resolution cerita pasal zombie apocalypse dan sebagainya so ya hopefully takpe lah yang penting kita start sekarang buat sekarang macam
ya boleh
untuk family ah untuk family err I would say that more collaborations macam
ya lah before this I would say that I live on my own lah pun duduk macam jauh kan so macam
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal kan tapi I want this family to be more collaborative like masak sama-sama
buat kerja sama-sama and even though macam ya lah adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one kan even though of course lah macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah kan tapi basically ah but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
kadang-kadang macam ya lah kita pun kena bergerak sebagai family
betul how about you apa yang you uh foresee for as a family punya movement
aduhai okay lah
ya ya ya hopefully lah macam and it don't have to be far pun but at least places that we can
okay jom rasanya
boleh lah kan kita start put in the planner ataupun buat vision board kan letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa kan and satu benda lagi it's good tau actually bila kita tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us lah
ya because when we say it kan tak ada lah nanti at the end takkan lah nanti at the end of the year nanti macam eh apa jadi dengan macam tu kan so macam
aku dah tak pergi gunting rambut sangat lah macam aku lost
interest lah aku dah tak aku dah tak apa ni um

I mean tak lah aku betul juga now now that you now that you mention about err last time when we were in school we
sekarang aku baru ingat balik actually ya lah actually quite true lah macam aku used to
primary school aku dulu kat katong punya area kan then
then there was macam a lot of
macam drains ada banyak longkang-longkang besar
so that time tengah primary school tengah pendek kecil kan so like
after school nanti main bawah longkang masuk bawah longkang then keluar dekat lagi satu punya longkang punya area keluar kat luar jer kan
that kind of thing so a'ah lah betul juga lah so I think
wow jauh eh actually wow hougang sampai bukit batok jauh seh
park connectors dia tampines
ya it's from tampines to pasir ris like a shortcut bagi pergi ya main basikal so
so far if kalau pergi jauh-jauh aku tak pernah aku tak pernah realize seh
ya dah ada ya dah ada

ada ada ada err actually actually tampines street forty five yang belakang is actually connecting
dia actually connected to connected to bedok bedok reservoir err then
nowadays my school is only err usually now is only four days sahaja
now at this age nothing much to do lah so ya quite sian lah like macam like
I thought macam I thought like I thought
macam like seven eleven jobs is easy to get kan but
to work somewhere in uh plaza singapura lah plaza singapura then I can err it's
second they called me they say which ah which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza singapura then
they send my resume to plaza singapura then
they have a different way of macam approaching things lah they
people have more macam people are more more polite lah bila I talk to people
macam really down to earth they they know
east coast apa tu

nak kena mandi nak kena
nak kena bersihkan pasir-pasir you know that kind of thing habis dengan
pagi-pagi buta rambut tak shampoo all that macam aku tak macam

pendirian diri ah eh bukan bukan lah I don't know what lah sudah macam like
self esteem lah aku
will affect my choices macam aku will affect aku punya
err whether aku nak ikut kau orang pergi east coast overnight ke tak

nak kena pack barang-barang aku semua lah like like
like I've to make sure aku ada ini ada itu ada ini so besok aku will feel
maybe mungkin it's a mungkin it's a penyakit ah I don't know lah but ya lah
ya I think I think I think betul juga ah apa yang kau cakap macam like um
macam let's say macam main dekat rumput main dekat rumput kadang-kadang I mean aku
aku punya mind kan aku dah fikir pasal rumput tu kan
nanti automatic kan automatically aku punya kaki gatal sendiri tau macam
suddenly aku dah rasa dia punya gatal dia macam pasal aku

straightaway kaki aku dah rasa gatal dulu macam
aku rasa ada something ah macam tangan aku pun kalau tangan aku
macam ada sweaty palms ah berpeluh
kalau kalau kalau aku tak fikir pasal apa-apa apa-apa eh
dia okay tau tapi bila time aku
nak start buat kerja something ke apa eh
bila time aku dah start dekat depan computer aku nak fikir lama jer kan
aku rasa straightaway tangan aku berpeluh tau so macam
dia ada effect juga ah macam
aku rasa anxiety problem ah macam
macam oh aku kena habiskan kerja ni
masa tempoh ni then straightaway aku punya otak aku dah fikir oh
dah ada macam jadi rasa takut lah
oh jadi
itu lah asyik berbual pasal aku jer daripada tadi

ya betul ah eh I remember I remember those times lah macam
err hopeless lah you feel quite sad lah like like like macam like
macam going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship lah like

I asked around lah I said how to go for audition right untuk apa ni how to start theatre how to do theatre
eh no no I didn't go audition I attend the workshop first it was a free workshop on sunday kat sub station so then lepas tu ya lah every week I go attend workshop I do I learn about acting
and then apa tu uh one day like uh my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
somehow they get somebody cause kita free kan they get us to just lie there
like in the middle of the show lah before intermission one of the character cakap what the character say macam oh who is this you know then after that reveal lah so like wah a dead body
until the end everybody dah balik
but ya lah because cannot cannot move what so my kaki semut semut you know
but then kaki semut semut you cannot move right so you need to learn macam your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise yang how hard it was until um they got a review lah somebody wrote a review then cakap
complain lah they complain banyak banyak about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
cakap about the best potrayal was the portrayal
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing bila I think got this one uh kakak melayu
orang rupanya so she was like she was surprised yang she so she was shocked lah to realise actually I was a real person lah so okay
um mula mula so not wrapped ah macam dorang ada cover dengan kain gitu ah
ah no no no no no as in so dia macam apa tu
my there will be a set kan kat belakang tu ada macam ada the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me lah ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that lah so I
so my leg actually boleh lah my leg can move but then err just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
um then no we were like training what we wanted macam training then after that apa tu um second show I was
stage managing I was helping and then after that um the actor problem lah tak tak selalu tak datang lah apa tu hangover lah blah blah blah then after that the director cakap
there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just apa tu um can you just
and then my director macam wah I never knew you can act eh so then she text me then say okay then next time um can you take over his role lah because he's very problematic
but simpan tak
actually itu ah what is influencer
ya actually it's true ah that time where I so geram you know pasal apa tu I got I was trying to promote one of the my programs lah when I was doing coordinating work right I was coordinating apa tu um
her Facebook posts one Facebook post and one Instagram post ya and itu pun bukannya dia macam uh she write any oh no
she actually she wrote something but dia punya her posts were so funny because
the after that post is very hard to track whether apa tu yang the
your your press conference eh no press kit no bukan apa
apa lah
your post bukan they put on theirs right
is it like some of the comments dorang cakap apa
mm mm habis
tak tidur ah kau
tu pun kirakan macam apa tau macam branding kan
eh apa tu number
company apa nak buat uh
what have you thought about apa tu your branding about your selling point eh apa ni bising bising
tu lah oi
perlahan-lahan sikit boleh tak ai okay okay okay tak apa um
kecoh lah okay patut boleh quiet tapi dorang semua
company okay you wanted to sell apa tu nak jual buka kedai
can jangan lupa nak kena code switch sikit eh nak kena code switch melayu okay
bagus lah bagus lah so ah it's
selling marketing tu yang paling the difficult at the moment actually nak buat
one person said to me lah nak apa tu kalau nak
nak buat business senang
cuma nak sustain tu ya nak sustain
apa yang orang nak orang pun semua macam very fickle
hmm what do you mean tak faham
orang yang bayar ya
dia punya dia punya sense orbit lah the fashion sense
not bad so siapa yang jual I mean siapa yang buat
where you manufacture you jahit sendiri
pandai mana kau dapat suruh contact contact sebegini
kena ajar juga eh sometimes okay
but from dari kecil from growing up you really wanted to do this ah
apa lah tak apa
engkau memang yes
apa apa yang cons dia
mati cepat in in what sense
apa car crash eh apa uh plane crash
apa apa juga pun kalau dah ajal like what you say lah
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay lah is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a um apa doktor badut dorang panggil um
no lah I think growing up I very you cannot decide lah nowadays also I also think about it kita we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
power ranger then I was like okay lah boleh lah power ranger but you know
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist pasal my gigi berterabuh
my gigi I think fall down and then uh I all of my front teeth semua macam
hitam tau like pasal I think it it was chipped and then after that ada ada darah stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
I think it was because I was sick then I realise ugh you know what if only I can become a doctor and then um I just got the idea from a lot people lah one thing I wanted to become scientist also pasal that time pergi madrasah then after that my ustazah cakap apa
err kalau ada lalat tu kan lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul
kepak dia tu kan satu one side kepak dia ada uh
what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other punya kepak tu ada
dia punya antidote penawar dia the medicines I want to say who ah I I'm curious ah
which side of the of the kepak of the lalat tu yang mana satu toxic yang mana satu what
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I kena punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
so dia cakap macam eh macam cool eh korang apa ni what you do performance and I enjoy that lah but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
pasal to get into medicine here at that time ah for me you need to get straight four A's
geram seh but anyway ya
so ya lah and err I remember my teacher you know mister yaz telling me to like eh bila ya lah where are you going to
just drop one subject lah just drop one subject because they were they care so much about apa ni dia punya school punya standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible lah so ya but then in the end I just decided to
this person tak boleh ajar ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say eh you are actually quite good ah uh
ya tapi tu tu show ada banyak problem seh
but the problem also not not not related to me lah pasal dia punya management lah they don't know how to sell the show they making lots of money even now you know a lot of people uh some of the
macam last time also I was pakai fikir apa tu alah nak buat like I always have this embarrassment tau kalau everytime kita buat show kan
how much to sell the tickets for then when you sell ticket alamak macam too much lah too expensive lah like I don't think people will want or like cannot afford cannot afford because we will we care about
the uh apa tu
bila kita calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even err we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay macam
you'll get loss lah rugi ah
okay noted tiga puluh minit oh wow
cannot decide ah kalau makanan makanan nak kena lit ah
dia teh tarik is always my actually I'm addicted to teh tarik it cannot kalau tak ada tak ada the teh tarik cannot
like even kalau
kat india okay lah not bad ah that time I was in bangalore
dorang kan ada dorang punya apa tu yang masala chai so and things like that so okay lah itu kelakar because
kecil kecil so I always like tak cukup I have to keep on buying and buying and buying later so in the end I came I said oh I saw they have this bigger cup for other drinks ah terus cakap can I have
boleh because dia dia tak ada the pricing tau for that thing so they just like anyhow give me a price so I said I don't mind then the next day I said even that not enough I brought my own water bottle I want your masala chai in my water bottle
chai just means tea that's why when we play scene when you when you say chai tea eh siapa tu
oh kita pause
kejap as we pick up some delivery
okay sambung balik
banyak distraction lah delivery lah
kau punya phone jangan mati eh dia okay ah
apa aku cakap oh ya okay lah so I think kalau makanan what favourite food I will eat
okay lah kalau drink teh tarik kalau makanan I don't know
I like nasi ambeng but I don't think I can eat nasi ambeng hari hari
buat selama-lamanya mm oh maybe okay lah kalau okay kalau nak fikirkan right I think
if I were to really strategise it something yang healthy
I don't know maybe protein shake ah not protein shake lah the one the one yang ada all the all the meals like
it's for survival dia macam okay you remember you watch matrix you know the yang dorang makan benda apa benda tu
then the guy was saying like um they were in the they were in a vessel uh but then after that they will makan some like some bubur or like porridge ke apa benda
dia cakap oh this is all this is everything that you need for your health that thing ah
um nasi ambeng maybe uh I don't know
for lunch nasi ambeng ah maybe something else
okay let's see what other prompts dorang kasi
promosi oh promosi beli satu percuma satu apakah yang paling teruk okay
ya lah maksudnya kalau macam
eh kau kan dulu kecil kecil ada belajar tu
hmm apa benda tak elok
dia ada batin batin ada dia kan ada kat masjid en-naeem kan
like that you bilang you bilang ibu ah
tengok ah
I also not so sure pasal to me dia macam nampak macam dancing
haven't melayu semua melayu silat
apa tak explain sikit
buka bunga apa open open flower open flower
so it's about really respect lah adat adat adat
okay then kalau martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
apa eh
the flying the flying arm bar I remember dia ajar macam mana nak buat flying arm bar
ni masih uni ah I think because
doing merepek-merepek stuff
because I did I do film school right so he study apa tu
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps ah then I okay then aku more to learn lah then he show me a flying arm bar
ya ya ya so macam mana I got the video ah choreo but I remember it was uh
like ya ya so you you hook on to the tangan and then after that one of the kaki will
ya gitu sekali banyak kali ah that move actually they look a lot dekat apa tu what a lot of the fightings sequences lah that kind of hollywood
pasal okay so now eh do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know uh I was baca lah pasal okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you ah kalau macam all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend ah think of uh somebody you jumpa every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person tanya okay ayisha uh can I uh macam stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
eh oh okay gitu jer eh
kalau an asker
they know dorang tahu yang apa tu if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
two weeks macam
not as lama lah but they will say like how how could this person even
how dare they ask me like that question asal dia tak fikir pasal so there's a lot of like issues that come with it pasal
you either macam
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks dia macam kurang ajar lah very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
got the hull invert um because they think like ada
but for so that's a point on guesser lah so I realised kita
there's a yes or no um people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why ah apa motive kau eh what is it for faham tak
um macam for example lah
uh oh aku perasan apa yang you leave your
that that apa tu yang
if it is a western country I think boleh lah
but they don't understand apa tu yang
uh dorang tak faham
impian eh
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk apa ni
it's okay sekiranya anda harus menyerah segala-galanya bagi mengejar impian anda apakah yang akan anda risikokan malay>kau ni melayu dia
ah aku tahu melayu tak we don't speak like that what
wait kalau kita cakap bahasa melayu kan
pasal maybe
I okay this is what I learn lah melayu yang kita belajar dekat sekolah is not
is not the melayu
in conversation melayu ah
siapa seh cakap macam gitu
tapi no actually okay kita
I mean I I got ada kawan I do speak melayu tau I do speak malay with um
uh cuma with the bahasa the like the language yang bahasa melayu yang kita pakai
ah no no kita tak pakai bahasa baku pun kita pakai bahasa I don't know they call it bahasa pasar ke but they is like
macam mana like it's not
it's not the language yang kita belajar in school
then I also wonder kita belajar bahasa tu dari mana
uh aku rasa wishes ni mesti lebih realistik lah tak boleh yang merepek-merepek lah okay kalau realistik wishes aku rasa aku nak get rich lah one of it lah one of it maybe untuk get rich
the reason aku nak kaya pasal actually err aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan
then kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi fit ah aku nak jadi fit aku fit aku rasa macam aku pergi lari ah err dekat bedok reservoir ke macritchie ke I feel that uh my body feels good lah so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
superpower okay so err we are moving from realistic to not so realistic ah okay so superpower kalau boleh aku nak teleportation teleportation kalau tengok cerita X men eh dia sikit-sikit macam night crawler
err so kalau teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
um to a certain extent pasal lah tu err bila teleportation okay kononnya tak ada teleportation eh macam sekarang ni
kita dah kena expose more err how should I say it uh more unknowingly for example kita naik kita squeeze squeeze dekat
kalau kita squeeze squeeze naik atau naik taxi grab driver ke taxi driver ke ah kita expose in that uh area kita duduk kat dalam ke kat dalam kereta ke
untuk beberapa minit ini ah ada yang research cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang
jadi kalau ada measure measure contohnya macam uh sanitisation
let's say nak pergi giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
and I rest at work and exposed again ini tak boleh kalau kita dah teleportation teleportation kita skip all the buses ni semua ah all the transportation ini exposure
ah tak kan begitu
but then when this err banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan mm apa ni orang kata
kena pergi kursus ah kursus-kursus um macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer
menggunakan aplikasi word excel kenapa teknologi telah berubah
jadi mereka dah behind time so ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin okay kut
okay lah eh jap err kita err
saya teringat something ah yang pasal teleportation ah kita uh ni eh reverse sikit ah eh teleportation eh kononnya teleportation ni kan boleh kita boleh teleport
um bila kita umur sepuluh tahun
uh kira-kira ni macam so called macam time machine begitu ah uh macam advance yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya invention tapi tak tahu lah dah ada ke tidak ni
uh jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh teleport reverse time eh maybe kita teleport ten years old
nak cakap apa dengan awak punya uh diri tu okay kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia
err salah satu err experience yang aku pernah mengalami ah adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit lah ah tapi dia real ah

you know now COVID nineteen right so macam banyak
ya I don't want to find like some kerja itu semua
can freelance but I also can like you know I can kerja like under a creative studio or
what should I do because when it's COVID nineteen semua benda macam
semakin menurun so I've been thinking about internship
because I'm I do macam you know the video ambil ambil video kat kat video ah I do like
poster poster buat buat poster but for their events
but it's just that my designs macam I my direction
not how to say ah macam
tak ya bagus bagus design sangat it's just
lesser design elements so macam tak berapa
I were to be versatile or what I think I need to like macam gain experience
closer closer to what I'm what I want to do lah you know what I mean like magazine editorial ke apa ke you know
ya ya but like mm it's a bit hard especially COVID nineteen lah like what I'm saying macam dah dah ada ni penyakit semua it's like it's hard to even go out it's hard to
that are related to my career it's more to like macam survive ah like tak ada duit you know like you know like now like
err I feel quite sad lah like sekarang zaman sekarang our our like generation like
survival ya so you just take whatever lah ambil jer like what else
masak masak kan ah ah masak masak so like even now your I feel like your industry also kena affected mah
what what we the future future contain cause like I feel like COVID nineteen kan kan dia teach you how to humble down and like
around you at the moment so like live the moment you know ya macam kalau you plan your jauh pun then your plan not
go to plan then like you will feel upset something then macam nak give up gitu kan so
I just hope for the best but not too much don't expect too much that kind of thing but like I feel like if we do out best in in anything I think boleh lah boleh lah we can make it lah
ya budak budak sekarang like okay I would say like now there's a lot of like
there's a lot of new things maybe like new food or what that kind of thing like for example bazaar you know this ramadhan can't go like mosque or what
yes it's also affected kan so macam a lot of
and like how to say I feel so macam deprived gitu macam tak ada orang nak cakap it's not that I
aku selalu actually middle actually aku ambivert ah
aku actually ambivert but basically I choose if I want to
like but now I prefer to be alone ah but it's just the people that I macam nak
siapa siapa yang I'm close to I want to just just meet them like okay I have a few other friends with it I think like I'm sure you
ya so macam ya now I'm introverted and I'm not mad about it but it's just that
since we're in our house macam kita kat duduk kat rumah kan it's more like oh sometimes we are so blinded macam
more changes to more ya progress to like macam make singapore more
like the quality semua ke apa kan like more err out there
macam kau yes correct correct
macam tak like tak ramai sangat yang
setuju um I don't know what I'm talking ah but like they don't agree
ingrained already it's like oh eh um aku dah apa I'm already like brought up this way from my
parents I need to be this way that kind of thing so they're a bit stubborn macam
degil sangat lah you know what again but I really hope that
they start to macam open up sikit and then more or less
what rakyat you know caring you know like I hope singapura macam
I don't know economic macam image you know like how macam singapore nak
that like banyak banyak gaps a lot of gaps
so aku lapar sial aku lapar sial like
you know I'm lapar I don't know what to eat also
but it was not bad and I found out that it's actually halal because the the is new
there's no halal sign so I asked actually halal it's just that it's processing the
now you just kau dah apa kau dah shift aku punya ah mindset sekarang to pasta
ya I don't know uh macam dah lama sangat
that one is like kita punya own timing punya break
I'm not a person who'd bangun pagi oh my god
I want to because is it yang mcgriddles tu dah dah
sedap seh I feel it's very nice eh but I'm like

floorball stick is softer the grip so ya my hand bengkak
ah I swear aku tak boleh shoot sial aku tak boleh shoot
it will never be a high shot macam shot or low shot gitu so I was so frustrated because the rest could do it
because okay basically kan floorball is macam yang banyak perempuan lawa lawa semua

but if you had a chance to like like you know like now people do the urban dance get kind of thing maybe like that kind macam gempak pun apa
oh the slow kind ah yang ni macam yang macam you know the ones that the choreography is like
ah kalau hip hop ke gitu okay ah you like you like you
it's that one takes time to appreciate it tak apa tak apa
rugged ah type macam rugged ah
oh tak kisah sangat ah
a bit err just macam sikit ah
then sekarang kau kau nak plan plan pergi university tak
macam mana nak cakap gigs gitu
I need to macam start from the bottom media and not
ya ya ya that's true that's true kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus kau bagus macam
kau boleh buat banyak benda kau boleh adapt adapt adapt adapt adapt
then kau belajar belajar sekali
but like but that's the thing though I think macam singapore kan dia orang they have like this emphasis on macam
kau mesti bagus at everything but like let's say
architecture okay then you major but nanti they say oh no you have to have good record
now that I think of it last time kan we always macam
oh aku nak jadi orang kaya then when you rethink about it now macam maybe I don't want to be a rich person
under under under under under us lagi you know like this so it's like
ah mata merah
apa bersefahaman eh why is does that sound like a paper kind of
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
oh cannot lah that one is too gila okay maybe I start first
if I got three hajat the first one would be I want to talk to my kucing
cause because I just like like every time I always like talk to my kucing and then I I become like a gila person and I like berbual merepek I legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if I if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
but macam fun lah
alamak if macam tu then
but I want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
like kalau I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya I tak nak apa tu I don't want to travel to the future
cause I takut that if I see macam what my future is
macam I risau lah that my what my actions will
oh ya that's true but okay example lah if if in the future I see that I become doctor and then abeh I I don't know I
okay no no no change change change okay in the future I see that I'm something that I don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then I'll be like oh okay okay ah try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now lah and then macam tak ada thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay lah later I become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
tapi fun lah
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that oh kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup lah tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then I fikir also like betul lah
but if I tidur
sikit sangat also I also ngantuk
ya ya I understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
oh I faham
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh I think I think
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes lah okay not my ayah my ibu
ya I a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah lah
and cut down on the gula-gula
oh wait no maggi goreng
no ada indomie and maggi eh mi sedaap
actually I last time legit suka eh ibumie
ya sedap but then
I don't know why everyone say indomie so I like oh oh okay okay sama sama lah indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
it's like lain sikit
mi sedaap they legit like tak lokek their bawang
but their bawang a bit macam
weird lah cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's I don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
kan maybe it's like bawang but
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
oh I tadi I eat uh briyani
okay lah tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
daging I don't like
what the wait they jual where
I I want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
I feel like pelan-pelan I will I will adapt to it
and like what you know during the time I go up to to to aqil to ask for the gambar
and then imagine I I tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me I'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
actually takde power yang
yang I don't know
is ada hikmahnya that
um ada udang sebalik ini semua
tak pernah eh
I legit tak pernah dengar
apa eh let me think
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik lah if you don't already have it
what is the one okay wait I read in malay also okay sabar sabar eh
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
alasan that is paling like is okay
I can think of one alasan that is very remeh
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah eh tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham kan ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek lah
kan kan macam nak sepak jer kan
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
wah that one I tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
apakah genre drama atau rancangan yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent um drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
I think I faham a bit
is it macam
okay it's not really genre lah but okay as you know lah I suka like anime like recently like I watch a lot of anime
like why I like anime is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! I don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu lah but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya lah like anime
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham lah it's like
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the anime their their plot macam very exciting and very fun lah cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
kan macam
eh just ask me I can tolong ask rina also
I added I follow your adik and she legit so funny
oh my god my adik also you know my adik is like like very young
and he type macam legit like budak zaman sekarang like you know you know how you type macam oo whoa whoa
and the thing is he's a lelaki you know so when like sometimes I I tengok they way he type or he hantar me message and I legit sometimes macam a bit disgusted
ya and and his macam ejaan is lain you know like you know when you um eja like no is N O he eja like N U U U U U so it's nuuuuu
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat lah kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
if duit is percuma then
I want mm I want bubble tea to be percuma
then I can rasa I can rasa all the different flavours
because sekarang I just keep buying the brown sugar fresh milk
you know I baru beli the sandals right
and then tadi I keluar lah I went ikea and apa tu it was like a bit scary cause I don't know I don't know why like when I pakai the sandals it feels like like high heels or something
ya ya and I takut it will cabut so I was like I was like trying to macam walk slowly and it looks a bit weird my mother was like eh jalan betul-betul lah
don't know cause apa tu sebelum tu I had uh one pair of rubi shoes and it actually like lasted quite lama lah
ya cause kadang-kadang it's only until forty
that's a bit kesian
oh oh my god I benci when when like they always look at me like I want to curi something
if it's just what like how I'm acting I think I was acting macam biasa jer
tapi legit menyampah
maybe they kena force to do it
actually kan if they if they tak cakap welcome then that means they just diri kat situ and stare at you so maybe that's why they welcome welcome
oh I did I did okay apa ah I actually just bought like baju
and seluar and kasut ah cause like tak ada banyak benda that I need and I
I'm actually cause I look at my wardrobe and like I got so many baju that I don't really pakai all the time
and it's like I simpan it's just cause I simpan cause I sayang you know I don't want to I don't want to buang
then I keep macam telling myself dah tak apa lah next time can use but
I don't actually pakai it lah so so I like
chose some baju that I want to give away and I'm giving away to rina cause she
she tanya lah ya and then but from eleven eleven ah what
I bought two jeans one white one black then I also beli ah two blouse ya one white and then is another blouse and then I also bought skincare which is apa tu ya
ya ya correct and the kasut lah
the hitam one the kasut is actually very nice
I actually nak pergi typo cause I want to buy some stuff from typo
ya tapi macam jauh ah cause I baru eh I pindah right
I pindah like from last two years I used to live nearer to like JEM but now I live like nearer to jurong point
ya if you naik the lah
you mean lampu raya
I want to apa tu volunteer
but like you know I tadi I went to the volunteer dot website and like most of the places like the volunteer places are like at the east eh
eh I I tak faham why I always so penat
like I sleep for apa like dua belas jam also I still can be so penat
wait you bangun pukul berapa
so actually I bangun pukul I bangun pukul lapan and then I
uh I tried to do stuff until pukul dua belas then pukul dua belas I went out mm I went out to ikea
macam chemical
entah it's like cause it's soya right
oh oh it used to it used to be apa tu from macam animals ah like dairy products but then now they change it to vegan
then macam tak sedap lah
ya actually macam takde apa-apa nak buat kat situ
tapi tadi I went there right and there was only like families
macam takde takde orang pergi dating ke takde budak-budak
mmhmm kan eh we also going skating right I a bit takut cause I tak tahu macam mana nak skate and then
okay dulu lah when I was like kecil like very young long time ago I I use the skates like the the that skates lah the fat one the wheels are very fat right
ya and then I jatuh you know and then I didn't skate anymore
no no no it's the roller blade the apa tu the roda is tajam right but then the skate the skating the indoor skating that we're going is the roda is like roundish and fat
so I a bit takut to go skating
I just tarik all of you down
I I think the the apa tu yang the round wheels right is harder to balance
ya cause like example ah you diri and then if you diri too straight then you can jatuh eh
ya you can jatuh backwards or if you sandar right you can jatuh also that's how I jatuh last time
oh my god I don't even kemas my bilik
I want to beli you know the like the mirror that is like panjang
but I also want to install you know kipas on the wall cause my kipas now is kat lantai
like cause I need to tarik my kipas everywhere cause
I'm panas then sometimes tertrip on the wire over the wire ya and my kipas also tak kuat sangat
cause now our window grille kan like we need to pasang the the mesh if not like our kucing can escape
ya so we want buy the grille that is like tak besar sangat so the kucing can like no need cannot escape lah
and we no need to pasang the mesh cause now like we all the windows got the mesh
ya no no no it's only the top and then the mesh like tangkap all the bulu
ya so we malas to bersihkan so we just change the window
eh when we keluar on the nineteen we should go to fatburgers
fatburgers ya is a apa tu sign
I think huda want to makan fatburger
no but apparently it's sedap
kat ang mo kio ada I think
oh ya kan kan tapi COVID so tak banyak ah
ya ya that time also I go then like a bit kosong and it was ya I think it was a weekend also cause usually banyak orang sampai tak boleh jalan or something ya but it was kosong ah
apa eh jap
you have one child but you have another one percuma oh
huh that's that's a bit gila
actually twins twins a bit fun when you grow up how many anak you want to have
your apa tu parents very cute
I mean they still muda
my my ibu and ayah they kahwin when they were twenty eight
ya and it's actually my my ibu still schooling cause she
she join like madrasah lambat lah and then she want to like continue islamic studies
so like like she like she never even kerja after she kahwin eh after she kahwin pula she never kerja after she like belajar
so after she belajar which is like she finish twenty eight then my ayah already macam apa simpan duit for how many years already so he sponsor everything
he sponsor the majlis the honeymoon all and then they kahwin at twenty eight but then they ambil like four years to get like my abang
so like they got my abang at thirty two
and you know they tunang for how long
they tunang for six years
dekat huh ya usually orang tunang apa dua tahun
eh I want to kahwin someone baik someone baik someone kacak someone
kalau boleh lah tapi tak boleh kan takpe
can ask nabilah nabilah got buat tu before
you want to berhenti here
how cause I very like macam my friends also like I buka ah
continue ah your story curi how how did he get away with that
the audacity adik curi daripada bapa
macam mana you dapat though
I think some kedai like some shop they will ask some shops tak kesah that one best kalau like if your muka then they like ya ambil lah wah
how I cannot I don't know like I got like macam masih you know ya
like I go I my I sprained my ankle then got like headline fracture then I kind of cannot play sports now then like I feel very insecure like you know because the thing is right macam pasal body like when you are like bigger in size but then you you play sports or what but then when you play sports what did I say oh ya then I stop ah cause I fracture then like the thing is like you know when you are bigger in size
and then but then like when you tak buat apa-apa then like they will just keep on attacking you the same you know like just now we talked about all the aunties seventy year old is like what the hell dude but then you like when you have something macam like if you dance dance is also a sport right or play other sports they will like not say or like you can will just skip one or thirty you wanted to say you know like just now we talk about
say something back but then ya makcik makcik sekarang tak tahu like ya they not it's like bukan tegur it's like menyindir then I'm like wow oh really ah your parents like that
especially in front of other relatives tu aku sakit hati betul oh my god correct not even secretly that is oh my god ya
I am not saying why but like I rarely meet my friends or like girls in general that want motor right ya most of them nak kereta I mean like ya oh sorry I don't know what I mean I don't understand like
then he like at least you got there ya so sorry ah I quite shocked ah but alhamdulillah at least he got there I mean macam token you got hear that before the token malay like what were we talking about again
I heard people are not like some other girls cannot take it then like you know you just risau then like if talking about the context as a female but like if you are also not gonna say cause you are under a superior macam tukar macam sergeant kau then kalau nak buat benda like he can macam threaten you
ya okay I think I agree also but then the thing is I'm not trying to say that we are as women are not strong or what it's just like K we can macam move on to the topic of like the whole like sexism misogynistic ideology in singapore like do you do you nampak the news baru keluar like ah this chinese man
dia freaking like molest budak kecil perempuan and like upskirt and then he just got like seven months probation the thing is macam kalau nak cakap pasal sexual cases like harassment kat singapore the government just like turns a blind eye towards it like why is the system so whack
I've never seen a muslim like righteous of para muslim say that like alah but then like maki alah also like did you see the french people right that was like
ya the thing is like cause french they are trying to reach like circularism macam dia tak nak apa-apa religion at all kat dalam dia orang country or tak nak individualism kat dalam country dia orang also dia orang tak nak ah tudung semua tak nak which I don't understand because other people from other religion macam nuns tu semua
because they tutup also right I'm not saying they shouldn't also I'm saying like why the double standards macam kita orang tak boleh dia orang boleh and then the french the macaron you know the french cookie the president ya dia kata dia tak suka hijab cause we look scary
but then like as much as we understand do you see the thing with us is right I'm not saying like I'm not saying we are greater than them but like muslims we endured so much and like we've been we are the most oppressed religion but we understand and respect the fact that they cannot understand our religion but they cannot give us an ounce of respect that just infuriates me a lot lah macam aku boleh err macam hormat kau punya agama asal kau tak boleh hormat kau tak faham pun the very least you can do is just give us respect
they don't even no the thing is that they are so ignorant dia orang tak kesah but the thing is even if you tak kesah or like don't care just leave us alone there's no need oh really but the thing is they don't care I think is not they don't care they just hate us for some god damn reason I don't understand why
ya I think cause of our agama also cause you know nabi muhammad he say cannot hate anybody and you respect I think a lot agama and morales also I just don't understand why why do they hate us but
singapore is so sheltered honestly seeing as to what is happening in like all over the world kita dalam bubble and like do you see how many people are like I'm not saying they are dumb but I think we are like so selesa and comfortable dalam singapore then when you like tak kesah
I'm not saying you but like you know some malays like they say the N word and apa lagi like just perangai dia orang ah I'm wanna believe is adolescence but macam bodoh apa like kalau kau tengok balik they end up what the fuck I'm not supposed to say that
like what was I doing back then you know I don't know the new generation of mak minah scares me ya scare me like dulu dulu is not this bad like honestly in my opinion like right now even though last time got gang fight or what is like never serious in my opinion ah tapi sekarang macam I see them like throwing maki ah mak kau
mak kau ya is just uncomfortable lah to tengok like the younger generation
is very sedih ya macam kalau cause the thing is um like the older generation tak nak pergi I'm not saying
that we're gonna like you know right when the time comes it comes but then is gonna be our turn to lead and then we kalau kau tengok the younger generation aku macam err like you know just sad to see I'm not saying we are all bad
apa dia buat ni ah
honestly I don't even think you are a minah you just look like a normal malay like ya
ya you see the thing is with a lot of muslims nowadays they fikir just because then they feel macam
judge you and then when they want to say something or like like to say something ah is not even tegur is like sindir like asal kau I'm like um sorry sally like like you know like asal kau pakai tertutup asal kau I'm like um I'm trying my best you know like the way they tegur is it comes off very like offensive maybe it's just us I don't think I don't think I'm that sensitive
some people like please please others just because they want something but then I think like there's a difference between like pleasing someone to jaga hati or pleasing someone to get them to be your friend on games or something like that that's like very different though but sometimes I think people get mixed up about it
like just because I told you this and then you ungkitkan balik I hate it when people do that like when I tell you something and then you just suddenly bring it up again even though I did not mean it in that context macam apa ni bodoh like no like like I would say the younger generation that is cause
I mean the older generation I can tolerate a bit ah a bit sometimes they a bit too proud ah of what they are you don't have to ya they don't have to bring themselves up ya they bring us down to bring themselves up macam dulu aku kecil-kecil how ah I don't know lah
wow congratulations wow masuk jannah esok but I've met some people that dia orang err like hafal al quran all that until like not say fluent or what I'm not sure that's what they are trying to do but it comes off that way or maybe I tersinggung sikit sebab I tak boleh hafal but like you know there's no need to
I come after you eh aku baru habis khatam tau kau tukar ke tak kau kat masjid mana macam like wow and usually is like not saying what ah but is the madrasah kids pun macam gitu ya and then they
eh I don't know cakap bahasa arab aku macam okay thanks oh my god ya oh my god ya is it like sometimes aku like just fikir and talk about these stuffs
like deep down I will ask myself is it caused by cemburu or what but honestly honestly I no you know
but like macam it just like sakit hati the way they talk to us is like that
then then like you don't like skip the drills and then you continue like then you khatam like you know there's some people that go to some extend in order to macam rasa bagus sebab dia yang not even about quran or what like just in life general macam
dia lari empat round you you baru lari dua round then you just say oh I finished eight rounds macam gitu you know like the competitiveness and like ya I think is like
how you act on it also apa dia buat pasal tu dia dia yang vlogging vlogging tu kan okay
I only have one girl friend that ada lesen motor and she bawa scooter ya comel bodoh and is very is the lah like I think morgan I'm not very familiar with motor but I think what is that ah
okay sorry I didn't know it's comel at least you will come to school and like like that but I think like hujan a bit difficult though ya mm ya but how hard like how I have friends who have like motor the besar one just like five K starting price
wow dah fikir jauh sister
mm ah inshallah actually study like last month you know COVID COVID the thirty five guest should have went for it lagi murah really I have like some friends and cousins actually only a friend and two cousins
kahwin during so they only invite dua puluh lima orang then the others like online it was like cheap not cheap ah but like compared to what the malays you know malay weddings are so expensive sis you dah save you wanted to get married twenty two
kalau ada jodoh then it will happen
but wow I'm betul-betul cannot believe that you like dah plan I'm like wow cause like bila cakap online like you're eighteen I'm like cool she's still a student too I'm like she's still around that eighteen age wow
wait you ambil berapa course kat mana how much is it ah I heard private course like expensive what did you sit for like apa you belajar
same same industry also um how you cari course like this oh
but I think like your course and dia punya timing betul-betul chun like cause of the pandemic betul-betul cari like orang apa ni like healthcare people ya they cari ya ya so that was the timing was nice but the pandemic no lah
tak nak try hospital like oh okay okay
oh that's a bit leceh
untuk kahwin okay okay sorry sorry
is he oh no not reservist right oh okay okay sorry sorry I mean how old is your that one oh okay okay kat tekong
yeah oh okay is that a lot I have friends that habis satu kotak like one kotak per day like how what the fuck oh wow isn't it like mahal because I have friends also they pokgai pun masih nak beli rokok
ya then kalau tak pinjam I don't understand the
pinjaming the satu batang satu batang thing it's so funny like halfway through class satu batang K minggu depan okay
cause like my family is don't smoke like my parents tak smoke langsung then when I masuk poly then I'm like to me culture shock cause um none of my friends like close friends smoke but poly oh my god everybody whenever you turn somebody is smoking and like
wow aku macam quite shock nampak dia orang as kelakar to me but like to them is a norm but dah biasa is so cute like minggu depan aku bagi kau balik like wow
comel that's legit selling seh I never see the photo legit wow smart smart no ah no lah
oh my god then they tell the anak-anak look down look down lower your gaze tutup mata scary seh oh man ya
I know some girl friends will be like chill sister I do not want your mat tahir
anak siapa tu astaga
same like like rilek-rilek ya ya macam sendu ours apa sia minah-minah ni
then like they refunded to me aku malas nak register balik and then now online registration got registration fee like online fee I think it's like three dollars or four dollars aku macam I don't want lah I gemar cara
but private mahal ya motorbike but actually I learn how to I don't think is illegal cause my family has like houses like in indonesia then we also have family there then sometimes we just ride the motor there like they teach us lah so technically
I can bawa already I mean if you is this going to be used against me but in singapore I have friends who takde lesen then they just bawa motor they just bawa as long as you tak kena tangkap
I'm not trying to teach you or what but I have friends lah like you know they just bawa takde lesen as long as you tak tangkap is okay takut risky
no but you can beli motor tak lesen
can like my friend no err family member that can pay you see my friend um jual his motor to this kid he haven't even get his license
then he dah dah letak nama dia bayar dah dah ambil dah budak tu I don't know if he has his license already lah but at first when he beli takde I don't know how he gonna learn also cause of like circuit breaker last time but at least he is learning now
but ya but don't lah don't it's illegal illegal don't do illegal things you smoke like cold or hot ya I can smell it why honestly bila my friends cakap pasal ni aku tak but they said got the feeling the feeling
they said hot sakit berat berat is it what you say heavier ah
but you know one brand like gudang garam that one like gold mine cause I don't know how my friends got it but they like bawa ke sekolah and then they spread ah ya like I don't know how they supply dapat like that day budak ni bawa tu macam
you know when they jual it then that thing you know then dia kasi kasi orang I don't know if they beli or what ah but I'm just like very curious macam mana korang dapat ni semua especially when they are underage and then beli
I mean eh that's a huge flex eh you want to like minum bandung I want to drink bandung in bandung like wow I mean if
you had the money like takde feeling there ah makan french fries kat singapore
you want like just keep quiet right and then tiba-tiba segan takutkan dia orang why is it quiet ah
kelakar bodoh aku tiba-tiba like ah budak ni tak nak kasi duit mm mm inshallah
kasi surprised kasi us another surprise
tapi feel like banyak though on the other side apa sia budak-budak ni
I mean who doesn't duit tu siapa tak nak though
podcast though like in singapore is very like the podcast that are available in singapore is very niche semua nak buat like orang cina-cina you know like the youtubers siapa ni I don't watch them but I think they have podcast and is so like damn I feel lah in singapore when I look at podcast I have never seen or I haven't come across
broadcast melayu like in english but then by malay people
like not about religion because most of the podcast I see if it's singaporean right there's like religion aspect to it maybe if you want to start then you start ah then you have that you occupy that spot but I don't know err malay podcast usually talk about agama like a lot of it
I pusing so no lah eh I only ever seen like those ya but that one is like tiga puluh sen like you can buy it at the convenient store ya ya ya that one you pass around your friends
lighter kau ada lighter tak lighter aku dah habis ya that's the thing I hear a lot also
no like again with the race I'm not trying to pull the race card all the time when I'm talking but like I don't know I just tak nampak banyak orang melayu yang mungkin aku tak baca berita harian ke apa tapi I feel like all the
newspaper propaganda so I don't even bother looking at it but aku tak dengar banyak macam success story for melayu that's like wow you know
mm I think the latest entrepreneurial I heard about is like this chinese couple they start like a pet grooming service ya untuk anjing ah I mean that's for them ah that's a niche for them but like aku tak dengar pasal melayu pun asal kita punya community diam jer
kan kan aku rasa dia orang dengar macam bosan though
no I think like when we send it to them then dia orang akan dengar and I think cause cause the video they show dalam form like changing changing the code switching that one I think they akan belajar to like analyse the way we cakap
interesting ah macam I think this is something only bilingual people do I mean no shit lah how can one person with only one language do it what you know but then I've never heard of a chinese person speak in chinese in mandarin and english like campur is usually one one like ya around me lah is like very rare and like
most of my chinese friends don't even speak mandarin cause they hate mandarin I don't know why ya some of them hate the bahasa ibunda I'm like bro
ya betul betul
aunties or what will come up to me and ask me how to get to a place in mandarin K like I understand a bit only but after that aku tak faham kau nak aku buat apa I get so like at first confused but then like cause before I wore hijab
I I look like a chinese like ya I don't like it cause one time I got offered bak kwa before I'm like 我是马来人:wo shi ma lai ren no bak kwa for me no oink oink for me sweetie
but like the err chinese aunties they will like literally like look at you for you to stand up ya ya then I'm like I'm like no no especially if kalau tu bukan apa ni reserve seat why the why should I ya you know is not entitlement right ya of course
not that not that crunchy right compared to but still very nice especially the kentang the whipped potato
okay lah tak tak sedap sangat ah to my taste
okay lah both I think preference wise I tak choosy ah both
sedap very crunchy very nice I think it depends on your mood hari tu kalau you rasa your taste
ah okay lah christmas eve lah christmas christmas dah nak dekat seh nak boleh order dia punya christmas bundle I'm looking for turkey ataupun lamb shank
the halal lamb shank sedap seh but then now I don't see ah lamb shank
I only see the meat loaf and lamb rack I want the shank macam
oh that's very nice apa
ah dia punya cake not bad I'm looking forward for the christmas for the thanksgiving
sayang seh I don't think so there's christmas
tak boleh buat gathering pe because of this COVID nineteen
thanksgiving nampaknya kena postpone ah
iya lah lepas tu tak boleh
buat gathering seh ramai-ramai

mask we can collected tak tahu eh kat vending machine nearest vending machine nearer to our home
oh like that then good lah at least we got the new masks to use seh mask kita semua dah macam very ah lunyai
you shouldn't be washing in washing machine hand wash and and dry because you keep washing the same I mean the mask kita dapat

satu bilik seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
sebab tempat dia kat woodlands

so like two thousand eight abeh dah tu you convert the money to malaysia
ah tak payah kerja seh
okay so like rumah kan dia ada ninety nine years lease
so kalau freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
jadi dia macam forever and ever jadi
let's say ada anak cucu cicit
then dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada the rumah
then they can just like rent the rumah then they can just buy another house because it's like
like they have like macam a certain like oh you can only okay if let's say you are a diploma then you can only earn like two five
two five abeh you need to expect to buy a house with the two five
so ya like macam susah seh and you like
apa namanya apa after diploma ah degree
ya after degree abeh setakat macam dapat like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight
why I mean like sedih you know like cause some people like they don't have the money to even pay for a degree
abeh dah tu like you expect like
kita to hustle sama
untuk macam dapat the same
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house tapi ni macam
sebab kita punya level is lain
so macam
buat cantik ah resume tu buat cantik cantik swee swee ke
degree is like macam dia punya baru punya in thing tau

eh but I think like the trend kan sekarang is like
semua orang boleh jadi independent like girl dengan girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it ah and then after that then err kalau macam
nak slack off
so I think the zaman dah berubah change already
now zaman sekarang orang
like perempuan like like girls
the guy's pride the maruah of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's tak boleh avoid
for satu for one person to kerja
macam mana nak cakap macam sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
tapi commission pun tak stable seh
satu hari like you can like satu bulan you can only earn like macam tiga ribu abeh the next bulan you earn lima ribu
lagi like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
then macam wah so difficult that's why like I think susah kalau like you based on like
apa nama dia commission jer
tapi dia buat satu kerja jer pe
so so dia punya pay tetap dua ribu lima ratus atau the pay already
because sekarang dia ambil orang lain punya commission
abeh like
oh no okay so wait her pay dua ribu lima ratus
abeh dah tu kalau sebab sekarang dia ada commission kawan dia so how ever much the commission
of dia punya kawan let's say satu ribu then after that dengan dia punya satu ribu
oh okay okay faham faham
she untung ah
branches cawangan
okay faham faham faham faham
dia tu lah
tak ada hospitalisation leave eh
lagi banyak kerja lah
ah kalau let's say the future

cause like you know like mum thing you like if you want you wouldn't want to friend to like you know like macam to share the habitats defence
sometimes they have like parents like ada dia punya own wish
okay lah tak larang kalau dia nak buat buat lah kalau ada duit tak ada duit nevermind
nasib baik got save save kalau tak save then like teruk sia macam gitu
sabar after like a certain period of time ke apa

ya so kalau investment dia macam
okay so at the after twenty five years I keluarkan the duit

um aku tak gurau ni
mana you need to pandai cari lah you cannot obviously find those yang
apa tu yang what do you call that
you cannot you cannot go to a like a shop itself kalau shop tu ada brand it's definitely going to be expensive you need to buy something yang tak ada brand sebab okay if I tell you um chanel
a bag from chanel or a baju from chanel and a baju from H&M but it's the same exact baju it's the same exact colour however will there be a difference in price
abeh tak nak layan sia aku
wei aku macam nak buatkan rumah untuk coki
and then he like the circle carpet outside if you have saw it and then he also suka bilik mak aku
tahu ah
bilik mak aku a'ah dia dah romantic mood
eh kau ni dah kenapa tengok banyak sangat siao
blackout lah like opaque like eh windows pula astaghfirullahhalazim
ah sebab kau kan vampire
so your house is like just dua tingkat you know you look at my cat
no but then if you open the tingkap near your bilik it wouldn't be a problem right near your room
tapi our air freshener that right there is like an ioniser
tu the white colour thing the ioniser it it basically right it helps you remove all the bad and harmful macam bacterias in the air and then keluarkan the cool air
I cannot understand punya fame you know I realise something weird about me I like like groups that are not famous
he has like wow I know him badan dia like okay it's just something I would like to have you know asal ada benda yang memekak luar kat situ
I'm not saying maisonette is like atas bawah tau rumah dia macam rumah shafiq tu
I mean if you want if you want to have your own house isn't it macam you want your own space
why oh because you just live in your room eh sekarang dah terbiasa gitu lah oh okay okay faham faham
so ah rumah aku ni sebenarnya banyak buku tapi buku-buku ni semua dia untuk perhiasan aku tak baca pun
uh huh atuk aku ada kasih aku buku bila aku P three
cerita dia pasal kampung girl a'ah dia sebenarnya nak kena kahwin dengan siapa lah aku tak tahu
and then it got really complicated aku tak pernah habis baca sebab I find the character so cringey
and it's like macam about love and I'm like awkward reading a love story
but aku rasa kalau aku kasih ulfa she would like it I guess
ah about apa don't get me you know I feel like she has very high standards
macam even the like okay so that day I ask her like
what ah to jaga her atuk and nenek and then she said that her mother is currently working for jems I don't know but I think got out something
like that time ada thing but then in the end she managed to go also pe
ya lah ngok
serious ah asal
ah selalu gitu oh my god girl you want me to get started on christina and ulfa eh no salah nama christina and insha
so what happened is that they are keys team both are them ada boyfriend kan however the thing with insha is that she's for always with her boyfriend like twenty four hours with her boyfriend
so it's so weird sebab macam it goes to the extent that the netball cage key the cage key that the captain have to hold is with her boyfriend
and like macam okay so you're not do you follow them on instagram okay but anyway but if you do then they actually like macam you know how like friends and celebrity couple sometimes they get in a bad condition or situation they always like put up this act or show that's what okay insha did to christina so on like
she she said that macam kalau in terms of apa
and then I was like are you guys best friend I texted christina tapi ya that's not how it is
dan dan hari tu dia orang keluar together they did a double date lepas tu azhari didn't have money like I don't know I don't know why azhari didn't pay for it but then akif paid for it like christina punya boyfriend he paid for insha punya cable car ride

there see that guy macam that guy is the singapore social guy kan then she she was like
shu shu is my err my ex-colleague the one that is now working for berita harian as the
reporter actually the other day I I forgot lah that kak ain kan she just macam she just err wrote a new book right the java enigma
then after that she got the I err I was talking to her then like dia dapat the interview dengan berita harian right err
taking scraps ah from her colleagues so like quite I forgot about dia for a bit
oh ya anyway next time macam you kalau dengar like any like cool people or stories or people to interview ah just let me know ah then at least she has something to write about
okay so katakan dia is like twenty four twenty one years old twenty one years old
masih you will still consider
abang she's twenty one this year and you are twenty nine this year
katakan lah I I know someone who is twenty one years old this year and
anyway I was talking to kakak the other day she was asking whether she want to
belum but she she did tell me macam
err dia no lah dia ada make like ada make video lah like when she
um okay lah it's very big then dia ada macam err dua balconies two balconies
based on macam the video I saw it was macam dua dua balconies
I was talking to her then on the day yang err
kakak was err just mengumpat pasal dia punya
err mak mertua as per usual lah the usual err
topic of conversation between mummy kakak and the madrina
ya so then mummy was saying macam kakak is
the what's that anak mertua yang biadap I think that was the exact words err
that is a mm adjective to to describe kakak
but anyway err um remember kakak I was asking kakak when she
err celebrate hari raya in her current house
or celebrate hari raya in the next house because
eh no it should be may it should be may cause this year's hari raya was err dua puluh empat
I remember the hari raya was
dua puluh empat or dua puluh enam I think that was the
that was the official hari raya punya date
no lah as in just kakak was asking me lah macam mana cause
like kasi orang jalan jalan raya lah to her house
ya ya ya I I remember is the one yang abang yan dengan yang abang yan datang then he
yes yes is that is that one that one yang dia err minta kakak izin like err
kakak kata okay lah obviously but kakak was like cause what cause kakak couldn't say macam
no tak boleh datang kau tak boleh datang besok but like kakak was like okay
kenapa ni nak datang then I remember mum was saying macam dia tak ada barang tak ada benda lain tak buat apa
then macam why why then mum was telling the story of how he always goes to people's houses
ah ya ya I heard that he's doing it and cik anis is also doing it right was it
how old is abang yan again
suka hati eh abang just panggil orang gay eh
sangat deep
macam best sangat ke
bagus sangat ke ah ugh it doesn't happen in
there's macam everybody is more free and liberal in
for right okay I know that kalau you nak masuk kalau you nak dapatkan the hostel room right
yang the korean punya show yang dia orang taruk the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
kejar them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
like other celebrities have to chase them and cari I believe they have to pull the name tag off lah
she like it was very popular so I remember me and kakak we were saying that
but last time dia punya zaman also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball dengan football T-shirt
last time we used to have this err music teacher kat bowen ah his name was err mister jamal
like professional macam
dia punya club room he
either he's kekek like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers punya basketball punya like
ya so macam the husband must be really making serious money ah
macam tak masuk akal lah like
and it's not that there's anything wrong with kerja kerja lah but
you're so macam
supply chain abang a job that is quite a big need in singapore
exactly so macam tak masuk akal lah macam
those macam how they rank the
hundred shares bonds ah you have to like buy by the thousands ah if I'm not mistaken so macam you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
but ya lah it just doesn't makes sense to me that dah dah dah belajar susah-susah then macam
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that mamat the his boyfriend
he was quite against macam he liked to look down on a lot of this macam people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this macam
the halal version of jack's restaurant lah there was one at
it's the steak one I remember the there's a halal one made by this chef then he had a
I believe it is or it's just err something like jack's but it's halal
then the mother is back there then he is here lah then the father remarried then I think like the father macam
dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit lah like the father
like macam it doesn't make sense lah and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from wei xiang wei xiang told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
lemon yogurt you tak you tak ingat eh
you don't macam
macam bodoh lah macam don't don't jangan lah pakai your own freaking like
so so macam I was telling like him ah that
they they don't want to macam speak out against like gay people because like
like people don't want to macam oh actually she's a liar and all these ya
a lot lah I tell you right all these macam people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like dee kosh is quite stupid lah in my mind macam
you're famous kau famous macam like people know people people know your face then
kau buat macam gini macam you want to proposition right don't use your own account lah
pakai macam pakai fake account lah gini pakai your own account macam you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for macam like someone is
because macam
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to macam
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough macam
so same for dee kosh ah macam just because you you
doesn't like make it right lah you should own self macam
first of all right there is no budak zaman sekarang you and me right are difference by five years only
okay first of all right it's not budak-budak zaman sekarang there are people your age right
what rothschild what those other like err rockefeller and those macam
lauder the the family that still owns the that owns the Estee Lauder punya line the lauder family
all your shakes macam
so ya so macam
I'm a foodie so macam
you know what this reminds me okay no no no ingat tak mummy kan kata macam she said that
the I think wak nia right was just posting so much about her life on the like
WhatsApp group chat so mummy was saying macam sia annoying lah macam um kenapa nak buat macam gini
mm people yang yang nak attention lah yang yang yang gila gila attention so much ah that's what mum was saying macam
people yang like you know macam
huh they gila kan lelaki no macam they crazy for attention lah like they they
I I would be quite interested in like what is macam joe rogan's punya like
that he has fights to macam to announce ah like
what does he do like what is there macam preps that he have to do does he actually have to like research on
uh twenty nine but I tak terjun botol punya orang sebab I I don't know because that time I rasa macam I terjun botol when you actually uh proposed to me right I rasa macam like the happiest girl on earth lor then macam
macam semak because the thing is that um it's not very often for me to get um
I don't have boyfriends before I have like boyfriends like macam those people who idiots people lah but then uh
ya so our age was catching up so we feel like we old wah sudah tua mahu kahwin lagi ha ya so
I rasa macam I think this the right time for us to get married
but remember that time we kena kena tipu
the for our kad jemputan
to your mother also lah from actually stopped me also mak mak stopped me
I actually oh the next one the problem was uh the kalau the tak nak nyanyi eh tak nak show up we got the best tau he's the funniest guy the funniest guy ya quite popular he's she's actually
huh ya he want to back out because he said something like he not agree with the with the caterer lah then that caterer also say um I don't know lah he's like that lah the perangai macam apa lah gitu so I was like macam ah merepek seh perangai
ya attitude then ya I was like you're funny but then still attitude macam siak so macam uh eventually I
call I I try to find kat facebook tengok ada tak siapa-siapa so I found
then that kan so all the lagu semua lah ada lagu melayu semua all mesti ada dah ada pun dah bagus uh baju semua awesome but the only thing that I scared for all the weddings right
the whatever kan semua tak show up tak apa tapi caterer kalau tak show up wah
my mum will go crazy because the thing is that makanan apa kan ha orang datang tak ada makanan nak kasih apa maggi mee
ya macam lah
ya I mean um he he dia very professional lah professional dia tahu macam mana nak berbual dia tahu and dia tak ada macam menyakiti siapa-siapa di hati pun for ah because the reason is that my mum is under religious punya school studies so kalau
so kalau cikgu macam ada cikgu-cikgu ke ustazah-ustazah datang nanti my mum was like eh don't open like all these kind of song ah
ha so macam he understand like throughout truly lah everything semua dia faham semua so the was good
uh eventually the wedding turn out good and also caterer datang we got our photoshoot photographs semua
but eventually the only thing that we don't get back is yes kita punya video tak dapat balik so orang lain um tunjukkan video kat facebook after like what
two weeks kita sampai sekarang belum lagi tunjukkan video because we do not have the video ya we want to do again
yes correct then the things that bila I that's when I found out that macam
um actually I don't really care lah that's it's correct lah macam sedih kita tak dapat video tapi at that same time I say
video could be just a story then tapi I nak cerita I dengan you like forever punya cerita video so I say okay
I want to get my own video tapi sampai sekarang masih belum buat because my computer very slow
ya I know banyak tapi video um computer slow the things that all nak kena tunggu the computer baru datang baru boleh buat
ya the cuaca was nice because dia tak hujan tapi dia tak panas pun so it was just that perfect moment
but for me I have regret I have like a lot of regrets actually for the wedding um because that wedding kan um I like my wedding betul but
back then I would actually definitely go to orange ballroom orange ballroom punya wedding right is like terbaik ah pada I um shout to shah ibrahim he make it like macam it's like a hotel
tapi still macam tak hotel juga parking is the perfect place to park the car because apa ni kat mana eh
kan tanjong katong complex yes so that place was macam tanjong katong complex where dia punya
um what is called ya mm ya dia punya parking is open space it's there's lot of parking kalau tak ada parking pun you can still park at wisma you can still park at
hooga eh salah group punya side banyak tempat untuk you nak park secondly aircon
ya that time was like the aircon was best and then dia punya makanan and then when I ask my friend because um I think a lot of people already three of my friends already get married there semua cakap makan and everything is just cost like less eh
ya about thousand a thousand people also so it's like macam that is like one of the biggest regrets because that time it was my wedding I mean it was like macam if I was married on that time right then it'll be nice lah cuma one thing about bad about that place it's not bad lah I say macam
not that fantastic about that place is just that dia punya tempat nak tukar baju and everything mm
ah yes because the things that macam okay for
all malay wedding as what we know as apa kita tahu kan mesti nak kena berapa banyak kali
ya around two to three right uh some ours was three ya ours was three eh no the sanding was two and then the nikah was one but nikah was a day before
so macam kita kita macam wah get married and then ah one thing about ya that one is just that ah
and then dapat hotel semua my friend actually uh because of that it actually slow down the the wedding process lah like macam because wedding malay weddings like kelam-kabut nak mampus leh bukan bukan uh macam jauh ah ah macam
bila you dah you nak tukar baju kan lepas tu you nak kena pergi patah balik kat tempat sanding
sekali macam you nak kena naik kereta go to the hotel just to tukar baju and then go back there so macam ah traffic and then campur you nak kena make up semua and then nak kena pakai baju semua so eventually that one ah take process up to two to three hours eh
the hours eh maybe along the way do you figure at know criteria was amended to alah dah cukup datang
tak lah tak juga pasal kalau nak buat photoshoot tak ada time mesti orang nak ambil gambar lagi kan ha semua orang nak ambil gambar that time semua ha selit sikit
sikit ah sikit jer tapi that's the only macam if for orange ballroom ah but then if I would go I will still do at orange ballroom then who knows maybe our ten year anniversary kita buat wedding lagi
and another thing is inviting people that I don't like this is my mum punya dia akan suka okay about malay wedding eh
you will always invite those people who either you like or you don't like or terpaksa like
because these people are like somehow somewhat related to you I remember there's this one makcik when my mum actually invited her to our wedding she was like eh you got child ni you got child some more ah
walao I was like macam eh nak eh kelakar lah makcik ni
a lot of the the cousin after that right like after my first cousin usually dia orang cuma ingat yang my mum cuma ada my brother and sister my kakak lah
cause my brother my kakak is the only people who are like macam
terserlah I me and my adik kita orang macam relax ah kita orang relax chill lepak bro tak buat apa-apa semua kita relax tak macam
my sister and my brother ha kita memang low profile relax ah relax like like you juga kan you pun relax tak buat apa-apa juga macam
ya lah tapi that time uh
we did say to uh my sister did say back because my sister was there I wasn't there kalau I was there macam over
so confirm I dah gaduh dengan dia lah tapi dah tak uh tapi K what if K takpe next question uh just asking you what is the luckiest or like macam you rasa macam
um thank god that time one one thing is the cuaca kan cuaca cuaca was like perfect ah okay then another thing apa yang you suka pasal that wedding
the other guy I mean my friend punya
I feel like macam that is the most the best thing ah of my wedding the food was nice also sadly ya
it's not about tak boleh makan or can makan also it's all about like
picture perfect I don't know ah maybe maybe it's not something to regret now actually ah menyesal sekarang pun tak guna tapi
mm tak ha dah kahwin pun ha tapi um
talking about rewind also ya if can rewind this is all the things I want to do lah tapi macam
macam kalau tak then I I I I still okay so takpe okay so nevermind let's move to marriage life okay
lepas kita kahwin lepas kita kahwin I dapat tahu yang perangai macam mana I dapat tahu macam mana you punya cara you everything I learn throughout the five years
because okay but this is what my one of my makcik cakap auntie lisa lah she told me that
orang ketiga ke apa alhamdulillah I'm so happy I'm so thankful that there's no orang ketiga
it's almost six years already um we are not uh blessed with a child yet but no matter what I'm still blessed with uh being with you lah okay so um tapi kan I nak tanya you what was on your mind
okay uh bila you dah kahwin okay once you dah habis
all the nikah right and then um all the sanding semua dah habis kan and then outside then um kat dalam bilik dah makcik-makcik semua dah balik dah mandi dah siap semua nak tidur kan
but what was on your mind eh dalam otak you tu apa you fikir macam it was for me like I fikir macam eh aku dah kahwin lah seh
aku dah aku dah I'm like all these responsibilities macam fuh dah jatuh kat kat I lah then I rasa macam eh I dah kahwin eh like like really I dah kahwin eh I tak sangka I dah kahwin and then ah so I was like macam okay takpe lek even even like few days like after the wedding
when I want when I woke up right I can't believe there's someone there's a guy beside me I was like I actually about to shout there lepas tu macam oh wait wait wait kau dah kahwin
okay so that was like uh that but it wasn't a big thing yet ah ah but for you what what's on your mind bila
you bila all this dah habis kan and the sanding part semua dah habis what's on your mind from your like marriage kind of thing
ya then like because the thing is that uh okay regarding about the call right dia macam mana tau
because the thing is that kalau you call because where I'm living alone I don't have anything like to even as your mum also she be more worried like if like the father your father is he at home ke tak
ah not because um curang ke apa lah ha but it's more to like macam um like you pukul berapa nak balik I mean like worried tau worried uh you you also did because the thing is that
bila I dah jadi isteri
where are you tu semua and stuff like that then it's like also one another thing is that I'm alone at home anything that can happen like macam kalau malam alone not that good lah kan cause it's like macam
I can't say that the neighbourhood is actually quite good lah thank god we've got a good neighbourhood ah but no people like any tom dick or harry ke apa ke you call dia orang nak strike strike malam apa betul tak
ha so I tak suka lah kan
then um so another thing is like respect lah also then when you respect my decision of talking you I mean telling you ah bila eh you ni bila nak balik ni semua then you respond okay at least I know actually I just need a respond that's all
ya tapi there's the I mean mostly you like about that lah ah but one thing about him like you tak kasih I you kasih I bebas
kebebasan also so I rasa macam happy lah ha so ya that was why ya okay that was on your mind lah like responsibilities and stuff like that also right
okay so the next one is like what you enjoy on this marriage and everything what thing I enjoy right and I found out lah yang kita ni ada banyak kesamaan in terms of like movies
ya and then like macam movie macam
some movies of course they some movies that you don't like macam harry potter you don't like tapi um lord of the ring you like and then
err so macam okay lah give and take ah stuff like that uh then but then but the most thing that we enjoy
jap at that time you belum apa at least one time only but the thing is that when that day that time happened right
meticulous lah macam semua benda I mesti macam make sure that everything eh mesti macam
goes well lah uh because I punya orang tak macam itu tau I punya orang tak macam eh tak jadi pergi sini ah pasal ah due to this and that and this and that I rasa macam I rasa risau ha but I think that time
I I say to myself maybe there's a reason why I'm not supposed to go there but eventually on that day eh kita macam eh on that time we actually had fun eh ha better correct we we had even more because it was impromptu macam tak plan apa and lepas tu kita terus like uh okay just dive ah
kita pergi cameron and port dickson
duit ada so I macam okay I terjun jer ah ha so it was macam it was fun lah it was fun kita pergi honeymoon tu semua and then we get to know each other we eventually we get to know more about each other then uh travel then
uh then he he can drive well ha naik atas semua and then because that one also is my first time I went out to um holiday without my parents in my whole entire life
I have always travelled with my parents I never like travel alone ke pergi dengan kawan ke or pergi
dengan boyfriend apa tak pernah my my travel is usually just my parents so usually like
the hotel tickets semua kan orang lain dah siapkan dah
tapi kan ah but one thing is just like it's just fun lah tapi it's it's one thing like I feel like macam wah dah dah start into responsibility end up okay dah tahu macam mana nak book hotel tu semua lepas tu dah tak tak habis-habis stop tak asyik book hotel jer nak pergi holiday jer
actually ada banyak juga for bandung but ada tapi kita tak tak venture ke sana lah
I regret tak kumpul duit banyak-banyak lepas tu kahwin but then again I rasa this is still the right time because the thing is that
ah macam kita tak boleh buat macam uh and then um but then again after I dah berapa tahun yang I realised that
I shouldn't rely on people punya kind of marriage and my kind of marriage cause
I find that because I rasa kan the time I I
I macam suka ikut-ikut orang ah macam oh dia ni ada bag dior I pun nak bag ah yang I nak pun nak I I pun nak pergi makan kat sini makan kat cafe ni semua but then after awhile then I realise
I think it's not supposed to be our kind of wedding lah our wedding supposed to be like macam our kind of marriage is supposed to be something that is just us
like a lot of my friends success friends so one thing about them is that that dia orang suka um
cause of course I know I got lot of flaws also and hey you jangan cakap you pun tak ada flaws gitu eh ha tapi macam like
you you got any regrets of the marriage itself like for example kan macam kalau dulu you tahu kalau before kahwin kan uh kalau kalau tak kalau you kahwin you can play endless car ke apa kan freedom yes you are the freedom to do whatever you want to meet your friends also have can anything but um
after marriage maybe you find like macam oh nak kena layan dia ni lah nak nak kena pergi sini nak pergi sana I cannot do my stuff and stuff like that do you have any regrets ah
but do you have any regrets of marriage not wedding oh macam sekarang ha macam for me kan I tak regret
okay because I I'm okay with marriage but uh macam being
but I know that there's certain things that I cannot do when I'm married ah ah but one thing about you you don't you don't let macam ah give me to kongkong you know macam like
I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do that kan ha tapi you kasih I freedom of what to do like for example even this uh recording screen ke apa ke
some people will find it macam the guys don't let like like you know they don't let the wife do this and stuff like that some
find that if the the lady wanted to do business or what the guy don't give ha so macam it's a lot of things like like the guys don't really macam into it lah
ha cakap nanti berselerak lah apa lah
ya kemas tu tapi macam tak boleh macam marah lah kan so so eventually macam not all guys can actually accept this ah so actually one thing I I happy lah I dapat kahwin dengan you so I happy that this thing doesn't occur to me much
which I find it macam funny ah because that time I wasn't planning mah to get married so after get married this guy wasn't like really thinking eh this guy okay or not ha
I I tak boleh seh kalau you cheat I cannot like if you cheat like
ha if you do have another girl outside or what then um that was one of my biggest fear lah I have I don't have like small small fear but then macam that one I think that if that happen terus cut ah
ah and also pukul lah but then I there wasn't any hit or anything ah I'm I'm still as fluffy as possible but then I'm not a bruises or anything lah uh so um okay for you is there any biggest fear about this marriage
uh like for example anything ah that you think like ada ke apa biggest fear lah
some in-laws lah kalau there is I is not pretty and the in-laws don't accept which is to me macam I I that's one of my fear like when I get to know your mum ke apa and then your mum don't like me akan cakap eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni sia eh sorry sorry I didn't your mum won't say like that
anyway like eh asal kau kahwin dengan dia ni ha dah lah gemuk tak lawa tu semua but then it's like
not like that ah your your parents are not like that ya they are very welcoming and they are and we actually did slept before waiting out we did actually um uh apa ni tinggal kat rumah mak mertua so we were like
featuring guest lah kalau you nak uh
six years and then macam kalau you want to have another what what what is your no request lah what is your future plans for the next four years before we step into that ten year punya anniversary ya
ha to join us apa semua tu so I wish that kita our financial also is doing good and everything and then um healthier family and also um slimmer but until now also dah five years also still not slim so
ya lah takde lah just just saying only
like in that one stream because kirakan everyone dapat lepas geram ah that kind of thing so finally can get to give him money and people will send him like five hundred dollars at the time I was like damn these people got money I also want sia I haven't sent my first super chat but I want to send to someone I'm planning to do it when someone is doing then I can be like thank you for your service thank you very much
this girl also she she debuted like I think a month back her avatar is very cute she's like a shark girl she's super cute with the tail and all that she debuted like less than two months ago then she already hit like a million subscribers everyone was just throwing money at her it's insane dude and these people never even don't even need to show their face they just sit there act cute on camera play game tu jer easy game dapat duit
so everybody was like okay just wait until the next character banner comes up which I think will be zhong li that's why tu aku pun nak sia he's so hot I cannot I really cannot
uh oh then yesterday I was watching another one of his streams it was it was the funniest like games stream that I've ever watched because so there's this girl her name is chihiro yuki but basically she's her main character is like uh this magic girl and then but sometimes she she uses like a deeper voice kirakan macam jadi lelaki lah that kind of thing so uh then she was streaming Apex with that voice and then suddenly these two guys two of her friends join in then they like want to play along then dorang pun buat suara merepek gitu then they were like oh I want to do this then they were like shit they were saying it in the in the like manly voice and then suddenly they go back oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to do that it's damn funny but if they stream didn't last for that long long lah but
tapi I faham that situation that was me when I was playing when I started playing zelda I was like so kecoh you know I'm like aku macam budak bodoh sia aku aku nak nak simpan dia nya apa tu I wanted to like stop I would accidentally press the arrow button like to to aim the bow and arrow then after that bila aku nak aku nak cancel kan aku lupa nak cancel then instead I press the left side dia nya down button and then that's how you activate the whistle right then after that instead I start attracting all the monsters in the middle of the night macam budak bodoh sia I died so many times while playing that
lagipun you main you like now you play is it PUBG or is it COD
the theory of relativity for fun like this guy then I remembered the one thing I used to play a lot I had the Wii Fit then aku just duduk itu dengan apa tu dia nya itu like the the white punya platform itu then I look at the thing then I'm like eh aku berat ah sia then after that I was like okay whatever moving on but that was quite fun then but I did have the
uh I don't know ah I don't remember her name but I went to her house cause my mak nak pergi masjid so she had to drop me off there ah then she was then oh my cousin like she was playing Mortal Kombat on the then you know at the ripe at the really young age of four then like she was playing it and I saw it and I saw someone's spine get ripped out of their body and then um ya it kinda traumatised me I couldn't sleep that night cause I was always looking at the door I was scared that someone would come in and then rip my spine out ya so that's
oh serious ah dia orang belum like you beli kat mana Shopee
I think you try dahulu kalau dia orang tak reply baru send email
serious masih belum
it's kat Carousell or what
BTOB huh BTOB can they okay to be fair I guess half of the band half of the band is still in the army but the first thing I think I showed you right the first thing like changsub and eunkwang just got like uh they just got released right recently then the first thing they do is go act stupid or some national television show where some matching gold and silver outfit with the X on bodoh it's like if I don't know if you know but they did something similar like a long time ago
it's it's like those body tight suits then changsub pakai yang gold then eunkwang pakai yang silver or some or it was the other way around it was like skin tight you know it's the kind cuma muka dia orang jer boleh nampak and then they go on national television you know and then they go sing some stupid trot song then they come out of the army okay lah admittedly now is a bit more classy dia orang pakai macam like black they like the black business pants black business shirt that kind but doesn't take away from the fact that they are doing something so bodoh but okay lah I miss them I'm glad they're back those two are probably my favourite members
so now I'm but I'm so I'm glad that in wait in the army got to rest I'm glad that he he and key got to enlist together that one was damn funny the video with the band members dia orang tengah buat hal kat belakang tu kan tu merepek sia but at least at least it's good to see that they're having fun in this
tapi dia orang punya army macam best jer
like the concert I remember eunkwang was inside one like dia orang masuk army buat ke pe ke dia orang tengah buat some musical school or what sia I don't get it dia orang ada military band lah buat performance sini performance sana dia orang buat parade abeh tu kita kat singapura dia orang macam nak mati sia
I feel like april some should have gotten though I was talking to my secondary school friend the other day then then his was he had to enlist in april tapi dia dah dapat
I'm aku aku pun tak tahu sia I have one friend who cause dorang ada I cannot I don't
he got an offer to join like dia orangnya commando training or something like that it's like macam
I feel like elite is too is too strong of a word but macam lebih dia orangnya fitness level is a bit higher than the rest
seram sia then he then they said that oh they will learn
kirakan body of the army isn't it or is that weapons infantry
tak kan
ah I remember I remember the whole fiasco everybody was like oh my god what happens if they need to enlist like guys chill it's their it's the law they need this is bigger than you guys weh tapi seram seh the fact that they have to draw lots I feel like that's scarier I rather just everyone enlist like that
there has to be a better way to do it rather than drawing lots it really felt like oh dia orang dah tak boleh kesah korang nak macam mana nak buat macam ini ah tak pe lah aku tak kesah ah pick lots jer lah gitu jer
gitu jer really that's the gitu jer the effort
but it's seram sia
ah itu itu itu itu itu that was probably the most war like thing I've watched but
and it's budak kecil lagi
the part when dia apa itu dia kasi batu eh batu then dia ingat it's gula or something like that
my nenek was I remember she I cannot remember if she told me the story or my mum told me the story
dia orang tengah I think they were like searching the houses or something like that then
dia nya mak bapa they put her and her siblings
rice sack then letak kat dalam drain then two of them the siblings they put they hide the siblings inside the rice sack cause dia orang masih kecil kan then dia orang letak kat dalam drain dia orang cover then after that they ran away I don't know what happened after that I didn't really ask I kinda wanna know but I don't really want to ask cause
lagipun masih kecil sia it's
dia orang naik sampan serious
you'd be budak indonesia now wow
it's the one that resulted in yang dia orangnya nuclear meltdown kan is it
cacat isn't the right word because it looks very pretty but it seems like it's all deformed and like
correct correct it's like what you see in like sci-fi movies gitu seram siot I wonder if they rebuilt it
merepek sia this guy
but I do but I guess that's the one thing about japan ah dia orang they're very secular
new zealand aku pakai hijab kan then bila kita masuk okay lah granted this was quite a long time ago
kita me and my mum my dad cause me and my mum dua-dua pakai tudung kan kita masuk cafe dia orang tengok kita macam kat zoo sia dia orang macam
like bro chill I'm ten like don't okay I wasn't ten but like like like don't need to stare so hard you know but then when bila kita kita pergi japan all that they were much more polite about it even if they didn't like it they didn't say it outright
belongings anymore you can't retrieve like old photo books so it's kind of like everything your whole life just got washed away like that ya and at that time I think a lot people at the beach also so ya lah it was quite suay that it happened and I don't think it just affected aceh it affected some parts of malaysia also ya ya then kat situ pun ada macam satu family dia orang pun dia orang tengah main-main kat beach then dia nya anak pergi lari near the coastline ya then
seram pe
that's true ya the pros are pretty big considering that we have like protection from natural disasters singapore like singapore is a pretty safe country I would say like the fact that I can leave the house with the windows open and come back with everything still intact I think that's pretty impressive within itself like I saw the news dia orang kan like ada orang malaysia tinggal kat singapura since the borders dah tutup kan
limited is it like orang like pekerja so like I think either they went back or the police found out or the neighbours ke pe he found and he had the house they had the house had been broken into then apparently the thieves the
right it's so gross kan like can you imagine you come you cannot go back to your own country because of COVID and after that when you go back all your stuff dah hilang then ada orang tidur kat dalam katil kau ee seram sia I cannot it's gross it's so gross
for all the homeless people in like los angeles or that part of los angeles cause itself is besar gila kan there's only two doctors who are offering who will go around giving out free healthcare free check ups for these people like can you imagine the first the the fact that firstly there's so many homeless people is already like so telling of korangya government but then the fact that so many doctors like come on obviously there has to be a lot of doctors right in america the fact that only that cuma orang dua orang jer are willing to give out free treatment for these homeless people like they seriously what do you lose from it you know like where's your basic sense of humanity if you've got you've got the knowledge and skills korang just check up sikit pun boleh pe the fact that only two people regularly do it
it's so insane I cannot stand america dia orang nak vote pun buat hal
it's gross sia then now also I just really hope really really really I pray to god ya allah please forgive me for all my sins just just make sure donald trump tak menang serious I if people if
people are still dia orang nak tulis apa tu cause you can write in to you can even if your candidate name is not there right you can write in the name of someone which is a bit bodoh ah honestly like what's the point a lot of people dia orang tulis nama kanye west tau because he was he's been joking about it no it to us he feels like he's joking but to him it's like he's it's real right he's been talking about oh vote me in for president president guys then I'm like
asal kau nak buat macam ini ya allah serious why it's so bodoh I cannot and the fact that
it's like I was a bit scared because jangan vote opposition for the sake of voting opposition like you kena tengok pandai-pandai lah look at the zone if it's versus what
reform party or something the the group that nampak macam gangster mat mat on the street macam mat biker ke pe macam at like
if they can't even give a proper speech if they can't even sound motivated on national television you think they can take care of your zone and all like pandai-pandai ah don't vote anyhow for the reform party lah
like I get that it's good to have opposition but pandai-pandai ah don't
I have to admit though cause dahulu I tinggal kat serangoon kan I used to stay under worker's party area yang hougang serangoon aljunied itu I have to admit a lot of things were broken a lot of things weren't fixed properly that kind of thing but I guess you're right lah ya dia orangnya financial backing
but that's the part that I don't get kalau they're dia orang dah kat dalam government
abeh itu then they want to upgrade the resident's like area
ugh so sad I really cannot I'm I'm never gonna get over it aku serious nak pergi overseas
that's why sia the moment we were like waiting for the news is the border going to be closed or not but then bila kata tutup then we were like ah shit
it's only end of week one there's so much stuff to do already and I don't know what's going on I feel aku masih belum tengok election video takpe takpe whatever selama aku dapat mark attendance it's okay takde exam pun tak yah kesah
but did you know now that I think about it right at first I was like very sure that I wanted to do magazine but then now that we're actually during production production macam
hmm like not bad seems quite fun also but I guess we have to wait until we actually see what it's like bila the test ah I'm just scared
a maritime in logistics I think there they have actually two course so they have a maritime law and actually and maritime logistic so I'm think I'm having interest in the logistics so macam and I feel that lagi senang ah
ya but it's a more of a countryside punya tempat mm so okay lah there's no distractions I think
actually is a really a good job because like dekat that time intern tempat intern aku bourbon
kau tahu tak admin earn berapa
ya no because I think you see industry mana lah like I feel like kalau kau should search in
maritime punya admin cause they don't go they don't go on board
they just duduk office and just um
friend is admin dekat maritime that time dekat bourbon so she earn two point five but then after after the is ready is one point nine ya correct
under law punya admin
two points seven cause she got a lot of experience no no need you just admin macam registration orang nak masuk
those work that people don't want to do macam filing and stuff
pasal sia
I have still have time to march ah to think about it to I mean to go bank also to minta loan study loon and stuff
like a news so macam like my previous intern might cause I'm still keeping contact them one of the managers kena buang sia
retrenched macam because the economy was busted sia
but ya because aku like from a project I've been working with him so he's the one who actually ya guide me but now they retrench him macam wah
there's a will there's a way betul
also think if tak bising ah

president of the france kat paris itu like you know dia kata apa like recently dia kata like islam is the region is the problem

oh ya makcik seth ya so apparently seh couldn't do work properly ya and then and then got send out and then got send away that's why we wanted to came out why barang-barang semua tak betul kan
ah I mean if you really want you can but I think dia masih qualify lah
she's married what ya but she's she's married kan so kalau dia married but the husband is is B
so dia boleh declare berapa banyak dia nak apa you cannot
in which even if no matter what amount she puts because for us it's below five hundred kasi dia susah report to company
no but she going to class A so mama said will be like not so busy so most probably since dia ah
dia layan orang punya karenah ya
mama bear tak datang mama bear tak datang niari
tan sri ada tan sri mm

clement leave yes and then darlene tak ada
colin tak ada colin he's on leave also no no no not colin siapa tu no thomas
for the company he volunteered kena kena volunteered lah
no I was through home then okay lah cause my wife kerja malam today
seven thirty so kira since I'm not going to see her tonight you see so just make it one day and then we just spend the whole day together
did my bookings for my staycation pan pac because my friend dia celebrating
no because my friend did err is doing ah his daughter's birthday party kat situ like the same one I did for my son ya so like eh like he's some relative also like staying over lah they actually asked us to I think just they book dua bilik back to back because the the room can actually you know you book it together
the rooms actually always separate there's outside door yang you boleh tutup then you can remove the bilik macam besar so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no lah then ask us to stay over for dua malam mesti dia ada ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in ah I've been there before no no the pools were but dia limited so you need to book when you're there lah so basically ah I want to go to the pool do you have any like
so ada kitchenette ada apa no no I don't know that's my friend
endorse then present it on saturday tu saturday ya cause saturday we got video shoot with suhaimi yusof
err there's a lot of groups lah yeah sheik alauddin group he sea games ya I mean he's like the he was like he's like the same like fandi ahmad he was the first melayu who got the spot ah so called went on international platform
and stuff but when it comes to sheik questionable ah there are but not a lot there's not a lot ajak-ajak ayam but now my
then kadang-kadang like copy paste copy paste apasal ni tak copy paste to me it's oh ya ya you use Macbook that's why I think I did use Mac computer before last time when I was working for this one company
ya something like no dia punya urat hati dia putus
sedih kan
it's only like what time tu
dua belas eh tiga belas
his parents used to stay two ah levels up from my rumah lama in west coast
so in a way I think we we were like we were so called growing up playing together when younger after that we went our own ways then dah tak apparently we meet back in the same school so that's why I know the whole family so the brother passed away one year after
I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy tau orang yang macam they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
even my friends also okay lah last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then macam like jumpa gitu jer lah like you know
I think so it was baju merah maybe dia maybe dia datang bulan lah eh no it's not august

but at least orang dia kan sopan santun eh it's real you find like a malay guy like so well-mannered soft spoken like that
unless he swings the other way very unlikely he's married ya so like so and still very macam courteous sopan santun or maybe because coming here applying so macam baik kan selalu kat rumah ya kesian
the kata orang tu nak jadi jadi jer lah
because there was this one ah there's this one scene so dia cakap
that's why we are quick to change will be like okay lah takpe lah it's okay dah dah takdir

my expending maybe might over spending I stop I don't have so whatever allowances I have is err strictly untuk bayar bill mm dengan bayar apa-apa lah macam dia punya ngaji ke apa benda tu semua then err kereta aku tak bayar lagi that that time kereta is my responsibility so kereta semua dia dia yang bayar sekarang and then ah he take only lah that's that's why he he he drive to work also which is good lah because now raining season I I prefer him to drive then
masih ah motor tu takde don't need to pay already so it it it's has no financial burden lah ah it's just petrol only so no financial burden to me is fine you know we can keep it
actually tak ya at at first I I I I was thinking about ya lah financially we are still quite a burden but after that I was like I have to stop worrying ah you know
ah the break times that is like already given like when you are going to work you can just grab breakfast anywhere kau pergi kerja then after that if it's lunch break ah ya lah is lunch break ah nobody is working what semua orang nak keluar makan lunch then after that it's the end of the day of the work day kau balik
I think I eat like what dinner pukul lapan I didn't eat breakfast my breakfast is coffee
then after that aku lupa nak makan
eh jemput minum so my breakfast is just coffee so laki aku cakap you have to look after your health is not that I do not want to look after my health is really tak ada masa ya
dorangnya buku sekolah lah lah buku madrasah lah apa benda nak kena beli
dah sec four hairi ah secondary ah
that's the first choice ya second choice is bukit panjang actually dia punya
dia punya aggregate is ah
in between err normal academic and express he can go to express but if you want to go to an express class he have to go to the the sekolah yang
yang tak best sikit lah
like teck whye secondary which we don't kita tak nak that's the only school that is nearby us that we never choose
laki aku tak suka lah dia punya um
ah ya so the neighbourhood dia tak suka jadi dia cakap cannot other school boleh dapat normal academic pun takpe tapi tak boleh
any school lah any school that we choose tu boleh
pasal sekolah eh tak pasal kau punya kerja eh actually dia dah macam dah branch out dah
eh tapi aku tak faham ah kau punya kerja buat apa
jual besi dah dia punya sales really drop ah
kerja kau ni macam mak mertua aku ah
kau jual besi mak mertua aku ah mak mertua aku jual itu ah ya
right not enough experience lah tu
but your work wise memang dah
kau tak boleh function ah how to function
macam lyn ah sama
asam orh kunyit ah but tapi kunyit hidup ah jangan pakai kunyit powder
kunyit hidup aku baru buat aku aku aku blend ah ah I blend kunyit
and then I put in one one container then I blend ginger put in one container so anytime you want to drink like err ginger lemon ke apa kan mm then you just take lah
letak air panas letak lemon letak honey habis cerita
to me deep station err dia punya tu terlalu
ya because dia letak garlic juga apa right
the lemon grass no dia dia macam blend benda untuk masak kau faham ah tu yang pada aku macam tak tak best
aku ya I always mix with water then I just drink it as a shot
that one is for what buat bangun pagi jadi perut kempis
you see ah that is the old people thinking you know if you watch if you watch the err those yang health punya shows kan the health shows yang melayu punya tau
terus cakap eh this one is all
it doesn't matter minum air sejuk ke tidak it does not affect your system
so macam aku aku kan ada yang that package that time err urut kat tempat err tempat cina punya
urut ah then dia urut-urut aku dia cakap oh you shouldn't be drinking too much err cold water your inside ah sorry china kan china women so dia cakap your inside is very wet aku dah ketawa of course lah my inside very wet kan darah kalau dry I die already your inside is very wet
aku tak faham apa maksud dia very wet
but then dia nak cakap aku punya tu sejuk ke apa system aku sejuk ke aku pun tak tahu I think it ya lah I think is a problem ah because aku kadang-kadang macam minum air sejuk banyak sangat kan kaki aku sakit seh
well haus nyah
aku tengah menyusu haus tau
serious lah kalau dah artiste mesti lah better
ya you add in that one lah like those floral floral things you know like the chrysanthemum ke bunga rose ke the dried rose ah they say is good for complexion
ah can ah it's easy it's easy to get what anywhere just add in aje tak payah letak gula it's just to flavour your your air
semua masuk gasak ah
tu ah kan cakap mak-mak ni berbual ada jer daripada satu topic branch out
kalau betul dapat is fifty dollars fifty
okay lah buat
macam laki aku buat ah that time aku tak tahu eh so one of the years birthday aku dia kasi aku ni
ni lah ni apple apa ni apple pay ah
aku tak tahu pasal that time kita baru masing-masing masih kerja like still very new kind
experiment kena kasi darah
ah tapi dia kasi darah I think a lot ah then have to come like couple of times ah so
sumpah aku tak tahu nyah so he say because of that then they pay me to be the experiment punya person so the money I get I buy this one lah wah sweet lah sangat touched touched lah banyak-banyak
lama anak aku masih kecil lagi dua-dua aku masih belum ada hasif masih tak ada
eh dia takut jarum ah aku tu yang aku hairan
for all my pregnancies the man have to come to to take their blood or whatever right dia takut gila jarum kecil macam gitu pun dia takut huh the err they check blood right
mother and father punya blood or something ya ya ya hmm
even like at work if he has to do the um flu jabs right he always decline then I say why it's err it's compulsory he's like no it's it's not it's not compulsory so that's why I always reject uh huh anyway dia cakap anyway dia berbual dengan dia punya nurse um the nurse told me not all flu jabs are
what's that word no no no not murah it's free what they they already have to take it not all flu jabs are effective
because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string ah dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for I take don't need to take ah
siao because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho ah tak takut tapi lepas tu ah
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising ah
sekarang dia dah start jalan kan jadi rumah aku berselerak ah
ye lah
I don't mind berselerak sometimes but
diri kau sendiri lah
I know lah it's good but you see ah I'm I'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
I have all the phases that's the problem that's why I aku macam stressed because I have one boy I have one eh actually ah this conversation do we need to speak singlish or not
no need eh nevermind ah
asalkan ada dua-dua lah mixed
hairi dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay I have aira who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
hopefully soon belum seh she ask she ask me you know ibu when am I going to get my period five already primary six
dey kau sec one eh sec two ke sec one I know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes lah aku primary three
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start kan chocolate lah ah that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya I think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay jer lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period ah tapi after that I'll get it lah he's my marker first then after that I will get it nanti dia okay kelakar kan ya but but after that will be ah ye sejiwa lah sangat ya I think we sync already
ya so I have aira then I have hasif who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam elly masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute lah masih cute lah juga hasif tak tau dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because I'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh tau dia yang suruh
in a way lah tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether I'm okay or not aku I have to tell him the truth ah I'm not okay
there's once I actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja eh senang tau kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay I see you later ah then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours ah it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you ah but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner ah then you don't see ya me instructing them eh pergi mandi lah sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu oh my god
alah camera tu camera tu for show jer bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat tau aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle tau
except for sometimes berselerak which I will I will always like okay okay clean up clean up
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed ah kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
anything ah so like because I have cats right jadi I have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning I have to do is vacuum then after that I mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam lah satu dua jam jer kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
I have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but I can't because I have a I have a err a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if I shave them ah
tak lah cepat lah nanti grow balik ah ah
kena shave again aku shave sendiri lah mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
ah initially kita shave sembarang a'ah petak-petak lah gasak ah then after that macam initially macam kita nak eh let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head whatever lah then in the end ah tak kuasa lah go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam ah nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message ah macam banyak sangat itu ah messages coming to my phone
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way lah I the only way is for me to lazy parenting lah the robot I have I have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot tau kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot kan aku macam like alamak meja alamak ada child punya benda alamak mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused ah so the best the best thing ah when I was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy I do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde lah first hand semua second hand
I called it lazy parenting lah I just order them about macam ayra sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang a'ah lah
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no ah the island I push there already because I don't I don't bake any more mah ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak jer lah tolak ke tepi dulu so I have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
I think so ya because sometimes err aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat kranji juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
rumah jannah
aku nampak rumah orang jer view apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru kan the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
pasal that time aku tanya ah naz rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh ah aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus tau cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada dengan yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it lah since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya I was thinking of that ah
ya I was thinking you know like eh this is the best time you know yang let's just do it lah nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my what
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
hmm but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult lah cause if I prolong like this no job no contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
chey sudah lah
kejap jer then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
just be happy jer lah dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment ah because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
aira yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind hafis sleep with me
hmm because dia sorang jer apa yang she gets everything what her own her own like double girls lah ah but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far hmm that's why she don't mind that hafis sleep with her
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way lah so gasak korang lor
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
jap eh aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
ah takde pun
la ilaha illallah tak tahu lah
apa-apa ah
satu setengah ah mm mm
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much lah exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing kan aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap kan pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya I don't speak malay which is true lah he no oh my god tak aku jer mixed mixed aku sorang jer yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu chey berbual melayu yang yang no lah I mean like using proper malay words also I think I can try
a'ah tu lah aku pun rasa macam gitu eh cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku eh hasif ni kan in every of his class pasal hasif kan ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right ah in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual ah you hantar dia untuk itu eh untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool lah start daripada play group dia cakap eh how about your other children aku cakap oh ya my eldest tu memang ah daripada nursery ah all the way sampai kindergarten oh kita tengah cari families lah yang hantar anak-anak gi ah preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay jer aku aku sembarang gasak lah tak lah dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah lah aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu kan
to create awareness that how macam mana ah sekolah ah for preschool kan for preschoolers it's good to send kids err to preschool to
you know permulaan from all the different cases lah
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is err from
yang err
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu lah okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview I pasal the preschoolers ah cause is it because of this article that I read err budak-budak ah apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap ah ah tak dorang tak hantar then I say kenapa err what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar K one K two jer huh
aku cakap lah eh itu zaman mak bapa kita seh zaman mak bapa kita ye lah kita hantar K one K two jer ah tapi sekarang I think
the system dah berubah
if you send to the government punya the punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain lah kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam ah macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa seh pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you ah decided to hantar lah anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then I ask lah this interview going to be in malay or english eh abeh dia cakap in malay lah aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat mm kita mixed mixed boleh cakap ah boleh ah so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit ah like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly ah bagaimana ah bagaimana ah
mm ah apabila menghantar mereka tu kan ah did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan ah dalam pelajaran
ah development self development tu aku cakap lah pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah kan semua dah ada
err a program for them ah senang sikit
so dorang tanya like um
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel lah bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak lah improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very err friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut seh ah dia macam like ah gasak ah sembarang ah you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku lah like err is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi ah finances okay lah berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based ah government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa ah mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat ah tak ada tempat mm in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so I cakap okay terus terang ah untuk hafif I masuk kan nak masuk kan dia infant care
I registered him for infant care bila I masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap eh kiasu nya dulu pun I pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal eh orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that I dah kena I tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now I told her lah a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what I know I notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home ah
susah kan
take care only tapi ah
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard lah cukup lah
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like eh kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to
ah tak lah aku dengar apa ni
laki negro ni dia cakap
cam first dates semua tak mahu bawa apa ni macam makan semua just bawa jalan-jalan lepak tu macam wow betul lah pasal kalau
macam dia press for more nanti macam nampak lah what kind of person she is but ni semua orang dorang dorangnya alpha punya fikiran lah
aku keluar dengan kau ingat aku keluar dengan mimi kan tak pernah bayar apa-apa
tu ah cakap perempuan kalau gini dia boleh makan for free seven days straight boleh jumpa
but one thing aku agree dengan dia kan
macam baru kau kenal kan
she belongs to the street unless korang official about the status
macam kau tahu orang cakap macam kalau kau pergi date
kau fuck around pe gini macam suka hati dia ah
so like you have no right to like cakap dia slut ke apa kalau boleh meet sesiapa kau nak kasi dia banyak choice siapa dia nak as long there's no official status
dia berbual pasal ni kan
oh betul
ah ada yang kau pernah dengar this guy nama stephen top
tak stephen something ah some black guy dia tak believe in macam relationships yang macam boyfriend girlfriend
no matter what as long kau belum married kan you are considered just dating
I rather you still dating terus aku fikir balik
it somehow makes sense but maybe culture pun plays a part ah
asal ah
kau nampak ah
kau pun tak ada status pe
takde eh
yang laki selalu kau post eh
untuk aku ni semua macam pun ikut surroundings ah
cam not everytime kau kena guard
musim-musim you know you have to time yourself
kalau it's time to emotion let it out lah but if it's not the time then it's okay for you to be this way we understand
but at the time kau kau tak cakap then you still takde as long ah you know
cause of them takut cakap
laki takut nak keluarkan emotion kan but
some of them dorang okay keluar emotion but they don't know when
bila orang tak tahu macam mana nak express dorang punya emotions aku tak boleh pegang ah
ha ha ha asal asal dia cakap gitu
missus cheong sedih ah tak nak tengok
to think of it kan it's as seram at the same time
once dia dah realise ah
tapi untuk aku singapore is just that kita tak jumpa orang yang extreme ah like feminist
kau sendiri macam it's a wreck
dia is the true
epitome yang yang YouTube
video yang kau cakap most of this
just macam rosak ah like
that's why kau cakap they use this macam as their own is their moral compass ah
like tak tahu apa yang salah betul dorang pakai ni then they just follow from there
that time cousin aku kena
dia post about ada accident dekat sengkang kan
he happened to help orang yang apa this anak dengan bapa dia ah accident motor abeh dia cakap pasal err dorang accident motor pasal dorang apa ada a wild dog
terus end up this
perempuan datang like into the conversation and say that eh like cakap like
there's this humans is the problem for entering dorang punya wild life and dorang cakap if this is what if you're talking about like putting them putting them down
terus cousin aku macam flip ah cakap you don't put words inside my mouth
macam don't stir something up that it is not there
what the fuck sia attention rabak sia
I mean like dia nya cousin aku nya intention is just to show that okay this area is quite dangerous imagine kalau kau lalu kan just beware of the dogs ah the macam apa wild animals
ni semua orang just find it a like opening of for them to just preach
tak tahu ah malaysia ah
yang malaysian
yang belikan anak dia semua eh
anak dia yang gemuk tu kan
what if the this whole thing is turn table laki yang buat gitu then laki cakap kak sedar lah diri muka kau tu dah buruk gini gini then you know it's just turn out to be ugly
ya we are untuk aku kan at the end of the day we are just living in two separate rules
dia tak macam sense of emergency ah
cannot focus macam takleh
ah dia kacau ah
dorang just macam
camne nak cakap eh pasal the reason why tiga orang to operate that one man machine kan is cause that two person tak tahu apa
ah macam terus ni apesal
rabak sia tu
like kepala ah orang
umur berapa sia
kalau aku aku tak kesah sia like I think taufik pernah cakap ah the macam untuk aku the apa not it's too accessible apa knowledge eh
dorang pakai sembarang jer
oh macam dia annoyed
kau kau pause eh
tak kan
takpe ah aku bawa gi toilet jer boleh berbual-bual sikit
ah tak ah sangkut kat luar
a'ah cuci tangan
semalam shuk shuk bawa apa ah makan
wah best pe macam yang taiwan taiwan nya eh
wah aku dah macam
huh bastard asal
oh tak halal
huh kau makan
oh kau taruk tepi untuk simpan
sial ah kau
asal ah
dia apa fight as if like politically or
untuk aku is a marketing strategy ah
kalau dia macam berbual macam admit dia president siapa nak vote dia seh
macam dia have to say
tapi kau tahu yang dia popular face habis cakap grab them by the pussy kan
ah itu bukan dia cakap during press ke atau during ni kan it's during macam dia punya free time want to record dengar kan
pasal tak salah aku aku tengok video clip is like somewhere macam kau tahu yang camera macam sembunyi-sembunyi abeh dia ada wall abeh ada
macam mesti lah orang orang kat luar laki lain pun cakap macam gitu apa it's just that ni pasal dia korang macam nak use that against pasal ramai orang kalau kau tengok they use that phrase against dia apa this is how he treats women gini macam sial ah
pasal orangnya perception eh perspective sekarang is like
camne eh they rather have someone yang in the closet
macam sial rather than orang outspoken
dorang takleh accept orang outspoken macam orang he only talking his own opinion in what appears on his mind what tapi orang tak boleh accept
pasal kalau untuk aku orang tu clean kan terlalu baik aku aku always despise
macam there's there's always a way macam macam mana kita berbual pun kan ]even though
you want the best for each other kan but definitely kita macam gini boys talk atau mesti ada berbual kotor pe like gini gini but
orang yang macam terlalu clean kan aku always very despise macam
bukan aku jealous tau like how are you really sure kau macam gini punya bersih like
cam they feel their feelings express it that's all
lagi twenty seven minutes
all the lie tak ah
asal eh
tak tahu apa dia nak ah
so at the end of the day pun different orang tengok lain pe
so macam upon macam texts pun sama
macam kalau aku cakap sial lah kau
tapi kalau kau baca eh dia ni maki aku pe sial
tapi kalau aku aku cakap in a very playful way
kalau kau tengok macam kau punya thoughts macam gitu then kau fikir cara gitu then
how can can you blame me sia aku say in a very cannot blame me ah
non-stop sia tu
ah dorang ada record macam some dorangnya
talk ah sedih sia
pasal kau boleh dengar dari suara dia sia kau yang ah
aku tak tumbuk kau sia I mean like kau tumbuk aku
kau tak cakap abeh amber macam aku pukul kau jer pe
pots and pans kau campak vase
like tak salah ke tu salah seh kau tahu
macam aku ada listen to few tips orang kahwin ah orang dah kahwin cakap
then that's why it makes sense bila dia cakap
kan selalu cakap stephen kan
buat apa kau nak relationship lama-lama
in the end asal kau nak a meet up marriage before you get married you know you are creating another problem for yourself
kadang-kadang fikir balik macam sedih sia kalau yet to find out
macam apa ni the person that kau sukakan and then bila korang kahwin is just a different person
abeh korang stuck tau you are stuck there don't know like kalau aku tinggal
ni thing aku salah bila aku let it be it's gonna be a problem for me so how do I even solve this sia
like I really dia just stuck sia
that's why aku always believe this phrase macam doesn't mean we can vibe we are compatible
like tak semestinya kita boleh vibe macam eh but we are compatible for each other it doesn't mean that vibe and compatibility is two different thing
like aku boleh kita like boleh macam
ah people always said like wah if I can vibe with you okay okay but sial lah that is just a touch atau it's a two different things seh
whether you're not kau boleh tinggal serumah dengan dia and like accept who she is that's a different thing sia
so untuk aku macam orang selalu macam cakap aku boleh vibe dengan kau it's a
it's not macam it's not cause you can't true
dia nya expectations or
that's why aku takut aku tak understand about aku nya self especially
like sometimes aku suka orang ni then aku akan go for her
but kan bila dah at the stage macam boleh aku just cabut diri
untuk aku is like tak one thing is commitment ah macam the commitment of having someone to jaga is untuk aku really takut untuk aku
ya aku nya reason why aku aku understand this part of me eh aku cakap reason why aku takde mata air bukan aku cakap aku takleh dapat aku boleh but it's just that
dah a few times aku try and then aku just cabut
like aku just fuck up like I always find the reason to fuck this up ah like
just ghost her atau
ya so like sometimes aku just macam bingit ah macam takde then you know like I want something but bila dah ada nanti aku just cabut
so I always remind myself macam
kalau aku suka orang aku cakap kalau dia betul-betul then go for it ah if not then for what you waste your time
like in the end of the day kau akan cabut juga pe at the end of the day kalau kau tak suka dia
that's why that time kawan kau tanya aku aku terus teringat sia ni
kawan kau yang yang kerja nurse eh part-time
tak ah dia tanya takde mata air macam tak ah macam asal entah eh terus aku terus cam teringat ah ni like
aku kalau ada ada ah tapi it's just that at the end of the day aku cabut
aku ya
ya pasal
untuk aku pun itu is a different way of err camne nak cakap eh
it's a different way of macam kita own body ada own mechanics ah
the reason why macam aku dengan kau is always macam
diam dulu then nanti baru gerek is cause technically we are trying to protect ourselves
like dia ni boleh ngam ke tak tak leh ngam then why not why for what aku waste akunya time
kalau dia punya dia punya mindset is macam I got nothing to lose the world is mine
then like just live life to the fullest lah that kind of mindset ah but for us yes we have that mindset but it's just that macam
macam apa ni you don't need it unless we really need it come ya
romanticism atau all the stuff
ya lah I understand
one thing dorang been berbual pasal gender role ni semua kan dorang sendiri confused with their own gender role this kind of thing untuk aku lelaki shouldn't be the one doing it the most of the time it's it's a feminist trait lah I would say
so macam all these macam sweet stuff
all the macam masculine stuff the girl of course have to be kalau dua-dua side macam family then how how do we even counter this
there's no balance ah then after that's when nanti dorang dah complain oh dia ni annoying ah gini gini gini
like you eat too much sweets sakit tekak pe
kalau kau suka laki tu apa-apa dia buat pun sweet pe
dia tak buat apa-apa pun sweet abeh kalau laki tu macam he's not your type
asal pula aku kena panggil creep
ya lah
that's untuk aku there's no such thing ah
cause the scariest part kan macam macam mana kau dah kahwin dengan this someone kan
how sure are you that this twenty four hour otak dia is bedek bedek
bila kita tengah main kan aku boleh imagine someone else asal kau tak boleh imagine someone else confirm kau boleh imagine someone else pe but at the end of the day you have to give and take let her be and let her think let us think
that that's why the misconcept of macam
like oh takde connect then they cakap to make it in a very layman dengan very
to see that they are smart atau they can feel all these oh takde connection ah
ah lagi
thirty seconds nak tidur nak tidur
oh okay okay okay aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni mystery shopper that was many years back lah then after that uh the I only did once
because uh lepas tu like there's no job and nobody call me lah I did the ah aku pernah buat yang apa yang shopping tu eh
I did the one for uh one of the retailers in singapore lah but I have to go it's a it's a one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet tau lepas tu kan
one of the important one is the customer service ah because they are rating customer service punya survey
so you actually depends ah macam when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things err they are looking out for
and then err ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak outlet lah
tapi uh after that they never call me oh for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar tapi dia punya product is
then uh she's given one product so it actually varies macam kau buat uh mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like err basic necessity macam for your home
but uh my friend one is quite interesting dia pergi dia buat pasal uh food product ah I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think macam like uh macam maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
lepas tu nanti uh dia kena pergi uh two or three no three or four different err supermarket
so it depends ah macam mana kau punya what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
tak lah sia upfront
so it's your own free time bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
ya it's quite fast cuma uh they will give you a deadline lah by this date kau kena submit back come back to the office and submit ah
lama seh but I think that time was not hundred ah less than that
mm assignment tapi the assignment uh dia kasih macam uh tiga
the one the ya then the questions is all similar lah cuma three different outlet kau kena pergi then macam outlet A outlet B outlet C lepas tu the questions are the same ah
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that macam berselerak ke ataupun very neat always very neat
uh eh this date this or this week right got this date this time uh apa ni surveyor coming
so it's like uh consistency lah cuma the
tapi like the working hours how
cuma it's like quite far lah I mean uh I think I feel like it's quite far tapi three times a week okay what ah
ya lah but I heard that the pay is quite good you know uh apa ni I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like macam dormitories eh the they can even pay up to macam I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend uh and my friend was saying lah macam gini like uh she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
tapi uh do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
ya lah rumah dia berapa bilik seh
mm it's so far it's still okay lah we don't have any pay cut tapi macam
macam uh like how long can we tahan like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical lah
so like uh and then plus being in the fintech kan macam don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
then uh like other products macam very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
ya lah I mean rumours have been going around lah it's better to look for something else but again in this situation macam mana nak cari seh
abeh kalau macam right now like right now I'm still okay lah I still have a job what but then
so I was like eh when I look at linkedin I was like eh ada eh orang masih nak masih nak cari ni ah
dia jaga macam uh one of the creative uh asia pacific punya director eh APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas pergi overseas punya office kan
lepas tu uh her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
basically aku tengok macam
I was like oh my gosh macam some people are just so lucky
lepas tu macam new joiner new secretary join kan lepas tu dia tak nak uh macam she she will be the mentor lah because she senior what
and then uh selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak jer lah like like just ask people to do ah ask people to do the powerpoint
uh ask people to change the apa send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay sekali it in the end bila dia punya boss tu dah tua ah
sekali just before I left uh boss dia kena macam apa macam apa tu
bukan retrench apa tu macam uh dah dah tua kan jadi uh kena
so uh they we speculated ah dia dia kata golden handshake so the boss leave right
kan aku dah macam eh kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak
for her europe trip lah this trip lah that trip lah I was like lepas tu the worst part is kerja lepak gila
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people yang macam very uh pandai buat powerpoint kan
ah then buat lepas tu dia dia just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
gila kan
no lah but she was she was okay lah it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise macam suka ask people to do buat ni buat tu eh
then she will be like uh sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap okay dia tolong kan
sekali apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know macam bastard kan then then I will be like oh my god gosh like
eh when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you seh then I was like okay lah then just telan jer lah because we are all junior level what she's the senior one what
macam merepek kan like so funny
and then she never tell him ke
yes yang dulu tu uh every time want to travel on only
kecoh seh but actually because I want to collect the points ah
so funny but they are allowed to travel on lah but then macam ah cannot the expensive uh like whatever flight eh kau tahu dari like expensive flights and all that right
ya lah macam yang boleh cancel boleh change semua kan
ya lah tu pasal kadang-kadang ah like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change lah or confirm will change his flight one right
aku nak book macam ah so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute eh kadang-kadang macam cannot so last minute what
ah macam ah the first name and last name terbalik apa and then got one or like I think two alphabet lah typo error
salah salah salah the name uh of the passenger becomes my name
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that uh apa macam
lagi pergi hong kong siak tu kalau pergi indonesia ke pergi mana mana like okay lah got potential to keep uh at most I pay back the company what
sekali tu that one is like like uh to hong kong and then is like completely different name ah so I called them up and asked to change right
and then uh apa ni they say cannot then I said
is I explained the whole situation lah I said I when I fill up I already fill up the correct name the correct passport the date of birth passport number semua
then cuma the last part the contact person the contact person when I fill up my uh I fill up my name
then uh there's one part that they they auto macam auto fill eh
sekali I go and pay everything then I realise and then after ah but they don't they didn't they didn't bother to listen to my explanation lah
tak baik seh
aku bilang aku punya tu lah yang senior tu makcik tu makcik makcik kaypoh tu
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku uh it's okay lah everybody make mistake don't worry tapi dia baik cuma macam dia kaypoh eh
lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku just tell the uh pula tu aku kena bilang
dia cakap just tell the he's a very nice person uh I will back you up anyway you just started
cakap okay lah selamat ah first time kan so aku cakap abeh tapi aku offer lah if you want I can pay half of the flight ticket ah muka sedih ah
tapi tu baik gila sia dia cakap uh nevermind it's okay uh just make sure next time you don't repeat the same mistake ni semua ah blah blah blah that one I was less than three months old in the company you know like I see how much was the ticket
ya lah tapi macam irritating tak boleh kasih chance seh
irritating lepas tu kan lagi sekali uh is what ah
then after dah kecoh gila sekali got one guy and one guy right he's supposed to travel he is from vietnam to singapore he supposed to travel uh with
lepas tu the three of them reached the airport
sekali two of them went in<malay>dah masuk sekali tu yang the this the the last guy right was they she want to check in ah then the dengan bag dia semua tau
kesian dia dah lah check out daripada hotel lepas tu dia pergi kat airport abeh airport cakap ah sir your flight is tomorrow not tonight

I was like oh shit I was like mula-mula aku ketawa tau aku cakap huh aku macam ketawa ah
sekali dia kata no it's not funny when you are at the airport and two of your colleagues are going to board the plane and you are stuck here with no hotel room to go to
aku dah macam eh sia ah die die sia mana aku nak carikan dia ni hotel and he is very specific luckily bukan boss ah dia macam manager level there

I don't want to fly macam certain timing apa dia sekarang aku nak kena book under the new flight apa dia mati-mati nak leave uh that night ataupun the next day morning eh
because he got meeting or whatsoever lah so he need to leave like there as soon as possible kecoh sia
ya then I was like ah okay okay let's divide and conquer you find hotel I go and find flight then he was like okay okay okay aku
tu lah masalahnya because they always keep on changing tau and then aku rasa uh yang yang lain tu aku dah book siang-siang tapi si lelaki ni
dia kasih dia bilang aku last minute dia nak flight ni nak flight tu the these are the flights he want this is ni ah
kira dia bilang aku last minute aku book kan dia separately last minute ah aku bukan book kan dia orang tiga-tiga at the same time
lepas tu aku tengok eh aku dah kecoh sia cari hotel
lepas tu aku cari flight ah lepas tu lepas tu dia call aku dia cakap did you manage to get the flight aku cakap uh not yet
abeh aku kasih dia options kan lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku ya I also can't get a hotel
uh it's too last minute and no hotels around here ah ya it's all fully book aku dah macam alamak
in the end we got lah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia like uh aku tak boleh dapat flight yang kau betul-betul nak at this exact timing yang kau nak depart this is the only best option eh
habis tu dia cakap uh apa apa apa lepas tu dia kata ah okay then uh he he we sorted out the flights ah
hotel pula then uh last minute he say he just went back to the hotel that he just check out kesian kau I feel so bad I was like
apa dia dia kata uh I just took I'm going to take a taxi now to go back to the hotel and see they have one last room
abeh aku cakap ah okay okay okay uh you take the cab and then I know lah the journey about thirty minutes eh
lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia you go and take the cab now I will call the hotel
lepas tu pergi ah
lepas tu dah dah finish after the whole episode right dia dah balik hotel dia dah dapat tau the last room and I think it's the smallest room he's and he's very particular about hotel room also
so dia cari dah lah last minute tak ada hotel tapi nak cari hotel yang according to his category
aku dah macam ambil jer lah hotel apa yang ada it's just for one more night the next day afternoon that time he's flying off already what
lepas tu dia cakap uh yang dia patah balik hotel tu sekali kita berbual-berbual uh abeh aku cakap dengan hotel tu ah boleh ah macam any room can ah because
it's just for one night ah lagipun dia selalu regular kat hotel kau
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay and then in the end they found one small studio room for him ah lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
dia kata no it's okay lepas tu uh sabo sia lepas tu dia dapat dia tak dapat flight yang pagi kan pasal the next day petang dia ada meeting tau
lepas tu pagi dia tak dapat flight yang dia nak kena balik kan aku dapatkan dia petang ke malam I think
lepas tu uh bila dia dia bilang dengan boss aku kira he's under my boss what dia bilang dengan boss aku uh
lepas tu aku cakap eh sabo sia dia ni tapi boss aku tak marah boss aku ketawa jer dia cakap are you just trying to skive and not come for the meeting
dia cakap no she book me the wrong flight aku dah macam oh crazy
kan lepas tu aku cakap dengan dia lah eh then you also should check you know aku tapi aku macam okay lah let's not be let's not fight over this aku cakap dengan dia we are both at fault I booked wrongly and you didn't check
mampus kan actually initially he was like that tapi aku cakap dengan dia there's really no other flights
uh budget flight pun tak ada unless you want to reel up and go via mana entah aku cakap dengan dia macam a very long route eh in the end you reach singapore also like the same
and lepas tu macam but after that he was like okay lah tapi he took that opportunity to shoot me back ah in front of my boss dia cakap ah ya she book me on the wrong date
flight back aku dah macam tapi yang ni pun sepatutnya aku kena declare dengan finance the ya the right
aku cakap eh uh eh this is what happen dia kata in case if uh anybody question then you can just look for me ah but if nobody question just let it go
buy new ticket ah lepas tu pun dah cock-up lagi then the the makcik kaypoh the senior told me like it's okay you just have to declare again aku cakap
declare lagi hari tu dah declare cakap sorry then declare lagi mampus
tu ah
lepas tu aku cakap ah takpe lepas tu but then the finance I think the finance explained to the lah
lepas tu dia cakap ah okay lah dah
uh aku rasa something more expensive tu pasal in the end he earn what right because he get to fly on the more expensive flight and don't have to go for meeting
uh entah
one way ticket totally different airline kiranya vietnam tu forfeit ah pasal dia tak nak travel on that timing yang kat vietnam yang aku dah book tu the next day punya kan
aku cakap pergi jer lah balik jer lah besoknya dah terang-terang dah ada vietnam flight tu
vietnam apa ho chi minh
tak tapi hari tu semua dah fully booked tak ada tak ada flight
budget airline yang kita check lepas tu ada like go uh transit via whatever very far away right
irritating kan with the transit punya tu
ya lah that's why I was like like lepas tu dia pula macam he's very particular hotel leh
then flight okay dia macam apa-apa macam economy apa-apa lah dia cuma but tapi hotel must be really
tu aku cakap mampus sia that day terus sekarang aku cakap uh we let's we both learned a lesson every time I send you you check okay
dia kata but uh it's not funny aku kata it's not funny when your
kan kelakar kan tapi lepas tu bila dia balik singapore I think the next he say hey let me uh hidayah let me buy you coffee we should go for a good coffee
dia cakap ya let's just go to the one across the road no need to get so expensive
lepas tu dia macam aku cakap dengan dia so next time moving forward aku book kau please check because aku cakap dengan dia at that point of time kau tahu tak date yang aku book tu bila
aku book on friday I think five plus in the evening eh nak dekat pukul enam tau
last minute everybody like confirm confirm confirm nak ni nak tu lepas tu kita aku duduk kat office tu dengan kawan aku kat depan ni
we went through like so many booking and then takut macam duplicate booking kan macam aku dah book the book kan
lepas tu some of the people right in the kira total about eleven twelve people all travelling at one time
but all like different departure date ah different timing different flight terus aku split dengan kawan aku ni aku cakap okay kau buat dia ni punya flight aku buat dia punya flight okay
lepas tu macam overlap lepas tu uh bilik pula kau buat ah okay kau buat this hotel room aku buat ni ni ni punya okay
lepas tu macam it's so messy I was like oh my gosh
takkan aku nak buat on weekend seh so I have to do it over what I was like

lepas tu uh those who is travelling on saturday there is some from my list that is also travelling on saturday so aku pass kat dia
lepas tu dia anyway ya lah
lepas tu ah it's it's like that lah so it becomes like I don't just take care of my team you know macam my team got ten people right she got two for example right
then I got like maybe three people that's also travelling on the same date as her one of the people that she's in her team so macam kita passing passing eh
lepas tu hotel pula lagi satu kan kita kena book direct we don't have travel agent what
ah aku punya team luckily that guy is like like like like very good I mean he's okay with me lah
he's irritatingly macam uh macam action he's from india
tapi actually he's he's a very straightforward person and he he mean no harm lah it's just business nothing personal eh
lepas tu yang si hotel lagi satu hal
kita book direct kita takde ni kan travel agent kita book direct kan lepas tu kita pergi lah booking dot com hotels dot com apa apa yang murah-murah tu kan
lepas tu hotel the the same hotel dah full

lepas tu kawan aku tengah pegang camera tengah jalan around the office kan sekali yang si boss yang aquarius ni
kau tahu dia bukan wave tau dia tunjuk middle finger lah sia
terus kita semua macam terperanjat because he really look like a nerdy good boy macam
you ask him to do anything dia akan buat punya ah macam very like listen like very obedient small boy like that ah
sekali kawan aku tengah jalan take the camera shot in the office kan sekali pergi kat tempat dia he's supposed to wave

sekali when he show the middle finger I was like oh my gosh all men are the same
ah dia kira aku punya boss ah dia dia
uh marketing side chief marketing officer kelakar
but I was like muka baik macam budak-budak baik sekali padahal sama juga
tak lah singapore ah
bro you can't even masuk malaysia
buka the border
but when did it even tutup the borders is it recent no eh
but I also scared to masuk malaysia now though like now malaysia tiba-tiba banyak gila case
ya bro like in a day dorang ada macam three hundred cases tau
but it's like macam at area but still like like it's COVID man it's like the virus dia boleh spread cepat-cepat pe no matter where you are
I know like a a week ago or two weeks ago it was like oh uh one case dekat like uh what macam punya yang macam apa sunway lagoon I don't know then tiba-tiba two case seh tiba-tiba like twenty lah blah blah then tiba-tiba in a day like one hundred or two hundred I don't know something like that
basically like spike up like the cases spike up in a day banyak gila
for real so I'm kinda okay that kita tak boleh masuk but the thing is for the past few months it was close like macam asal kita tak boleh masuk tapi ni dia dah spike up balik so I don't know
dorang dah start balik apa dorang punya I don't know like dorang dah start they have to start like staying at home again
I mean I was I was stalking like malaysian punya celebrity then dorang macam yay lagi then I'm like oh really for real that was like four days ago two days ago ada orang post gambar I don't know
I know crazy right bro I literally just only thought like it was a getting better then like tiba-tiba spike up balik
first like okay like alhamdulilah ah like I finger crossed it won't happen to singapore like even though yang korea dapat apa the second wave tapi it's not as much as malaysia tau
ya but it like the cases are not like super macam uh as macam extra like macam banyak gila
ya mana ada time nak
nak stalk syafiq kyle
even though I tak suka pun I akan tengok seh super bored
no I just know that eh I only watch if I know the pelakon or if I like dia berlakon
did you even know there's like dramas like halted dia punya then I was ah before this I also like quarantine different time kat saudi kan so I was also keeping up to this malay drama dia I think episode thirteen pasal because of COVID dorang tak boleh film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
oh my god but aku pun before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama lah K drama malas gila so damn long
no but it's so annoying is like ah no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together macam
iya lah ya lah I know but like I just I cannot no but that one I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that one I like and then the other one uh was when this dude ada breast cancer or something uh ya breast cancer ah
ya cerita lama
um apa like what cerita
that's why I cakap I tak suka tengok K drama cause it's so draggy
six times I swear every time she macam ah I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because kita tak boleh keluar right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime ke or a cartoon macam disney you know those kind of thing oh my god like macam fictional punya movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like macam one hour so attached to freaking marvel punya ah like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever ah bila apa uh uh ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like dia punya macam fake anak macam you know work to spiderman lah other than that like than I was like wah
that makes me macam happy already
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like macam marvel like after ni before I masuk uh I watch end game aku tengok like the whole movie sequence before that
then aku baca just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like macam warmth and comfort knowing that macam whatever at least spiderman ada girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like macam they did like alternate these stories of like that story
I mean the purpose tak semestinya untuk for that but macam mostly people macam when you like something so much like you crave for more what macam if you kau pernah tengok spiderman kan
you know how spiderman uh uh spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right macam peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland sekarang ni is like peter parker and but tak banyak movie of peter parker and what so people make fan fiction of it then kita macam oh my god imagine ah so happy
ya it's okay tapi aku baca fan fiction just like just to make myself happy lah you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
like what korean dramas kau tengok
how about is it that intrigued macam like
tak pernah like tak classy
like everytime hor I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare what like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so macam
no but general in general like if you want to buat like if you want to macam buat the drama tau like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel kau pernah tengok hotel del luna right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot pasal religion that's why
ya cameo then he datang right
oh my god I remember aku tak think of that sia
at the end okay lah it's okay but kalau K dramas usually kalau cameo dia datang just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode jer
and also I've never heard of like macam korean drama buat second season
for real abeh maybe sebab dia macam hospital hospital
of course [lah]
now like it's way even at like this malay station ah some tiga atau sembilan they they showing hotel del luna now you know
oh my god oh my god park seo joon dekat suria
bukan eh I don't know
like dub macam orang lain cakap take over orang melayu is talking like they speaking in melayu
no but dulu-dulu when my nenek watch cerita like macam apa uh you know the channel one
so it's a korean singapore punya channel but dia cuma apa tunjuk like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
tak suka seh it's so it's so
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub one even anime macam english hmm weird
but ya eww weird nya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any uh subtitle uh the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard macam buat jer lah like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person daripada this uh are actor ke apa entah dia macam oh ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like kau tahu parasite menang uh a few awards kan dekat america
so like uh I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people yang selalu macam dorang tak happy tau sebab a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people pun macam but why though pastu dorang macam cakap lah like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I tengok even I I tengok malay drama I pakai english subtitle tau
like even though I understand what droang cakap I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
aku tak aku tak kan masuk tau aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like tengok I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
tak ada ah sebab kadang-kadang okay because ada korean drama for me ah ada korean drama kan I don't know about you ah but from what I see right korean drama kan dorang ada banyak kalau you use the subtitle ah translation kan dorang banyak guna bombastic word tau
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process tau apa yang dia tengah cakap ni tau
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like macam read it slowly ya so that's why macam kadang-kadang termiss apa dia cakap ya so I was like thinking are they actually memang
ya bombastic words atau dorang actually because of the translation then dorang guna big words
but I was like thinking macam if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
huh really macam apa seh
singapore punya oh my god malay drama tak boleh sia
paling tak aku tengok anak anak metropolitan that was long ago but I never even keep up I just
I didn't really understand the story I just know that they are like really like macam kids who like have problems that's all
anak metropolitan singapore
after that after that macam dia punya tu what
ya I don't understand seh how to use semua tak tahu
then tak boleh
huh you didn't even masuk like this year or like last year
ya I went like masuk oh my god last year I masuk banyak kali seh pakai pakai train
it was so fast no at first I was so sketchy tau aku macam oh my god mesti like lama mesti like boring and like tired tiring it wasn't even that long cepat gila five minutes jer
for real really the immigration was so fast but I don't know but I went during like macam the june holiday
five minutes I'm not kidding five minutes for my mum I I went many times right so the first time I macam I didn't count but apa but the orang cakap macam five minutes so the next time I came my aunt really taruk timer it was like four minutes and like uh fifty seconds four three ya she really put timer you know
tak tahu it was last year
but kalau woodlands shouldn't like it be like the water wasn't around the water area I don't know but I in the train but you know there's a train from singapore to right
ya it's so fast gila like that time aku pergi um dia ingat puasa lagi pergi situ pastu uh tidur kat sana tau okay pastu the next time I pergi I pergi pastu burger dekat uh pastu balik rumah balik like I didn't sleep at I only went back home because it was that fast
it doesn't even feel like five minutes it's like I was just sitting there nanti macam dah okay
cepat gila kan
even when I took the plane uh they say when I balik right from to singapore it wasn't even thirty minutes you know
but usually how long is it from from singapore to because aku tak pernah you I how many times have you been to I feel like I'm the only person yang tak pernah pergi
but it's not like macam okay ah this this this december holidays let's go like you and whenever you go to kau pergi sebab ada family business but then you macam okay we can also chill at the same time is that what you mean
seremban kat mana
I never been there dude the only time I go malaysia is eh I only go to pun macam satu dua kali
from there from um you from but you went there you drove or you naik train
huh what apa kau I don't get it you say thailand now you say england
the atas atas sekali
oh my god that's why I heard this person from singapore dengan kawan dia like naik the motor pergi mana entah like wait
the driver okay will like damn I mean it's easy if you naik motor ah but then it's so cool to do that oh my god
I mean but but it doesn't I think people usually who go backpacking they they are going it for like the view mostly that's why they don't mind macam hotel like cheap ke apa ke at least as long as they get the view
pastu gi walk you walk from one country to another
I don't know some people do that you know okay some people do that but I swear people who do that gila I cannot seh
like that like that that uh I don't know for you know dekat malaysia this um this orang dia jalan daripada to like ipoh or something just to just so that they can see their punya anak cause of COVID
ya I heard something like that like the father literally walked from one state to another just to just so that they can see the anak
just the just the thought of it macam you think tak [leh]
okay lah I mean kau nak jalan buat apa ye you can take the bus you know you're not in the dire situation to walk
mak I
have you no but you know eh uh few recent juga I exercise my mum I go walk from here to jurong east is not as bad as me walking in the reservoir you know I swear walking in the reservoir is way worse I walk from here to jurong east to like JEM to go eat it's not even that bad
I'm not kidding it's really not that bad it's really not that bad bro I literally walk from here to jurong lake garden I really walked with my cousin I walked the whole time daripada this belakang ni I walk sampai jurong lake garden I swear I'm not kidding I that was really a few days after I balik you know
from the bus stop pastu pergi masuk situ eh
go jurong lake garden but then my cousin satu macam let's go then I'm like okay I guess
like aku aku ah aku ingat kita orang akan stop dekat you know the you know there's like a macam park or something behind science garden eh science garden pula science centre
no apparently where where was like aku jalan jauh-jauh that was only five kilometres
ya like half what almost to bila I nak masuk jurong lake garden that was only five kilometres
I was walking I was walking from behind here you know the old block yang dah tak ada
that that's how I follow the route follow the route uh with um ikut pergi science centre
sorry lah baru balik kan I don't know my directions yet pergi JEM pun susah
dude for real oh my god I felt so stupid my mak kan you know how you can tembus from JEM to no no from JEM you can tembus to west gate west gate can go to ng teng fong to
my dumb ass literally my mum suruh I pergi nak cari barang tau but then aku confident dah pergi kat JEM dah beli barang kan pastu you know how there is also another there's also another shortcut from JEM to be big box
I don't know why my stupid my stupid brain went to the shortcut tapi how you know it's close cause the big box also close so I went to I went I saw the sign and it was the the shortcut was closed tau and then I'm like
oh alamak tak boleh jalan shortcut ni then my stupid dumb self literally walk like I really keluar I had to like cross I keluar daripada JEM really cross the road go to
do you understand kau faham tak I was thinking of how that shortcut was going to lead me to even though it's actually big box
I know I I took ah you know actually they close the shortcut then my mum macam huh really dorang tak pernah close pun pastu I was like ya ya ya they close pastu then petang we went again and then we went to westgate then I'm like wait and then my mum is like eh buka apa then I'm like gosh I hate myself
I was so confident I pergi aku jalan and then dia cakap tutup then aku jalan lagi then I'm like okay so it's really close that means I have to like walk like so far away to like from JEM to
I never I never look up you know I just masuk and like
I just need to know my ways see I'm just like not used to going out and that's why actually alone pula tu I'm still getting used to the idea I have to go out alone you know
I've never in my entire life I mean ya I mean okay cause it was saudi so I've never because of saudi I tak boleh keluar like no matter how how old or how young you are like if you are a girl usually cannot leave the house alone
they will get asked by the dajjal
protected it's haram right haram
orang yang not that yang
oh so the the ones yang ada faith and yang ada iman yang kuat they will be they will get protected
oh the real like muslim like one yang betul betul like hold faith
you will be strong enough you akan react out which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself what
no matter how I I think no matter how macam you you even if you pernah experience pun I feel like if it's at that time truly you can never imagine like how you will react unless you for real for real like you can believe in yourself lah like your faith
ya so macam cool seh and australia kan
is it hiroshima yang ada nuclear
is it when you masuk that macam fake rumah then it
like macam what's like apa yang macam
no but I feel like I feel like if uh aku like hopefully not if aku like if ever if there was ever a time where there was an earthquake aku rasa aku akan panic to the point I will not hide under table I will just and then like suddenly everything fall on my head then like
I feel like no matter how much I prepare for something like maybe if it's not enough like I even if I prepare for it like aku aku tak akan when I panic aku tak kan think straight at all
as long as dia boleh protect your head should be fine lah
I mean dia if you you akan obviously kena squish kena squash by the building but as long as you tak kena uh ni apa fracture your head ke apa ke should be okay that's like the most important part what
ya I feel like macam when like when like uh whenever I see macam yang apa earthquake punya macam what's that word macam dia punya aftermath like you know how they find the people in the building semua
the ones alive their their their okay but maybe their kaki yang stuck kat dia punya macam I don't know like a hard apa benda entah
I mean obviously lah earthquake semua ni it's all in god's hand like it can happen anytime whenever it wants to
this COVID jer I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back pun ada the spanish flu which was also like
macam a few decades ago I guess
ya but still macam like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history macam memang tings like this happen like even if it's not common
but it was a big thing in saudi seh in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised aku tak tahu yang SARS is a big thing in middle east
and but I don't think when it happen kat singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
dorang ada vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a macam what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory punya virus
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just orang sakit tiba-tiba
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which aku still tak boleh brain
we have to do an assignment and it was like oh what what do you what what can you write a macam essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self macam like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so gila like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird tak boleh seh
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obviously lah macam I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital gitu
like the one day two day stay that dekat hospital that kind of thing
I tak dengar seh I didn't know that
chey I tak tahu seh I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
so kau nampak yang hospital
how many rumah dorang nak seh there are so many rumah sekarang kat singapore tak apa pun
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like apa saudi I don't know lah basically dorang nak kick out semua foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad suruh I pindah balik kat singapore cause he takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang then like I'm in the middle of school then macam tak baik tak tak nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
but I mean alhamdulilah lah maybe rezeki it's better to also
actually dia kerja sana buat apa eh
no no there's this one type I mean I think it depends like sometimes he kerja in the office and then sometimes like there's this banyak kali aku bau dia punya freaking oil like I really hated the smell bro it like petroleum punya smell like it was so in the house and I thought was going to die you know
for real bau dia kuat gila
pakai oil semua kan
bila time kerja
it's not busuk but it's like you think you so chemically eh
like you you bila you smell you macam oh my god I'm gonna die
but that one is like macam refine oil macam dah
got difference it's like raw black oil so maybe pasal tu bau dia macam weird sikit
ya duh that's the thing no the thing is about oh bila bapa aku balik I I can't even see any stain on him you know
oh no problem lah okay lah kau kan members aku

eh wait but the thing kan but the thing is kenapa dia nak tanya kita pasal intern bila kita dah habis intern and kita intern sama timing pe and now we schooling again
kenapa eh
is it is it supervisor dia orang lelaki or something like that
plymouth ah K that I heard jadi he can actually do it lah but the thing is the main topic sekarang is kenapa dia selalu awak ah
kenapa bukan saya saya yang single awak yang dah attached pe dia cuma message
tak tapi saya expect
okay saya tak expect apa-apa tapi kenapa dia message awak lebih daripada saya ah I think because awak lebih friendly ke awak lebih friendly looking saya garang sikit
awak kena faham eh badan awak petite biasanya siapa yang petite orang lain akan tengok as macam lebih sopan lebih lembut
percayalah saya saya tahu kita sama height tapi
saya lagi besar awak lagi sempurna okay K let's not talk about this okay tak proper kita boleh tukar topik dia K jadi nak saya bilang apa jadi pada saya dah
K kalau awak notice kan kehidupan saya tetap tenang sahaja
tak banyak complication kerana saya tak berbual sangat dengan orang lain jadi saya tidak ada banyak masalah lagi-lagi
okay ya lah tak kelakar okay jadi lepas tu I
nak message ah cakap thank you terima kasih like I usually do that for every outing like even if kita
I go out with you kan I always say macam thanks for today ke apa semua then
nak message dia nak message dia then suddenly dia nowhere to be seen tak boleh nampak profile picture dia cannot even see his contact profile or whatever
then I ingatkan oh maybe whatsapp glitch ah whatsapp glitch jadi
err tak ah kita dah nampak muka each other kita dah nampak then the thing is
my profile picture were tak catfish ah dia punya profile pic pun sama then the thing is he look so cute why why are the cute guys like this
oh dah okay ya basically every single social media platform and then tak nampak dia lagi and
that time lah eh saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa kan online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts ah ghosts I got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa lah ni kehidupan kan manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya
ah tapi dia bising lah
tapi tak semestinya dia lagi tua daripada saya dia apa secucuk how do how do you say that in english ah
jauhkan aku dari adik-adik ya that's true
ah okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
okay faham juga but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course lah mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia kan jadi macam I prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya eh you are my girlfriend seh eh janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
oh my god wait tak
ah apa ah are you serious
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story kan jadi I was also confused lah apa tengah jadi ni then err girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is kan all this time dia baik dengan saya tau dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua err agaknya ah
dengan pelik seh story gitu yang oh lagi satu saya nak bilang ah
bukan bukan nama saya jer yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan kan ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
apa mm mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu lah saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena eh kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu ah saya just diamkan mm
err saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya eh bilang awak tak apa lah nama dia orang semua tapi ni jer lah yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu ah
saya cuma ah nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu lah kita
punya perhubungan ah kalau faham lah jadi ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
a'ah satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that

in the end I I still keep gaining and gaining and gaining masih lah aku punya goals tak capai capai
ya but I want back that body right but okay it's okay reda jer kan apa nak buat
kau kau happy
aku pun happy macam gitu ah
aku aku pun dah malas ah nak jaga jaga sangat
kalau jaga jaga jaga tetap lapar juga so
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here jadi kalau you like told off what if sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup then like kita dah jauh perjalanan kan telah tutup so like
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I ada orang suka bunuh very curious about bunuh ah and then I also like to tengok pokok
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window eh hari ini ada pokok this colour eh hari ini ada salji eh hari ini ada and then like tapi kadang-kadang I fikir macam like
eh then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting ah like err summer panas so like the material lain and then winter sejuk and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about orh the money
and then also like the rumah like
um we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil kan bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about oh so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right I want to bring them to
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not ah countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh lah kita pergi gardens by the bay kan to look at the different flowers and also different uh month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
family is it poor family happy family ah sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like wow so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like err last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana eh nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam I pun fikir lah like wah how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
um nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed lah I also like reality uh so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like wow so this can happen in real life ah then like because like macam I'm quite curious lah on like
people story tapi takkan macam I nak keluar habis tanya orang eh jadi macam mana you punya life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so kaypoh about it
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
ah chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam err
naive and like oh or tapi uh
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when I watch this also I can feel sad lah because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
for me my favourite movie banyak juga lah tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang I suka
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi I tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu I took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok I tu tengah macam ah bekerja ni eh tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata I tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
I think uh also the thing about watching this uh a lot of times with different people right it makes me uh find out more about err the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan ah then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
picked up in this movie so I think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok err with lain orang ah to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like um
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like uh this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like wah damn cool leh macam macam and then like
mm I pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana lah tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive lah it's like
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually bila I dengar soundtrack
sometimes when I watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know uh how the song sound like all that ya what what
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal err
lebih ramai lah jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati blah blah blah and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like masuk dalam and I pakai baju and I tengok cantik ke tak eh and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park wow I don't have to queue eh
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
uh apa ni freeing lah ya freeing then err nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so kan I can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa I kan pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal lah satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu uh
err ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then uh I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like uh I remember uh
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
uh not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to uh a better education he might not get
uh the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles lah
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they ah have to choose between these two and both are important right ah yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya oh ya another thing actually very important uh
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya uh apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat ah
ah petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
okay so my friends and I kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
oh ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening err she has made a lot of friends eh from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
eh awak sini berkebun eh then they ask her eh can I join or not like
for me my hobbies has always been arts lah I really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa kan it's very fun and like uh I think about hobbies
see like uh what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu eh
apa-apa genre lah
kalau lagu melayu kan lagu melayu I ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff lah I think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia kan macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory lah dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan uh actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs lah and it's also by an artist that I really like uh actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi I tak tak pergi alamak
what about like live music err pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga ah ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay oh actually an interesting thing about this was uh
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable lah tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
oh ya I mm what about macam mm ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang kan ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you uh ya do you believe in love at first sight
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik eh
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this ciri-ciri jadi I suka orang ni lah
pelik ya
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish mm how can I don't know about dish lah but I think right for I kan you know my mesti I pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh O ais limau
ya I think uh like teh O ice also I mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu lah mungkin ada tapi I tak tahu ya and oh so um
err apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit jer I think maybe just err what do they eat japchae ah japchae I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate japchae japchae is noodle ya ya
very big ah so I if I were to reach there I calculate lah like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar kan so I remember I I I only bought kacang
habis tu I only ate in taiwan
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax jadi bila I nampak pokok I nampak
uh air air tenteram I tak fikir banyak I boleh dengar
I boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau jer but like there's so many different colours of green
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman
uh for me ah in the future future kan I uh I rasa macam my age lah like my my age right now um is fifty so that means in ten years time I'll be like sixty so sixty it is like more to finding a very uh peaceful kind of um life uh I I just want to enjoy the nature uh macam suka pergi tepi laut lah tepi laut then uh kita tengok apa pokok-pokok uh then um and having uh just a a few number of friends you know
ah you know talk about your you got kids talk about your uh your life about you punya health uh like that lah
ah betul betul betul macam kita nak apa beribadah gitu ah banyak kepada mungkin ukhrawi lah
tapi sebab tu lah nak kena ada macam apa tu orang kata uh barang-barang yang ada kena-mengena dengan sains lah okay okay okay okay okay
dia tengok time lah
martial arts ke action movie because that is really cray you know to me
uh it really like macam excite you uh you really makes you awake tau macam tak mengantuk you know at least at least eh when you watch eh your mind is not really working
uh their apa ni their actions dorang punya lawan-lawan ah martial arts jadi macam
best lah kalau dapat tengok cerita-cerita macam gitu
tapi tu tak selalu sangat lah that one's only like once in a while only but then sometimes you you
you you want to also watch uh like macam family punya kind of
ah kita nak ke mana-mana kita nak pergi apa tu katakan lah pasar ke kita nak berjalan ke mana ke bila kita ada fit body
of of course lah you have the looks you know tapi kalau your body doesn't fit
it's like when you make yourself fit then your body your look also will be like uh macam orang kata tu cerah lah ah macam glowing kan ah glowing so I mean it is
you know or maybe makeup makeup makeup dresses but they forgot about to take care of their health they forgot about uh what to eat and what not to eat you see ah jadi dorang banyak macam ah apa tu tengok lah banyak pergi mana tu uh makan fast food kan ah you see they they they forgot they forgot about the healthy foods
uh they always think yang the important is to to have a good looks you know buat expensive makeup you know and then wear ah good good clothes you know so that they will look good
younger generation need to be educate mesti kena dorang kena kena tahu lah kena banyak membaca
and then ah dorang kena tahu lah you know uh
macam mana nak apa tu ah mencegah penyakit daripada awal bukan macam like when they have already got the sickness they got disease then they will do something then they will try to exercise then they will try to
uh do the prevention then they will try to start to to eat healthy food I think no lah I think from from ya I mean daripada awal dah kena start lah macam choose makan-makanan yang terbaik itu semua
it is not really easy to say lah okay it's not easy to say because we do not know ah what are the experiences that ah you know people uh I mean orang orang orang experience
ah pengalaman orang kan cause everybody has their own experiences ada background yang berbeza
so jadi um this mental health ni
uh I mean okay lah memang makanan tu penting okay that is the most important okay the what you you eat
you know like macam they selit lots of vegetables and fruits you know and don't take too much of sugar ah that is already dah important lah you know because even then
ah secara holistic yes and then
okay but then some people say some people say that uh but I I take vegetables I take also uh I don't drink too much of like canned drinks and all that but I still got mental issue you know ah depression ke apa so I I so I rasa that um
I rasa it is how you manage lah the situation
ah how lah you manage and you did also like macam talk to people uh with with your family you don't keep to yourself
see if you have any problems let's say you youngsters eh macam like when youngsters eh kita tak boleh simpan diri sendiri lah kita kena bercakap dengan orang ah bercakap dengan family tentang masalah kita abeh pilih kawan-kawan yang very menjayai you know
ah jadi sesama lah you tak payah tak ada macam asyik nak fikir tentang masalah you kan
so kadang-kadang orang ni dia boleh accept uh the first degree of stress
yang ada ah second third degree pun masih boleh terima
ah ya depends on dorang punya capacity so I I I think like everyone they must know their limits
and and parents pun tak boleh push ah cannot push them because if they know that their kid they must know they must know and understand whether their kid because if their kid are not the kind yang
mm nak ke mana eh mungkin zaman kanak-kanak lah
mm ye lah kanak-kanak sebab zaman kanak-kanak macam tak ada stress gitu
ah zaman kanak-kanak zaman yang kita tak fikirkan apa-apa ah tak payah nak fikir kita tahu kita makan tidur main dah ah you see I mean
mm uh macam best lah kadang bila kenangkan uh waktu kecil-kecil dulu uh when my late dad was around ah how I spent my time with my dad and then uh apa tu
mm bila kita sama-sama ah apa tu spend time balik kampung you know a lot of things and as a children you don't really think so much lah about like
ah then you woke again then you you like play again you know ah you don't think so much about paying bills you don't think so much about other people punya problems like you have your own problem and you carry out your own problems you know you don't really think about other people punya problems ya macam those memories are I think are the best lah
uh there are some also children they are traumatised by their childhood memories you know that is not good for for for them lah but as for me my own experience um if I have a timer like what you say you know uh where where where do I want to go I nak pergi tu lah the my childhood life lah mm
so jadi um what you say you want to go to the the ages lah okay okay
I think peringkat umur lah eh I think uh that that that is the reason ah why like macam you you are still young you know
orang kata tu pengetahuan nak nak uh kembangkan lagi pengetahuan
uh kan nak expand kan lagi your knowledge so jadi
you rasa sebab you perlu pergi to that ages you know to nak lebih mendalami lagi uh benda-benda yang you tak pasti benda-benda yang you tak tahu mm
apa lagi eh yang kedua ketiga apa eh okay lah yang pertama dulu lah kedua ketiga macam tak tahu lagi nak fikir apa apa lagi nak cakap
oh okay maybe um wang lah ah I think oh I nak jadi seorang millionaire ah bukan sahaja healthy tapi my wish
kalau I ada duit seperti jutawan jadi seorang jutawan ke apa ah I mean not for myself but I think ah I like to help others ya help others and then I like to give I like to give to charity ah I'm a very like macam
then bila kita ada duit tu kita ada ilmu yang banyak ah kita boleh sedekah kita boleh berikan kepada dorang so I think tu yang yang can give me the most satisfaction lah itu second wish lah second wish ya first first first first wish is healthy then second wish uh seorang jutawan ah kaya raya
ah takpe lah you dulu lah what's your first wish and your second and third wish if you have
since I have uh children so of course I I don't really ask ah more like of course lah as a a parent you want to see your children ah succeed in their life you want to see your children like macam
have and will be a successful because the of course that is uh memang tak terkecuali memang you nak tengok anak you berjaya
they are arrogant you know they arrogant towards other people macam sombong gitu macam apa tu
uh tak nak dengar kata orang lain you know macam terlalu ego ke so I
err tidak ada perkara yang uh kekal dekat dunia ni so jadi uh whatever that you have whatever that cherish it lah cherish it and also share share among other people
people will like macam apa tu ah respect you lah respect you
you know ah in this life right manusia manusia ni dorang ah memang akan tengok pandang tinggi lah kepada dorang yang berduit ni semua kan
tapi kalau you berduit tapi you tak ada akhlak pun boleh pandang rendah juga
ah you see so the best thing is uh whatever it is ya buat yang baik lah kalau you ada duit pun tapi you sombong kan
ah so tak ada gunanya lah orang pun people don't look up for you people don't look into you and people don't treat you as a someone that can show a good example to generations you know and people will forget you I mean if people want to remember you yes but people remember you as a person who has who is arrogant ah you know you have a
kalau ada superpower eh kalau ada superpower I nak habiskan kerja rumah dalam satu minit
oh macam flash ah speed lah
ah macam tu macam speed gitu macam whatever that I want uh I do eh I want to do in a very fast manner
then I I I clean up the house right like macam wah habis one minute gone or two minutes wah all the house clean already semua dah bersih wah see I I I
uh I mean like then you can have apa orang kata tu relax lama-lama
ah rehat lama-lama ah but unfortunately I do not have that such power
um tapi kalau ada
you know like mac also you also using your phone don't need to you know like last time you use uh apa
ah you know senang semua but okay dulu kalau nak masak kita nak kena fikir buku pastu flip flip flip the pages ah sekarang tak payah sekarang ah sekarang ah you tengok jer youtube
ah you google jer okay nak cari resipi apa masak apa ah then you know from then on can you can already uh find the recipe that you want
main problem like contohnya I think for adults eh adults should be okay because they already know how to use the phone they know ah they know when to use it you know uh they they know like macam when not to use it you know they they they have the orang kata tu tahu bila nak focus tapi kalau children memang talking budak-budak ni you see when they are already get used to phones at an early age eh
you have TikTok and dorang dah lah macam malas sekejap macam sekejap-sekejap nak tengok TikTok sekejap-sekejap nak nak nak apa nak buat TikTok kan
ah kerja rumah semua terbengkalai then homework pun terbengkalai kan and then uh last time eh you see uh budak-budak dulu they want to watch the television they they if they want to on the television their parents will scold them eh cannot watch television ah you haven't finish your homework now they watch youtube also you do not know because the phone is with them ah you see so
ah you yourself you think how you because you yourself ask you to sleep you don't want to sleep you see you are you you you suka tengok youtube you suka tengok netflix ah lagi sekarang netflix selalu dekat phone ah you see susah kan kadang-kadang
nak nak nak stop ataupun kita nak ketepikan mm handphone tu
um pun ada good and bad dia lah maybe maybe I understand that people they are using this is to maybe cut cost
of uh you know human skills and all that but then when you think about it kan kalau were to take over humans kan then what humans going to do you know certain things boleh lah kan certain things I think um can you know take over humans tapi certain like macam profession tak boleh take over humans ah you know I think certain certain professions lah not all professions you know macam doctor you that's why boleh jadi doctor ah macam mana jadi doctor
I rasa patient tengok pun takut takut dengan dengan dengan ah you see ataupun nurses take over nurses I I don't think so lah that's why I tell you macam certain professions uh memang tak kena lah kalau I mean take over
still need uh you know human ya you still need human touch you know human skills you know and then can you imagine kalau take over abeh kita ni nak kerja apa ah you know how to earn money like that
see so kalau macam humans kan lain humans kan ah humans ada limitation ah dia macam sponge kan humans dia boleh adjust
ah you see so ye lah and and to add to that and to add to your ini kan questions you tengok macam ah apa maid pembantu rumah
ah you see you are not going to to let the to become the maid of the house right ah you know like in terms of like cleaning up maybe lah can but then in terms of you talking about eh taking after the old people don't know uh how to how to really like macam like you say lah human touch they lack of that
use use the app for for macam good purpose lah I think for cleaning up no problem because like like macam you talking about cleaning up there's not much of like macam uh I mean skills yes you must have the skills but not so much of like macam
uh thoughts to put into it you know when you do cleaning up um like macam uh you do the job cleaners and all that uh simple simple job can take over lah
uh you know but other jobs that require uh you know you need deep thoughts ataupun kemahiran ah macam kemahiran yang orang kata tu yang yang besar kan macam doctor dia punya kemahiran dia betul-betul besar kan so takkan you nak suruh take over kan mm you see
tengok lah tengok kepada keperluan pada keadaan pada keperluan pada keadaan memang when you talk about technology in years to come ah macam-macam kan technology akan datang so jadi uh we'll see lah that
mana yang lebih perlu lah at which at which sector
rather than you know like sekarang sahaja orang dah macam-macam ada banyak masalah mental problem sekarang I think kalau ada kita nak adakan lagi um orang kata untu menggantikan uh all the professions uh orang akan ada banyak lagi masalah mental health problem
mm and and and one thing and one thing pun I think um if you nak have this right untuk menggantikan the soldiers pun not bad so that you you don't use so many soldiers let's say you go to war ah kan tak ada ramai lah human beings yang mati mm

eh you ada assignment is it
then suruh jer lah dia teman you lunch ah
so now he's still marah
then jumpa lah dia accompany you belajar like go to err Starbucks or something
ya I like to go Starbucks dekat buona vista you know that Starbucks
cause tadi tadi we went to do the simulator
ah the simulator is very fast I think around macam twenty minutes gitu
ya it's it's damn stupid the simulator is damn bodoh like you ugh you should go for the simulator it's so it's such a waste of time they just wanna take your money that's all
ya but I think this sekarang two B nak kena ambil simulator kan
then oh then the apa</malay>[ah] time simulator tu they there was one part uh we were riding kononnya under the influence of alcohol
ah ya so stupid so dia nya screen dia macam
ya like fuzzy but still tiba-tiba the car on the right swerve into our lane then become our fault they say oh this is what happens when you driving under err influence of alcohol you cannot predict err accident
ya ya that's why suddenly you know the car swerve into our into our lane then I got I got a macam flashback of my accident that time yang time chinese new year
orh the parents asyik suruh kita balik like oh ah kita masakkan ni kita masakkan tu then kau balik lah makan kalau kau tak nak balik then kita tak buat kan you know that kind of thing
then you will rasa like feel bad what
I macam tak nak go home for dinner
oh my god hari-hari I makan benda sama babe kat rumah like it's always ah ada telur ada ikan ada prawn and it's like that every single
simon suka apa
my mum's today because every week week then we balik sana right so sometimes dia makan sana then I balik I tak makan
like balik bishan then I tak makan then macam I feel bad lah cause
ya then simon also kadang don't eat at my parent's but most of the time he will come home and eat at my place then he will balik and then he will eat again so that's why he become fat already
ada exam soon is it
four modules ya four modules is quite heavy though considering you ada full time job and
he he tak he's not studying right he's just working kan
oh so he expects macam the same the same thing lah
oh gitu but lain what
is baru tujuh minit seh
ya I think dalam tujuh tujuh minit gitu
mmhmm tapi kita hang out kita berbual pasal you know like tu
I mean I'll okay jer kalau nak berbual pasal you know
then sekolah is like um two point five years
anything happens and then I ada sekolah or then I also nak cari kerja what
ya I already like send out resumes and stuff tapi most tak get back
I apply for macam dental assistant like reception slash dental assistant and then there's also uh patient service associate
apa lagi I apply for reception uh
because I tak nak clashed dengan simon punya if I wanted like a shift job I dah police lah like what I wanted to do right
tapi ya like so far tak get back
ya no he's is err office hour paling lambat pun maybe around seven or kadang-kadang he on course night training then he will come home late lah but it's never
macam eat into the weekends unless uh on course or he ada duty ah then those are the times when it will eat into his weekends
ya and then plus apa
like shift job tak kesah apa like ke tak ke like you still need to go and work what
oh yes yes yes yes dia ada it's like morning but it's split into two right I remember you
I very macam um quite err
pressured lah cause like kadang-kadang the kakak will ask me
ah kau tak nak cari kerja ke as in not not directly macam kau tak nak cari kerja but more like um kau nak buat apa sekarang like oh uh kau kau sekarang nak masuk sekolah like you know this kind of thing then I I've I rasa macam a bit pressured lah it's not macam I'm not looking for a job all like I enjoy being at home and not doing anything
I kalau I pergi balik pun I tak nak jadi manager anymore lah it's very it was very shitty
and then sekarang pun they already increase um part-time punya pay to I think eight
ya I know right then dorang increase I lupa lah I punya pay berapa but I think I was paid nine for a manager role
sebab I can send simon to work
and then I boleh pergi kerja dari sana because he cannot ride to work mah
ya then only during this course yang they kasi him ride his bike tapi he's he's gonna end his course soon on twenty
err tak tahu eh he cakap nak naik bus tapi naik bus is very very far for him
ya is jauh gila
ya then cakap nak boleh tak kalau kita tinggal dekat rumah your
kita kat sana kita tinggal kat hall seh babe kat tilam and then for five days you wanna
like kita ada our own macam room at bishan and then macam I I don't feel comfortable lah kalau macam everytime I'll have to like sleep in in the hall
with him then macam no privacy you know
ya then I say don't want lah like I don't mind to macam pagi-pagi you ambil I punya bike you pergi sungei gedong then after that I from there I go back my mum's place is okay lah for me I mean at least he doesn't have to like wake up so early to take the bus cause he he punya reporting time is pukul like tujuh sometime enam setengah then pukul berapa nak keluar rumah you know
sungei gedong you tahu um kubur sana
like pusaraman
ya lim chu kang but lagi dalam
ah my house is very near to his workplace tapi takkan I nak duduk sana lima hari kan
oh my god no dia takkan kasi punya girl
she won't lah dia tak kasi punya lah dia tak kasi lah my sister is damn difficult to talk to she won't even have a conversation with me about her school
ya and then uh he cakap um nak kena tunggu dia habis tour dia baru
err he will maybe pergi nee soon camp then it will be closer to his workplace already eh I mean his house tapi
ya mandai but it's lagi lama lah lagi maybe around one year one point five years
cause dorang tak kasi ride bike right abeh macam orang regular seh ya exactly the dia punya tempat kerja tu tak kasi the naik motor like everyone in dia punya
uh what do they call name battalion I guess err tak boleh naik motor you can only naik public transport atau you take your own car
ya and that's why it pressures me so much like you keep talking about having a car having a car then I belum kerja seh kita belum apply rumah belum kerja then you nak talk about having a car
a'ah I think you you you nak kena fikir about it's not just about petrol tau about like dia punya season parking berapa dia punya road tax berapa
ya that's why dia punya season parking dia punya ah apa what's that called ah road tax then your monthly instalment for your insurance it's just like ah
I don't know I tak tahu apa is going on in his head that he thinks
ya macam I find tak
makes sense lah if you nak if you nak apa ni ah restrict from uh riding bikes it's fine but he works there for five days abeh lepas tu kau tak kasi orang tu naik motor abeh lepas tu kau suruh orang tu naik bus
tak boleh because this thing is not um macam baru baru jer they say oh you cannot ride but it's been like years already it's this to this to this macam they don't want to change it lah
ya it's damn kesian ah I see
then after that dia cakap nak bangun pagi nak naik bus jauh sia babe even I nak balik rumah I'd rather take my motorbike go home to choa chu kang apa lagi dia yang nak kena pergi kerja
dah lah satu bus jer pergi sana abeh it's also together with like the
ya and bus kat that that bus nine seven five tu oh my god
they dah lah tak cater the bendy bus or the double decker bus and then it's always full you have to like miss two or three buses to to like ya
mm mm ya you're not really affected by macam
like the economy but I mean affected a bit lah it's not like you retrenched lah macam bonus dia tak dapat for mid-year bonus
ya civil servant kan tak dapat
err dia kena retrenched
with his pay and then him supporting me it's it's not so bad the only reason why it's a bit macam
macam it feels like we're we're living from pay cheque to pay cheque is because of our wedding is on hold
tapi tak tak confirmed juga apa kalau we masih hold the wedding in december cause like I don't think the government is gonna like move into phase three
oh ya ya ya tapi
hais just I I I macam nak cancel the malay wedding honestly ah tak kesah also to like ah don't have the malay wedding
no I serious I tak kesah pun not to have the malay wedding sebab
leceh sia babe like already kahwin sia like it's no point I don't see a point in having a malay wedding anymore
but I already nikah macam tak tak perlu sia
just tak perlu lah babe serious I dah nikah abeh lepas tu um
ya I tahu I cakap that you know I have a baby next year but you know you never know when you have a baby and then kalau I let's say eh around maybe uh next month or what by december perut I dah besar babe like macam mana nak naik pelamin then kalau in that case I betul-betul pregnant by the time I nak ada a majlis
I punya perut dah besar then I nak kena tunggu I beranak dulu
I dah beranak I nak kena tunggu lagi I punya confinement nak kena settle down my my child and then bila nak ada the wedding tak perlu
I nak pergi nak suruh tolong
I pergi sengkang punya
I nak pergi lah nak appeal lah suruh dorang return I punya deposit lah sebab um dorang tak kasi I punya deposit balik
oh my god I punya I punya catering did I tell you about it
I punya catering oh my god was so freaking difficult they were so difficult with me
so at that point in time boleh ada uh majlis kan
so I punya invitation is two three hundred
so uh that time government kasi sampai two hundred and fifty so you can still have a wedding and everything
ah so I cakap dengan dorang lah ah err okay I still nak go on with the wedding ah tapi invitation two hundred fifty and I tak minta balik I punya duit cause I paid for three hundred pax right so I tak minta balik the fifty that um I paid for tapi I nak you
um macam
err so I I just say that lah then dorang cakap uh they almost made me sign the contract and then say that okay boleh kita boleh err have the wedding tapi all the social distancing shit ah you settle
ya so ambil temperature semua you settle
mana boleh gitu sia babe
ya and then apa ni I paying you extra tau then after that dia cakap ah
ya dia punya contract basically saying kalau betul you punya wedding ada um COVID case ah you kena handle everything by yourself so I don't want to take liability for this at all ya and then dia cakap um
kita still akan cook three hundred pax for you
ya so basically saying I'm going to ah I'm still gonna give you what uh you paid for tapi everything else kau settle like if there's anything that happens during your wedding you are liable for it the bride and groom liable for it and they made me sign the
tak lah I tak go on ah then after that uh they I think dorang tak rugi sebab that time kan tutup
then dorang tak boleh beli their barang from there what so they have to buy it from singapore what
and then after that I cakap dengan dorang lah I give like kata putus like that I say um
kalau sampai end of the year ah I still cannot have my wedding then you return my money sebab if you think about it eh duit yang I down dengan dorang belum pakai tau
like you all tak beli barang basah
like basically you all tak tak tak pakai ah duit tu
then the the basically you didn't spend ah my money I'm just paying for the instalment nasib baik I tak pay full ah dorang
so dorang punya dorang punya
I don't know sebab I dah bayar up until the last payment so that one is the after after wedding
because the payment pasal dah nak dah nak my wedding seh masa tu
ya I bayar I think err
cause three payments only I make three payments then the last payment is like after the majlis itself lah
ya so I dah bayar dorang
photographer yang dah bayar I still ada mak andam yang dah bayar
um for malay wedding ya that's all kompang I dah bayar as in like I already deposit lah
so I think maybe if if I tak pergi and tulis I punya deposit maybe almost eight K
ya ya exactly like no service is delivered how can you say macam they suffered losses like what losses there was nothing delivered
macam I tak touch anything I tak touch anything at all then how what what losses are you talking about when you didn't deliver anything there was no services delivered I didn't get any product

that the good thing about that area is all  semua connected by train
ya so  kita just  naik the train from paris you go all the way to brussels
then spend half a day there then  patah balik
um then from there I actually we actually went to  apa ni manchester tengok bola ya I'm a big big fan lah
I will I will never leave I will never leave ah london without going to manchester and watching one game oh okay talking about that my profile photo  yang uh  tengah main bola lah  tu kan
uh  dulu Uber was in singapore

 macam mana eh  nak kalau ah dah eh  kalau salah salah tak dapat apa-apa buang masa kan ah then ah  cakap okay lah nevermind ya ya ah
then I saw on this cardboard ah gambar manchester  gambar of the city and then they on the bottom they said you are going to manchester
ah then I was dah stun ah  tengok dalam hati
 apa ni takde benda apa macam ingat macam boot or apa ah player one of the player sign the boot or something because is is like a shoebox size
 bukak cardboard  apa itu aja but it didn't hit me you know I was was waiting  macam very slow reaction was like
what like  terus dah  terlompat-lompat kat situ

you have to believe it I it happen lah so I told her the whole story lah then after like ten minutes of talking to her  dia cakap alif  kalau dah  lambat cakap aja lambat tak payah come up with all these stories
 cakap ah are you sure
so ah I just had that as my proof so-called proof so I  balik I told my wife my wife  pun tak percaya

I woke my wife ah you see you see  tengok see is real I'm not lying I'm not dreaming is real

we so we we went for one week lah that was time of my life man ya  jumpa
player free travel free hotel everything I just need to spend  duit belanja lah
from from mana ah ah
if central central paris ke the outskirts
ah ah ah okay the  ada eiffel tower
that that that time we  kita pergi night train from london
so  kita jalan lah  jalan around the area
jalan from the train the the
train  semua what what's the train say the
ah  jalan through the streets know sightseeing always  sampai the
um yup then some ya pernah but okay lah they are they are okay ah
then from there ah yup ah  satu naik stroller ah  satu the the smallest one ah ah mm
ya ya ya ya banyak halal ya ya correct
 dari from  apa ni the loop  kita naik dia ada apa the the river tour eh
ah river tour the the sand sand river all that  semua ah ah
ah ya ya ah ah we are  kita punya is just the the sightseeing just the  duduk-duduk tengok-tengok
ah then then  situ kira macam rest lah
we still have the picture the exact same picture that uh it was that was on the news  yang dah  terbakar
architecture we ah  kita kita jalan ah all the way  jalan
apa from from gare du nord  jalan around the area
the english guys oh  paris is dirty but to me  dua-dua equally dirty the difference is paris has ah more sightseeing places
the the  dekat-dekat first ah
then there's there's this  apa shopping mall  baru lah  apa nama dia they
 dorang betul-betul cater  untuk singaporeans but because I went there
 besar-besar lah the poster uh you can use Nets here Nets is a singapore thing what right so
literally every shop in that mall I think is paradigm ah I I can't remember the name you  boleh pakai Nets so it's obviously catered for singaporeans what
mm  nak kena tukar
buat crochet jer kan tapi aku macam nak try
benda other than just macam bag pasal aku nak jual a few bags
tapi macam I want to try cardigan lah skirt
tapi aku takut because I need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
to macam
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
cause I don't have like banyak content cuma aku aku post apa yang aku ada dulu
tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya self bukannya orang beli then macam
sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku jer I don't know how to macam reach out to
because you know Instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar aku tak ada duit dah lah aku tak
uh hobby punya expenses kan so ya
but tak ada duit so what's the things yang kau nak try
aku start pasal aku ada duit kan so aku the first step I did was aku beli mesin
that step I felt very macam alamak abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli ruler
but I I still have not macam masuk class atau macam any course yang will teach me
professional way ya so I think itu pun aku nak kena belajar so kalau if you want to join me
I think we can always join yang macam you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
yang I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like uh but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
aku nak join the highest level the terus buat baju kurung that one you know
yang that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
I think that one also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like macam after school uh part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents punya
ya aku pun rasa sama I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many macam kedai dorang semua sama like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon ah they hyping all these kedai too much no offence
I saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
like basic gila tote bag dia abeh ada macam embroidery macam
macam pathetic ah to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like oh my god like I can do so much better
and some more kita kan daripada artistic punya course
ya that's why that's why um apa ni
that's why because because dekat Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always kita selalu macam bilang you are artist you you gonna charge
punya harga mahal it's a piece of art it's a service people not tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu pe
so just charge lebih jangan jangan cause some more kalau kau charge low nanti other artist kena macam compare macam then the customer macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila
ya that one satu lah itu betul
apa ni benda-benda simple gitu
okay lah like I I guess rezeki dorang lah you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine atau machine just help you stitch atau
is it tulis letter punya atau
mm mm pasal my brother dia selalu buat commission work
so orang yang order dia punya commission work is like kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia
tapi dia pergi charge murah seh like A four
oil paint eh not oil acrylic punya paint they charge twenty dua puluh dua puluh dolar jer hello I'm
untuk dia senang lah memang untuk dia senang dia dia draw satu kali satu malam pun dah habis
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap
benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang there's people out there yang charge benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau just macam
aku agaknya tak confident lah eh macam insecure macam aku nak jual tote bag aku berapa
macam mahal sangat kawan that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think kita people like us kalau nak
buat benda-benda gini we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in macam style no offence
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing macam no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals semua macam they all have the same style
scrunchie ada banyak kedai scrunchie
pasal scrunchie senang nak buat
just uh just kain straight abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi scrunchie ya
boleh lah
tak professional
but I like how macam sekarang punya Instagram shop is like a baru punya like a new platform to jual and you don't have to take rent right itu satu
macam kedai physical kedai ah tapi dorang pun aku follow a few kedai yang buat baju
so kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak stock up
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
baju ya I think that's very important
satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat eh I can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
apa kejadah tu free size
how can anybody have the same baju badan like kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya
size jauh sangat tapi kau kan tinggi sikit
M S S tu pun macam okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just S M and L
ya what about all those people yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam
apa ni grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
which is like lagi mahal lah
ah tu pasal
lagipun sekarang macam kita our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation kan
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
so banyak orang choose to beli
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju kan kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam smaller than people so kalau banyak orang yang macam
besar sikit then macam mana dorang nak like
sustainable dorang nak macam oh macam long don't buy from fast fashion tapi actually fast fashion pun baju semua kecil lah tapi
ya that's why aku suka sangat dengan this new macam trend of kedai Instagram yang buat
custom fit is I think is very important I think kalau aku boleh jahit I think that's one of my goal macam
I like it's always at the back of my head to buka kedai baju lah actually tapi just I don't have the necessary
skill tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak seh aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai like yes
like yes the baju really is your baju it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your apa
your apa ni
and like lagipun baju yang tailor is always last longer
tahun pasal kan ada tag ada nombor tau and nombor dia belum nombor singapore yang
modern punya you know macam nine tu ya number dia lima or something like that how old is that ya
pasal pasal um
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting kan thrift is macam cheap murah
so kalau kau sustainable is when you buy something that already exists tapi macam at the same time
ah so you don't have to buat benda baru so it's not wasteful lah kirakan tapi kalau vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is mahal hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people apa seh T-shirt one hundred dollar tapi macam is
it got it got apa ni is valuable is got context ah there there's a history to it
uh uh abeh yang thrifting ni secondhand murah macam kat lucky plaza pasal is
people tak nak I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people nak ke tak nak is demand versus supply lah that's what makes the price
so ya I think kalau orang confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price kalau two dollar that's not vintage macam
oh ya lagipun
benda yang kita kena tanya ni actually kenapa baju sekarang murah
what makes it so like orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah
cause there's actually a cause behind that murah you know
until very sad that's why aku macam sekarang aku dah hundred percent
uh prevent myself daripada beli baju dari Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru lah actually pasal
actually no offence tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju and baju kau semua lawa semua my size like I want to give people like I want to macam kasi kasi tapi alamak lawa pula pakai lah
abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar family aku dorang semua pakai baju kau sia
you give me I I wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung kan dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
dia kasi aku so aku selalu ada these people around me yang akan kasi baju but then I I don't think other people
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I ada orang tanya aku pasal this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get baju yang macam
bukan fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion tapi actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad tapi susah lah kan tapi ya I also don't have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau tu jer
ye pasal kan actually kalau kau fikir fikir balik kan all this um wasteful punya life
cepat sangat is like so fast like it's sudden
macam actually kita yang boleh nampak lah the drastic changes actually dulu-dulu
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish lelaki dia nak create plastic bag pastu dia nak
dia nak he wants it to be a more sustainable uh alternative tau
dia tak nak pakai tree dia tak nak pakai paper bag pasal is from trees
abeh dia tak nak pakai macam cloth bag because it's uh to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is macam oh macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang
kita salah guna lah kita ada convenience kita buang after every use which is
crazy to me disposable how can satu benda kau buat susah-susah
terus kau buang plastic bag macam factory kena
lagi kalau kau belajar chemistry you know how all this thing is created daripada element dorang semua
kalau if you really look from the root kan kau macam oh my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
so going back to yang cakap pasal kedai Instagram and orang sekarang banyak buat benda
the uh it's a like bagus yang orang sekarang uh try their best untuk belajar all these skills balik buat apa ni
just buat benda-benda simple lah tapi at least dorang ada apa
ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini once you buat you akan
hargai you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
once you because we are so jauh daripada the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people kita tak
tak macam eh a'ah eh macam mana macam sayur sayur orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang
it's actually not our fault lah it's just how time has changed abeh macam tapi alhamdulilah kita dapat this
ilham this know in our head that we get to apa ni
belajar lah just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware jer I think we just more aware of everything
satu satu pending belum bayar
agaknya lah
is it lagi mahal dorang akan
macam kat mana-mana advertisement tu or what
explore page nanti ada keluar kan
explore page ada macam yang fashion
shopping all that tu kan
pasal actually ada satu dua orang tanya macam berapa gitu tapi dorang overseas then
actually I can I can ship overseas tapi dorang macam oh okay thank you pasal I I think they prefer to buy local lah obviously leceh kan
cause actually crochet kat singapore ada a few kedai crochet kat singapore you know the farah lola that one
ya that one but then it's like to me I don't really like singapore punya crochet punya
design design wise they more like for public friendly eh macam colour dorang macam
black grey tapi crochet it's still crochet but it's just like not as like my style lah
ya it's not like quirky ya pasal kat banyak seh kedai
macam banyak gila and it's all so cute and I like most of it I like inspired from from dorang ah
aku tengok dorang that's why aku nak macam I think that's a good thing about social media kau tengok alamak what am I doing so kau pun
lagipun kedai tu dia actually she used to work at kedai kain pastu pandemic kedai tu tutup
so dia selalu bawa balik kain yang dorang tak nak tau just scrap it's it's kirakan scrap tapi banyak lah
so dia bawa balik abeh dia collect over time abeh waktu pandemic ni dia jahit
dia jahit bag just simple bag it's all shoulder bag
lagipun dia dia baru graduate daripada university of textile or something like that ah
so I like her rezeki like so good lah pasal dia start baru waktu tu yang quarantine tu
abeh banyak orang beli habis tu sekarang all of her kain is dead stock
you know dead stock kain like no more like it's just orang tak nak macam she's already
her lining all recycled uh ah not recycled apa ni
cute she make it cute lah then the kain not that cute tapi she make it cute
abeh sekarang dia ada lagi satu size kau nampak
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh it's like big
ya alamak I think one day aku beli ah
tapi susah nak order tu dia drop terus kau kena order
pasal dia punya collection dia tak akan buat balik pe dia satu kali jer
aku pun nak buat gitu tapi kalau buat gitu then aku kena constantly come up with new things
kau tahu tak tapi kalau orang nak yang itu aku macam ah okay lah aku buatkan kau pasal I obviously I want money right
aku cuma buat aku tak tahu apa plan for my
aku pun nak buat gitu but then
aku punya followers tak banyak sekarang so
tu lah actually kau tahu farah lola kan dia punya design satu jer
cuma colour lain
so like everytime dia nak buat kan they just buat that thing and it's like how to say ah
design dia satu jer so kalau imagine
and she will drop that thing she will drop and say okay hari ni aku jual hari ni korang boleh pre-order
order that ah senang kalau kau punya design satu jer
so you can keep doing that same design so you can stock up lah kirakan aku nak made to order actually if can that's why it's a bit
so like that's why ya aku hundred percent will like
I don't know how long it can last tapi macam kalau ada kain it will be more durable
it will be more durable tapi kalau cardigan kan there's not much weight to it kau taruk kat badan kau pe tapi kalau bag kau letak botol
taruk botol tapi it will stretch ah eventually no matter how tight I make it you know
ya then macam quite fun lah because aku follow a few crochet punya kedai and they all so supportive they always share story of the design they like
then got this one kedai she daripada philippine then she say oh uh
uh reply this if you are kedai then I will promote what um the my my best the the my favourite post of you abeh since aku buat tu dia dia
post kat dia punya story abeh like a few crochet philippine punya account also quite cute ya
just happy to see orang singapore
creative so kita
ya even tengok orang pakai baju pun sedih I mean like bukan baju lawa tapi then macam err selipar pakai seluar pendek
tak boleh aku pet peeve ah
knit ke knit
kawan aku buat accounting punya course
sorry maths aku
kau interested dengan benda ni
actually aku nampak banyak job posting dekat job street about
ya I think kalau kau join kerja sekarang with that related job I think kau boleh start dari sana
like you don't have you don't really have to study like ya an alternative lah lagi kau hands on ah ya
arts arts kalau tak ada pandemic pun orang tak nak tapi the need for it lah
dorang ada tuesdays with morrie
abeh ah while the rest ada I don't know ah this city city got show I don't know what is it
I was supposed to uh kerja untuk hotel tau
you know hotels has the such a big show it's like the biggest show like selalu cakap kalau kau boleh kerja hotel kau boleh kerja apa-apa
production pasal is like four hours long like that then like the dresser is A and B you know
so kau ada shift so like oh my god aku takut lah waktu dia cakap ah you want to go hotel then I'm like yes but then I just yes cause I need job right
nasib baik tak ada tak tau nasib baik ke tak
kalau ya seram tapi kalau ya pun wah macam what an opportunity right ya
ya like hotel banyak gila cast then like all the cast is like
orh the third aku baru tengok crazy rich asians
okay lah cerita dia mm not my type lah
awkwafina pun vietnam eh ke korean
entah lah but they just take all and all kind of asian they can take in hollywood lah
okay lah I guess they we're going somewhere the representation tapi macam nampak force sikit ah
and this thing waktu tu aku dengan kakak aku adik aku macam heated heated argument
do we really want representation kalau representation gini macam hijab
macam okay kalau korang step macam diverse tapi macam there's not much
depth into that diversity just macam show off yang oh
show kita ni diverse then macam
some more like apa ni
if like if you kalau kau include orang pakai tudung like just example
kau tak payah taruk plot there something like culture what you don't have to keep like throwing to the audience like oh she's the muslim she's a she's a muslim like can you just like
talk about her like any other character macam okay macam do more about her personal punya character development whatever orh tak payah macam
cina jer cina jer ni martial arts
macam can you really you can just make a show cerita apa yang bagus
cerita ni a good place quite good ah good place
like they never even they never really macam
cause ada ni kan jamil is it is that what you call her
jameela apa nama dia the yang manny
ah nama dia jason jason ah yes
cerita tu tak payah macam force it's not force what but if if you really look at the cast macam quite diverse what
but that one tak macam oh
oh you know tak payah
cerita apa eh
it's bodoh
I saw someone I I saw a interview you know anthony padilla from smosh last time dia interview siapa perempuan tu yes
so dia ada buat porn pakai tudung abeh oh my god it's like so
macam how to say it's like very popular so it says a lot you know
oh my god sia I mean like it it's not kesian ah actually aku dengar interview dia sedih
dia buat sikit jer sia
dia cakap dia buat macam six video or whatever ah like macam ya
okay lah tu lain cerita ah
it's just perempuan dengan lelaki just different
no kalau kalau if you ever come across lelaki yang like like bothered by this
let's say he he he want to macam argue no lelaki pun but no don't even argue because
kalau kau bukan orang tu kalau kau bukan part of that
uh group you shouldn't be sort of defensive what kita bukan punya
kita bukan cakap yang kau kau pervert kau semua pervert bila masa cakap gitu
kita just cakap what's fact it's been decades since
macam tak payah cakap isn't it obvious macam adik aku sometimes gitu pasal adik aku dia
dia annoyed with modern feminism dia cakap
macam you know all this perempuan yang bogel kat street dekat lah all this but then you you shouldn't you shouldn't look at the at the
surface you shouldn't look at the surface tu apa dorang buat jer tapi you should really look at the cause the issue you know ni macam jauh sikit tapi aku nak compare pasal aku suka tupac kan
suddenly tapi banyak orang macam oh black people they are gangster cakap pun macam
pekik-pekik maki-maki each other tapi dia cakap dia there's there's one thing he say very like really got to me he say if you cannot
like the problem is dorang like how they even become like that you know
you know macam how perempuan become so aggressively err berbogel ni ah why they make it until that point you know
ya sedih apa abeh lagi malay drama's not helping
ya allah I don't know how at this day of age people can still produce that kind of show
kahwin contract
malay punya drama kahwin jer itu dorang punya conclusion eh kau tak nak kahwin nanti kau tak boleh kahwin itu jer
oh my god kahwin sia apa-apa problem kau ada kau kahwin
and kalau tak ada anak tu tak apa and like ni semua lain orang punya masalah lain tapi you should really look at the rezeki that you have
instead of we don't have I mean like memang manusia biasa kita selalu macam apa yang kita tak ada we really look
instead of buat cerita suruh orang kahwin kenapa tak buat cerita suruh dorang hargai apa yang dorang ada what the shit eh sorry
abeh nyai aku tengok ketawa-ketawa abeh nyai aku I don't know if she like it or she just like amused by how bad it is
pasal aku suka tengok cerita korea korea is like more in depth like they have a lot of issues
people always say eh you know very sad you know eh nak kat habis eh apa tu kita habis
kau buat apa the whole day
then bila I dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya uh isteri right
actually I don't know asal dorang break up ah eh asal dorang nak
cerai everything
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam wow he found the one
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
and I rasa macam
kalau I Bella I pun maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
ya they got back together I think time bulan ramadan I think they got back together that which make me feel macam
don't ah jangan lah judge and everything then I was like oo okay
actually that time I terserempak dia then when I saw him right
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel kesian cause he looks very like
entah lah maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know ah dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
buat kot cause like
ya I mean no harm trying ah sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
from ten to twelve I have like uh group consultation then from twelve onwards is um ten minute consultation with my professor then after that dah balik
no lah like I can balik but at the same time macam I got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
uh should be kat rumah lah cause sekolah like
ya no fast err there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
but it's okay lah cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then I just
okay lah bila I first datang right
I feel a bit macam intimidated
asal you tak sabar I thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
to have like a sense of security kat sana
ah cause I rasa lonely kat sekolah
macam cause most of kita nya classes online kan then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
the example eh macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang dah habis week
macam kanchiong habis
dorang actually kat sekarang
ah nama dia start with letter L
and dia punya kawan uh I think nama dia start letter B
you know I I nak beli baju daripada Shein you know Shein
I tak ada baju seh pergi sekolah
although I pergi sekolah dua hari jer every week
in your like situation memang susah nak save tau actually
for like kerja kan is just for you untuk
maybe one hundred you simpan
you know I rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I rasa macam I've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
dah bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
you know I feel kan untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
cause eh I haven't finish cakap lah
okay then takpe kot
can buy him sabun
ya I mean if you want it easy then just baju eh then just uh perfume lah
uh I think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
but at the same time I rasa dia boleh lah
takde lah I mean
that time he met Dakshah also sebab I tak free
huh I very like packed with a lot of things eh I got I struggling with school takde time ah
but it's really difficult to ajar him seh cause
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul kan budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
is very taxing penat seh
I ah boleh
ya I mean people always cakap alah jer pe
to secondary and secondary is like macam
I'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
wah like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be seh
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
actually I scared seh sebab you know uh recently I nampak kat news kan macam
budak kecil right eh not budak kecil ah like just like lower secondary everything
dorang um they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase eh like it's damn
oh primary school pun
social media ah macam TikTok
and I just tak faham ah cause like I remember that time
err ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap lah like ah jangan buat malu keluarga ah jaga maruah keluarga
and then dia macam cakap ah macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then I just feel that err they don't really understand
cause secondary school kan kita tak pernah lambat seh kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
Afif tak pernah lambat ah
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
cause of her macam
ya I cannot seh dia seriously something wrong with her
I mean if you realize like those macam
there were like macam camne nak cakap eh
mm you know I rasa kan the best coach yang I ada right was actually my Singapore poly nya coach they were really like
and although I macam tak datang training atau I not that good kan dorang still never stop believing in me seh
and then dorang always cakap macam oh Ayra you can do this blah blah blah like that
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise kan actually tak healthy gila seh
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday I ke
I suka um
actually I suka mixed ah you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at macam
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and I and then macam ada purple sikit and then I rasa macam oh my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
oh actually kan I takut seh nak simpan flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila I simpan flowers kan banyak cicak masuk bilik I seh
cicak lipas then flies
but you know ah I don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called Antea Social
and then they sell like cakes ah oh my god bila I nampak I macam whoa macam sedap jer
macam nak pergi seh but confirm mahal
if I cannot like macam give birth or what right
I should be open to having anak angkat ah cause like
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel macam tak comfortable
ya I tak comfortable I think in a way because like
someone punya
kenapa would you consider
but would you nak would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can ah pelihara like
kucing when I dah besar but when I think about it right
I don't know seh it really depends ah whether I have time to jaga them or not
oh my god actually right last time I pergi rumah kawan I cause dia ada rabbit
and then like macam
dorang bising tau
I okay with zoo seh cause I feel yang macam
uh ya it's true ah yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
oh my god adik I think you're thinking too much eh
cause like I mean it's a zoo what dorang confirm jaga punya
oh my god I nak pergi

I makan chocolate lah makan apa lah
eh you know kalau you tengok like advertisement everything right they always have like
uh toothpaste right like banyak gila right actually by right it's too much seh actually it's just supposed to be like macam one thin layer on your toothbrush and that is enough
then macam
tak lah tu group member lain lah you tak dengar betul eh

marah pe
is it ada jual dekat your house area
oh cause bilik spare
pasal okay
recently dia buat dia
he did this one thing ah dia
okay and then afterwards yup ya tu the the other time different something that was something shadier ah
what he did was he like borrowed money from kawan aku cakap kawan aku lah ah this one guy
I mean I think you can guess lah who what what this entity is lah rather than who abeh
abeh lepastu then
kawan aku texted me
ah my our mutual friend dia cakap
eh apasal ada orang text aku
ni cakap owe money pay money rumah tenet nya
abeh like with pictures of his house and everything
in a bit I thought he was kidding ah cause aku saw the pictures eh ni legit sia
so I call him ah called my aku called tenet aku cakap dengan tenet eh
kau tahu apa-apa tak pasal ni please reply ah
abeh dia cakap oh tak tak ni semua tak tahu ni dah lama dah dah<malay>lama aku hutang abeh aku tak kasi nombor wafan which is our friend ah
aku tak kasi nombor wafan abeh I don't know how they got wafan number
abeh aku macam okay ah initially aku percaya dia ah then afterwards aku talk to my friend on the phone ah yang kena
eh afan kau ingat tak that time there's this one time ada orang tiba-tiba call kau cakap they are from
ah clarifying you abeh cakap ah do you know tenet
kata ya ya it's not my brother but that one my friend
macam okay ah
abeh lepastu ah ah then after we came to the conclusion that tu yang
that entity he borrowed the money from ah standard lah nak verify
you just anyhow give random person's number ke tak kan ya
so that afterwards aku macam oh
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend ni that he didn't know that dia would be part of this ah macam
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage pe semalam
abeh macam we were just
abeh terus when I call him about it aku cakap kau tell me honestly ah kau cakap kau tak kasi number then afterwards I ask him
yang that time this one
shady number called my friend tu betul tak
what you claim it was ke ini
abeh dia cakap ah actually betul lah gitu then asal kau tipu
kau tell us lah when you already in this shit
kau tell us properly ah abeh macam terus sorry sorry kata dah clear
aku dah macam dah haiya
oh tu aku tak aku tak sure ah but he can go there ah
so ya aku abeh lepastu then yesterday eh this morning ke yesterday he said
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month aku dah macam
cause any harm to me or my family yet apa so I don't think it's fair
so aku cakap it's okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa ah
ya by october that was the initial agreement abeh lepastu dia cakap eh yang dia nak extend until first december aku okay
then afterwards she said dia nak tukar until
eh no ya five ke march I can't remember
ya aku okay ah cause he's been a good
so far tapi then
one thing on top of another lah that happen to him abeh then aku keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
abeh well
what macam very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term nya thinking
you know you know those kind of people apa
snowball anjing
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah lah
end of next month dah okay
abeh like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks macam ye lah paiseh ah
if he knew about shade kau asal buat ni semua kan
ya he should have been tapi
that's the thing lah that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam eh ah nak pinjam duit
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant ah without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do kan
abeh kawan aku tu gi geylang dengan dia cakap macam
not really doesn't have a place macam I dare not kind of thing macam kau lah basically
aku didn't really bitch at him about it lah aku tak macam bising ke apa lah aku tak
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront aku I I said
I'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry lah cause I was not in the receiving end of this ah so it's fine lah
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then I found out aku pun pissed ah I told you already not to do that anymore
macam it's addictive what
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
am thinking lah what to do now abeh ada other ah ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu lah he's going to pay back I hope lah eventually
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
from what aku understand ah my wife said the same thing you get me
farid cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
I mean okay lah it's true ah macam you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
ah aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress ah now they divorced kan
aku every time
aku do feel
what I shouldn't be there okay lah kim said it perfectly ah cakap
I don't want to validate this relationship tapi I don't want to say macam eh you cannot hang out with us ah
macam I want to hang out with him
but then eventually what I did was aku just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
lupa ah good names
twenty twelve I think ah aku don't really remember exactly
tapi eh eh anal lah then okay anyways stress ah aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
cakap please boleh astagfirullahaladzim
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku fahim and
lupa ah good names okay whatever lah bukannya ah okay anyway aku fahim and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
tapi this one whole group
tak usually we will know though
I mean initially my wife was worried lah dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
to be fair kan aku only met his now ex wife lah very very few times I think
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
you know they don't have eh eh concrete plan to do whatever lah cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both lah
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating ah this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background ah more than anything lah of course lah that plays a huge part
tapi okay ah to be fair
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not lah I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
she aku tak tahu eh fahim ah probably it is ah maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree lah I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu ah
no some apa no no surprise lah where you came from like which country you came from
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
aku believe kan the country could do much better if the royal family
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on ah
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
other things ah macam wan ah
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing lah the other one is
lama sia
kau okay you you talk to the guy before kan
aku tak tahu lah abeh oh anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please lah get on to your next point lah
ah aku tak tahu eh
tak tahu ah
ah aku find that
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial lah eh he said this one line ah aku macam palm his face ah he said you know initially I thought
aku dah macam eh kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me lah sia
aku dah macam eh kau please please please don't give me a
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see lah for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course lah no one listens to my advice pe aku kan just an apa
which which she should have done from the start ah aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also I don't know
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying oh my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much macam you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her lah
macam aku don't agree with the mentality ah ada orang cakap oh tak lah ni semua kerja perempuan macam eh
ah ni ni untuk kau
tak you know some people would step up ah dorang macam believe that they are better at it
yes I do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron
it's good to have one kau at least buy a steamer ah
masai sia tak iron
um so aku
you know lose not losing weight apa
he said he was at her play ah their place ah her place there there so long if he was their place he and din this mat salleh melayu aku very confused
his balding tak penting ah but
both of them went over to fahim place abeh ah ruqayyah was asleep
macam aku gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain lah cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared sia to the point where aku realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it lah I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
ya lah I I know lah but macam you can tell what there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
I really gain like twenty kilo sia macam you can tell lah pe the difference
I think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then I aku started losing weight
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what I eat more of
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang ah aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar pe
ah minang then at night aku makan cereal
aku started at sixty six
tak not there's some most nya chart would say aku average ah
oh local nya eh
yup you have a point ah pasal the whole ya shouldn't have
I should look into the maybe atau kalau malaysia nya pun boleh pakai lah
aku tengok benda-benda bodoh macam dia cakap nanti ah
aku tak tahu ah
kau lain ah
ya takleh cakap sekarang
then they took a took a picture lepastu aku perasan macam
eh aku dah gemuk gila ke apa
then I macam
ya I show you before ya which which is good lah then I was not expecting that turn ah which really changed everything ah aku stop drinking sweet things exclusively I used to drink flavoured drinks exclusively and I stop
there's a while aku really crave teh then aku macam okay lah we go buy teh then I think so okay ah
not so lah couldn't not really heavily addicted to food kau tahu macam people some eat a lot of gluttony gonna shit I don't lah
german nya the vacuum guy
I think so but I forgot or you never did I am not sure apa dia apa dia buat
sardin pe
like some people tak change their passport semua they just
change for the heck of it macam kau tahu you get the conversion card kan
macam grudgingly ah
oh as in the whole ah like handling the zakat
oh ya ya ya tu aku agree ah I have to agree with that correct
so ni semua subjective pe
siapa they both
your dad ke your mum
who she she tak
is it one of those macam trial lessons
no some people think of it that way macam are you sure you want to stoop this low and want to marry asian some people which fucked up lah but then some people really think of it that way I can do it
ah so aku tak tahu ah macam maybe just tell her that
tapi if I know switzerland is doing ke australia forgot like german speaking country it's not

gosok gigi ah please you know like last time like I kerja my supervisor
dia macam jenis yang macam oral hygiene like she don't care it's a she by the way she don't care dia macam ada tahi tahi
exactly exactly so macam kalau personally
it's okay tau macam normal lah you terselit spinach kan
ah leh macam tahi gigi on the surface macam from biofilm
and then when she drink coffee so she drink right and then the coffee stuck at the tahi gigi and then she will talk she will talk and talk and sometimes like was it serious
anyways it's like so macam mana she just talk to me
macam apa eh
itu because kaira focus gila because of her teeth oh my god macam habis kadang-kadang I think kawan kakak and then my friend my colleague also understand so she also want to laugh
asal dia gari emas eh
oh my god kakak tahu macam pakai yang macam itu rasa macam rimas gila eh like there's something on my finger
I don't know I think after a while you get used to especially kan the fake punya stuff
eh tapi cantik I think it's fine ah macam in life you have to experience all these
but it's fine kakak punya tan line masa tu dah lama I think dalam masa dua bulan tan line tu hilang and then like it starts again because that
I was having my menses second day so I morning tu bila ibu tiba-tiba message tau

then after that actually actually was abang lukman wanted to go to puncak to eat and then he actually told me kita cycle lah but then I say you gila ke because my bicycle is like macam
half can make it half cannot because that time ah we cycle all over and then my bicycle chain just terkeluar
then I panic ah then oh oh my god okay nasib baik abang lukman ada ah
then hari tu that day she suddenly ibu dekat luar pintu then like then after that thank god I baru habis mandi tau so I just open door
then it ibu dan ayah masuk ah and then ibu layan ayah to go for cycling then because ibu and ayah they are waiting then abang lukman just
then just say abang dengan ayah dekat luar kita pergi cycle lah tak baik macam cause we bunga ayah that time jauh pe naik

it's like those like macam perfect macam mancung habis kat sini macam ada sikit habis macam lawa for an
ah for an asian guy so and then because I also ibu also always like you know ibu hidung mancung ah cause atuk is like indian or whatsoever
ah ya whatever so ibu got that hidung mancung mah
then ibu always say hidung hidung penyek cause follow ayah mah so serious I always like picit my hidung cause I want
um hidung mancung then after that I always thought my hidung was big
macam I don't know like macam because like orang keep on saying macam ibu keep on saying hidung besar hidung besar so
so ya lah you tahu when hidung bawang macam bawang bawang gila
bawang ah ya
macam nek onah eh bukan eh nenek
ah ya atuk jer macam handsome kan
I mean uncle zair tak tahu kalau handsome time muda
ah macam okay macam kak mira dengan amsyar
dekat nur and eh ah nur and
so then after that I tak nanti I think I met abang lukman abang lukman say I got small nose
like one of the small nose and like quite mancung for a malay lah then I was like oh I didn't know that
ya but it's still considered small tengok macam tak
apa mermaid man
but then it's like kecil then oh it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
oh it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I gemuk
exactly because ayah ayah keep on saying uh
uh gemuk gemuk jangan makan nanti gemuk faham tak so it's like macam daripada kecil you have that body yang gemuk but then padahal you tak cukup makan
ya it's not the normal beras apa
and then aku tak tahu sekarang tapi
tapi macam kakak rasa sekarang kadang-kadang macam I can do it
then bila I stayed at his parents I timbang I was forty nine
lepas tu it was just like
then I I don't know how if I have fluctuate cause kat sana makanan banyak sekarang di sini kita makanan independent so macam
on let's say makan macam sikit sikit kurang sikit
mm kat dekat rumah serangoon last time banyak gila makanan
maybe like don't have plan but maybe dia mak and ayah use car
tak happy eh tapi kan ada minimum
tapi yes mah eh bapa dia nampak demam sikit
masa tu habis masa dah tak ada so semua ni lepas tu tukar jadi babat
habis that day I I took photo and then I send to his ayah lah then I cakap makin tembam budak ni
a'ah habis apa ayam ayam ayam everything ayam kalau tak ada ayam daging
mesti pun hantu ayam because kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit so macam bazir so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
sahaja luckily your face don't turn into chicken
um habis but then you skin will be saggy
kentang chicken
ya aiya kau ni mahal mahal juga aiya tak tahu nenek cakap satu meal berapa tau beberapa keping ayam
adik tahu satu packet um ayam satu packet ayam berapa satu packet ayam dua paling murah is seven dollar forty five cent
dia lepas tu tanya dia berapa banyak berapa banyak pieces tu ah boleh dapat thirty six
ah separated kalau is thirty six wings chicken drumsticks dengan wing atau lapan belas set of drumstick that is how much tau
itu kalau one week adik makan six kan adik boleh tahan selama three
tapi still mahal you tahu semalam yang kan tangan dimakan tu kau tahu itu berapa
ah sebab bersih sangat mampus kan
I thing is ah I think ah ayah dan ibu even the chicken I mean ah sorry it's not that nice
macam what is the flavour
no she's good at cooking but she like masak but she don't like to taste her food
ah is abang home already
sebab because living room itu baru if you make dekat tu also so it's nicer for him whereas the bilik kan macam dah tunggang pecah if you understand
in the point of macam healing kan it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than macam old you understand
kena buat partition lah ayah kena panggil buat partition
buat lah partition
that house that house is so big it has so many potential tapi macam
ah recognise or macam ayah eh ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk renovate and then ibu pula malas nak maintain so macam oh my god
macam they they put the effort to
cause ayah will start something and then he he will expect ibu to follow up with it
macam dah lapuk is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
why so degil one ah
ya can you imagine kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu nah
kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam japanese style
ah ya ya ya macam lawa macam just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice eh macam those
oh is it but you baring if you put your
tilam only if you put your tilam ah
the bawah is literally err
err apa ni like err literally like that tapi tak rasa
you don't feel it ah the only thing bad about that thing right they literally macam blew the papan onto the floor
so kalau macam in the future kalau nak macam shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially macam dia orang
macam kecil macam dia orang punya design of barang macam macam kecil and it's so efficient in my opinion
so kakak cakap suka gila that time when we went to
kyoto ah then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture kedai perabot
I think they literally jual macam one set macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya
cabinet atas dengan cabinet bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala lah dia punya there is literally one unit
and boleh masuk bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet ah macam bodoh sia
why can't they put the jamban and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
jamban just put together right oh my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so bodoh like even the tingkap this one ah
ni kan kalau rumah lama is dekat atas pe
this like for example kalau macam hujan but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows mah then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below air hujan masuk it's like so bodoh I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
tapi ini macam bodoh macam bodoh gila
rumah juan yang dekat uh uh huh
macam lawa macam it looks like a bedroom macam ni it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the jemuran eh
they don't even know what is inside the kotak right
ah ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture macam tu if ikea stuff don't buy on the kedai itself pergi carousell
jual and then jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa seh dining table dua puluh aku beli dua ratus
so macam geram gila macam ini set alarm right um we bought this two hundred and forty
ah macam banyak
ya kau macam eh sakitnya hati ya allah ya
so macam tak perlu seh I mean like the thing macam almari ni seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
brand new lagi just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
itunya macam menyesal so kadang-kadang kan just buy from carousell
I mean yang paling biasa I carousell kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan free items eh
apa add on
tak free stuff macam orang kasih free orang nak macam just siapa-siapa nak ambil free ah macam give away
what tu apa
call of duty ini pasal apa eh

yes and then kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan kan
ya different dia tak ada then three years her course was just three years
so dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana
india pun ada north india
tak nak malas because very expensive what
uh that one aku dah check semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil
and then bawah itu ada spain I think semua
so pergi or I or I pergi
ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the
ah apa nama tu
it's like a feature wall belakang katil
satu nak macam like that
then depan dia you want to put your projector or what then it's up to you lah
nak frame apa
might as well paint sendiri kan terus tampal amacam
I don't want to put something like you know macam frame
kena kat kepala tengah tidur sakit sial
confirm sakit
confirm sakit
I thought you want to tear down the wall and then taruk dining room
eh dining room pula dining table
entrance tu kan nak buat ah ni
nak buat banyak raised floor
it does so that macam if let's say orang datang
orang duduk kat atas raised floor tu kan macam lepak ke baring-baring ke
a'ah eh orang daripada luar boleh nampak eh
mmhmm nanti jadi
kaum puak eh
nak buat raised floor tak dekat sebelah tingkap
on anzari had ada ah
okay how about that room the first bedroom tu
kita buat yes kita buat raised floor
and then kita
buat bilik tu macam our workstation
ya it's like macam
it's it's a macam mana nak cakap eh
okay dia
raised floor dia sampai dekat tingkap tu so that kita boleh baca kat atas tu kita boleh duduk kat atas tu kita boleh lepak
where you can even baring lah senang cakap boleh boleh tidur lah kat situ
and then dia tak tinggi sangat dia tak rendah sangat
correct so if you can either duduk or you can even baring
but it's near the tingkap lah then bawah tu can put books or maybe kita boleh taruk maybe some
apa drawer or something like that
okay remember bilik tu ada ada almari
yang almari yang built-in
pecah kan
we we make a table macam yang
ah or either way lah mana mana nya side lah so that is where our
ah apa nama dia
laptop and our workstation ah senang cakap
then at the side maybe we just pasang satu
ah satu apa nama dia
satu swing yang mount dekat daripada ceiling
we don't mount dekat ceiling lah then we buy the the one that with stand
we get the swing yang you know yang facing each other punya
you know the one yang kita lepak dekat
nanti swing tu goyang sendiri
tutup lah pintu jangan masuk masa I tak ada
no lah I mean the swing yang satu tapi the stand okay pe
if we are going to workout kat rumah
okay then maybe okay then maybe satu
ah for us to run ke apa ke
if I want to go for weights then I go to the gym yang dekat tu
alah then tak ada swing
tak lah swing tu tak bergerak sendiri lah
atau swing taruk dekat living room ah living room lagi nampak
the yang
mount nak kena pay extra eh
mount cuba kalau because if we mount kita tak boleh alih-alih kan
why do I want to alih-alih kan
if let's say ya macam like macam kat rumah awak
kan macam mak
from this side then dia nak change to the other side
ah lepastu ni sekarang dia nak change to this side balik
ah macam dia boleh change tapi kalau dah mount
dah tak boleh tukar dah tak boleh ubah
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down mana nak taruk tu
boleh memang betul but then
dekat wall the other side is not
wooden wall faham tak
dia boleh alih even with the console dia boleh alih
okay kalau kita ada console
we can move it to the window macam my house
ya okay pasal my house dia tak mount kan then on on top the console pe
ah so dia boleh alih-alih
so from there dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat wall atau dia boleh dekat this wall
so you can you can actually macam if let's say this year you nak macam gini then next year you nak macam gini
ah tukar mood you know tukar tukar tempat ke
it it might you know we don't know which which one yang
kena dengan kita pe
no lights can just tampal belakang jer
so the light shine dekat tembok
so it it if kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang lah dia tak shine
dia boleh shine boleh boleh shine tapi tak nampak sangat ah
but if you put on the wall kalau ah facing the wall
then the the light will show apa
will memacarkan
dekat wall
of course lah tak lah
tu dah colour colour
no okay macam let's say sini
putih eh
then sini macam grey
and then sini putih sini grey
so that it will look macam apa tau how to say eh
because your okay because you said you don't want the colour to lari jauh pe it's medium grey and light grey
so okay if you even if you put it together macam gini dua dua and then in the middle you taruk
you campur dua dua
and then you go and paste ah macam
mm mm ya ya tapi satu tub one whole big tub tu tak cukup satu rumah
kalau one whole house is about two
yang besar yang as in tub besar gitu tau
ah yang the one yang sikit hari ayah bawa balik ah yes correct that one two
kalau for the whole house
it depends on the colour juga
so yang chalk nya is like macam
susah nak hilang ah
oh macam macam you know the pagar yang colour hijau tu
pakai chalk sudah normal one
dia jatuh takut belakang tali dia pasang tali tali putus jatuh kat kepala kita sakit kan
might as well just tampal
tampal tak okay tampal dia boleh cabut
so in a dia tak stay permanently
I thought living room you don't want to put ayat-ayat
eh kentalnya tak nak ah
frame is so old school seh tak nak ah don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want
but if you put frame dah macam rumah pakcik makcik
tu jer I can say it looks modern but if you put it in a frame it looks old school
faham tak then that is a different story
okay then kat bilik ah
see kat bilik pun tak nak
so nak kena ada pergi balik
okay is it ayat as in ayat from the al-quran or ayat is just macam words of wisdom
since awak tak nak nampak sangat eyesore sangat kan why not put it in the dining room
where got tembok
masuk rumah is just tembok kecil sikit jer
ah tembok kecil sikt lepastu dah pagar pagar pagar pe
tembok tu I think I want to macam panjang kan sikit ah
then the yang yang satu satu satu tu nak buang
but then kita tak ada if like that then kita tak ada store
I know so I thought if let's say kita dah masuk then we make that store we make it as a store
and then our dining room kita kecil kan sikit ah sebab meja besar gila ah meja dia boleh duduk berapa enam tujuh lapan sepuluh orang boleh duduk
I don't know whether we still need store room tak because barang-barang besar kotak-kotak apa ke nak simpan
kita beli vacuum like vacuum punya kotak you know that kind of thing
then kotak-kotak tu nak simpan
okay so we kita akan kecil kan that dining room
so that masuk boleh jalan kat dalam
atau sini taruk barang aje then sini boleh jalan
nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu ah I mean I think by next year I think next year kita dah boleh buat ah
bomb shelter is semua rumah baru
kita nya bomb shelter is kat bawah blok
bomb shelter kat bawah
yang tempat budak-budak ah sekolah tu nursery ah that one is bomb shelter
ada uh I think kat bawah
mm tapi dia buat macam
I don't know lah but I don't think ada orang occupy that room
ah flat yang ada bomb shelter
ya because my flat ni ada bomb shelter untuk orang-orang yang macam macam daripada blok sebelah
blok sebelah ah nak lari
second room is macam taruk
maybe kita cantik kan sikit ke atau do some cleaning on it
so we just I think just guest room atau tempat orang nak solat ah dah
if let's say orang nak solat ah
even kalau dekat dalam study room tu orang nak solat pun boleh
kecil ah
but okay lah should be okay lah macam bilik amni
mm bilik amni is like that
ya kita nak taruk dia kat situ is katil yang
for now maybe my single bed ah single bed taruk sana dulu
because kalau
satu orang jer boleh tidur
tak kan satu nak tidur bawah satu tidur atas kan
takpe lah just
apa nama dia mm
katil queen-sized
just masukkan satu katil queen-sized
tapi nak kena swee swee kira menghadap
gitu lah so ada space a lot more space
so can solat down there
eh awak punya handphone macam jauh jer
tak tahu dengar ke tak lah but
because down there dorang dah buat
uh apa nama dia
dah buat almari kat situ
okay the the almari is L shaped
ah camne nak cakap eh it's like macam okay ni tiga room
letak sini dua then satu dua tiga
ah faham tak
rather than I have that might as well ada one two three
then one two three then in the middle put cermin
that place kita buat walk-in wardrobe
that short yang dia cakap yang the one that you say is short walkway tu kan
ah that one kita buat walk-in wardrobe ah instead of dia buat macam gitu L shaped
we tambah lagi satu gini tapi yang tu yang dalam tu the one inside
kita pecah kan
three macam gini
ah this like this wardrobe but three macam gini ah ni this is three
tak tak tak this dua pintu is three inside
then kat bawah sini ada
ah laci correct ah that one is one two three
then in the middle I want to put macam baju gantung untuk kat atas tu gantung panjang
from here to here sampai hujung
gantung tapi in the middle I want to put macam satu drawer
apa nama dia ah macam taruk jam jam ke
ah jam jam ke ah your accessories ke
can see through apa nama dia panggil tu
cermin eh not cermin
kat situ ah
because it's two faham tak it's two
so tempat siap is tengah tengah sini and then depan sini is ah
apa yang got space to walk of course lah got space to walk
got space to walk maksudnya
unless I want to take my baju lah
tak kan tak boleh tepi sikit tepi sikit
tak kan tak boleh
tepi sikit no
so kalau gini jalan senget
boleh pe
so the cermin okay the the ya is like this cermin
exactly beside that macam table macam gini tapi rendah sikit with a cermin
if you don't want cermin also can
then just satu table jer lah kat situ
satu table macam gini ah
like this kind ah like macam this this kind of laci ah
corner seat okay juga
then bawah ni semua is not our stuff
boleh juga up to you
can this one you want to take out pun boleh pecah kan taruk yang glass
but then not nice lah kan dalam kalau berselerak abeh orang macam mm
definitely berselerak
then the katil
my side dekat dengan tingkap
or you want to dekat dengan tingkap which one
then my side of the bed ada satu meja kecil jer bukan meja macam gini
dia meja kecil jer
bed side table pun boleh lah
mm then in sorang is a
ah apa taruk projector kan
kat mana nak taruk projector tu
tak ya your projector will project the image on the wall but where do you want to put the projector
you want to gantung dekat ceiling
or you want to gantung dekat atas katil
no lah I mean buat satu macam
not rak ah ya maybe rak
buat satu macam rak gitu then taruk kat situ
somewhere around here pun
waste of space might as well you just tampal tampal tampal everything on your
murah punya ah
if five room berapa how much harga dia
if four room berapa harga dia
tapi dia cakap five room
not my pasal what
correct what not my pasal what
tak tahu pula eh
if malaysia boleh
we also boleh mah
mm tak ada apa
check lah we check like macam bawah bowl ke bowl seat bowl tu ke apa ke
tak lah I think the sanitisation tak include cleaning ke
ah apa nama dia they will have a
jet no they don't need the jet spray you nak
dia nak scrub apa lantai
ye they have that they have that apa nama dia
I nak minum hot chocolate dulu
okay so kita memang dah tak
meat products as much as we did before I mean dua ribu dua belas eh dua ribu dua puluh dah kind of okay
so how how far lang nak go in to into veganism
I rasa
tapi in a way I think we're almost
I rasa
tapi I rasa I macam ada
selfishness sebab I don't
feel the same thing bila macam guna ikan bilis just because they are smaller than a chicken or lembu
ah I rasa selfish sebab they should be equal
ya ya ya faham mukbang
a'ah in a way lah sebab
I mean orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing is our companion pet banyak orang guna sebagai ah ada anjing as pet
manja lah binatang tu can be so is that the same comparison
tapi kita start dengan err hunting and gathering food from ah natural resource macam
dia pergi memburu semua kan then baru come this era bila orang start berkebun and jumpa teknik berkebun
wah I tak ingat
jadi kalau you nak go into veganism you akan
be a vegan lah bukan vegetarian
telur I cannot leave that I mean I
I boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu but I feel like I need my protein daripada telur
tapi the challenge
ah you I tak sure tapi I
the challenge will come bila balik rumah mama
masak apa yang dia masak lah I don't think I have the strength to tolak
because it's not something yang I boleh dapat every day
I I can do that kalau pergi kedai kawan
tapi kalau balik rumah family dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan
but I myself don't have the strength to tolak apa yang dah ada tu ah
ah and sebab I tahu
so susah ah
you macam mana
apa yang spark your idea untuk
err timeline ke
yang membuat you sampai ke part yang mana you nak jadi vegan ni ada cerita dia ke
macam cringe cringey
I rasa
yang betul-betul macam the moment yang spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
and because of a lot of things eh yang you bagi tau I lah and dia macam I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan kan sebab we have abundant soy sauce we have that err we have abundant soy derived products macam tempeh tauhu
mm sedap jer
ya lah sebab kita crave
spread penyakit ke macam nyamuk you you never know which one yang gigit you yang bawa aedes
extreme lah I mean I I think dua hari lepas kot I kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi
selain delving into veganism apa you punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu
kalau ada lah
I think ada kot
I rasa I rasa I punya azam tahun ni I nak
sebab I dah lama sangat tinggalkan drawing and sekarang I rasa janggal nak buat the kind of drawing yang I pernah buat dulu
janggal gila sampai sampai macam halfway tu dah menyampah tau
tapi tapi I I tau lah kalau kalau practise every day
dia makin lama makin okay so that's one of my
lepas tu I nak
belajar italian
and probably greek as well sebab tu pun dah tinggal quite lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu
um apa lagi eh
I wish I can say yang I nak seriously
belajar music but
but quit susah lah sebab I I don't have the same passion untuk tahu what's behind the system
ah dia not not as fulfilling but
atau maybe about
nak cakap lack of audience pun tak juga ah
even dekat rumah pun
dia macam not as motivated lah untuk untuk pegang musical instruments
just in case tapi kalau dah beli then tak main
apa ah my other resolution
sebab ah before this kita depend on performance and
if we have side jobs yang
then tu macam bonus but by by the end of last year dia dah turn to the other way round
memang ah memang more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way lah because I tak selesa pun untuk keluar and perform and jumpa orang in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still nak ada event takut juga ah
kalau you punya new year resolution apa yang dah boleh tiru dah I punya
berasa macam I nak belajar japanese sebab I tengok food wars tu tapi
better untuk focus dekat
tu lah
tapi so far italian is not that hard I rasa I boleh catch up balik
ah and I suka sebab macam once you belajar italian you can kind of faham french as well dia ada kaitan ah dia dia ada kaitan
quite beneficial untuk learn that one language
sebab dia boleh branch out to bahasa-bahasa lain selain language to apa lagi you punya ni you punya azam
uh I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore cakap the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself dia dah ada everything yang dia nak
I rasa it's not
and then ending pun
you you you you decide the topic pula
apa yang akan jadi in two thousand twenty one ah
I rasa akan ada
for sure sebab in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
ah dia punya
macam musicians tak dapat buat shows
ah ya artist tak boleh buat exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start macam
to make everything better for myself lah sebenarnya especially if that's their only creative outlet
dia redundant it's very redundant
but what about live shows I think um live shows pun dah start ada search juga because um sebanyak yang start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations memang
social distancing code scanning and everything so itu pun I rasa in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
I baca dekat twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
dia orang cakap your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
macam flu or fever side effect yang teruk-teruk
so I think I pun tak walaupun I takut jarum but I don't think I akan stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
ya lah faham
I mean even sekarang masa pandemic pun I dah tak ingat what happened in june in may
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic ni akan berlangsung lama and they cannot depend on skill yang dia orang dah ada so they have to broaden their horizon
okay can you explain pasal stoicism sebab I try baca tapi I macam
apa you punya philosophy philosophical standpoint
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you memang dah
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding tak sama so
once the border buka
scandinavian countries dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama european
bukan yang yang yang tak payah stamp passport tu ah dia tak termasuk dalam schengen countries eh oh termasuk oh then why
tapi I memang curious on how they can manage to provide
what about southeast asia or asia lah in general ada tak yang you nak pergi
ke kita memang western centric
I think sebab I think the the the reason is because
um dia orang preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit macam dekat sini most of them are
tapi asia I
nak pergi tak I nak pergi indonesia but but but the parts yang kita tak pergi before ah
I think tu pun interesting and for some reason
I nak pergi thailand sangat sangat sebab I rasa macam I nak dia punya street food
tu jer kot as for now
ah india but maybe bila umur dah lima puluh nanti lah boulogne and lah
mm selain tu
eh tapi yang tesla buat
the space flight yang you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
kan they dia buat dia buat this err flight flight system baru yang mana you can travel across the world in less than three hours ke two hours a'ah
so I don't know if that is still running sebab dia nak
benda tu affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years ke
balik hari jer pun boleh
I suka that documentary
centric tapi understandable lah sebab creator dia pun from
wah I punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam what do you want
you dah cakap you stoic so I dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu
apa yang you nak change
mm I faham
tapi tu lah I think I learn more
ah dekat dekat internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually kat okay I mean form five pun I don't have
and I tak pakai
hujung form five I pakai iphone but before that I pakai
ada laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use ah but I
I lebih I I understand bila ayah yang ajar
kena ambil to TOEFL lah lagi sekali
tapi tu lah dia punya price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so dia expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until dia expire macam the last time I ambil rugi jer
then sia-sia even if you dapat offer travel while once you nak masuk dia akan minta balik your TOEFL punya sijil then you have to take again
two thousand twenty one ni
kira start of the decade kan
bukan yang two thousand twenty kan last year was the ending
a'ah kita tunggu the fireworks
kita tunggu the fireworks but nothing happen
I pun takde expectation
that that one quite fast tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah
I harap
entah lah I don't have any
poll sekarang
like dia macam
tak dia from semua benda sebab
I tak rasa
macam you tadi cakap lah ah
afterlife punya benda kita tak tahu and it's not within our control kan dan ni pun sama it's not within my control so whatever happens happens lah
apa pun yang dia orang buat I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
tu jer
entah lah
tapi I I'm quite positive about
tak hopeless sangat
it's been awhile since I rasa hopeless dengan
the whole tahun
oh kaum is a very sensitive issue
and I tak suka tengok Facebook comment
dia almost macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu you don't have any feelings at all
ah bangsa malas membaca
lepas tu tajuk everything click bait
ah I wish that kena change
yang tu kena change
but journalism yang spark head
orang yang malas membaca tu ya malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun they have to click in order to know the
ni nurse yang nurse yang yang ni infected tu dekat yang vaksin mm mm
and then kismis dan
mm tapi yang news pasal nurse tu very misleading sebab even if you take your first vaccine untuk dia sampai ke fifty percent immunity tu dia ambil dua minggu
dia kena COVID within I think hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu it's not even two full weeks yet and even kalau dah two full weeks pun not a full total immunity
second shot baru ni tapi
and lagi pun journalisms sekarang mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then jadi satu bentuk berita ah yang penting ada content ya monetisation and yang penting duit jalan K
tapi content memang tak best langsung especially because the audience dalam Twitter and dalam Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
oh dah ni
lagi satu minit there's only one minute left
ah nanti kan bila you dah settle you click right ah tick ah
okay lah macam tak rasa sangat can speak one hour macam tak
penat entah macam okay one of the reason eh sebab secondary school dengan primary school dah habis sekolah tau so macam ah dah nak masuk holiday mindset aku dah macam ah nak holiday nak holiday nak holiday abeh tapi poly masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja ah lagipun during this period ah the exams are like
nak kena apa jaga safe distancing kan so like the exams are out so most of our
so macam and most of the time kan my graded assignment semua kena buat report and for report confirm nak kena buat research banyak
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a banyak benda ah so
macam by the time dah habis sekolah macam ah dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat and nak balik rumah one hour journey macam just the thought about it dah buat aku penat and when I came home
I submit lah but it was like ah macam
half half macam macam fifty percent punya reflection journal a'ah ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya itu jer abeh like
like you saw ah macam I just macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis oi
eh but your poly days macam lagi rabak because
like creativity like err macam ah
no because three point one is more of macam internship tau and these tuesday ada briefing on the internship ah and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it macam I don't know because macam okay macam I don't know eh because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced kau macam put it in a beautiful way
tapi tapi just the thought of um having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean err ya it was at home so like but quite like mendak macam like err no err so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that yang assigned dia through
I don't know lah dia tak elaborate ah but but yeah it was mostly a research
dia datang for like one two days first two days leh then the period starts
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first kan orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like macam familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building tapi for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
macam gitu ah so like and kan dorang like most of my kawan yang year ones
dorang like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the ah school punya website
so macam
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right kan so macam dorang macam
how am I supposed to berbual with this person gitu ah
no lah I berbual english because by the time right for my batch dah banyak ada yang ambil tamil gini semua
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret masuk poly ya but
but I didn't regret masuk poly because like because certain things macam how
okay so aku macam old schools sikit computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how kental I am
ya so diam so ah so bila masuk poly tiba-tiba dah kena buat ah share document and all that then I was like apa ni apa ni I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like macam
like I don't know I don't know ah macam if I think that macam eh
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like huh apa ni like what am I supposed to do there ah so macam
no wonder kau selalu pergi library I thought it was to like to baca buku no
since I'm already eighteen right so macam some some things that actually almost all of the things kan kau kat aku
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so macam I tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things daripada mami dan abi macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda everything first hand aku selalu dapat second or third hand aku macam I was kind of jealous at that point of time tapi that
macam dengar like what's like actually what happened actually so macam okay lah not deserved lah macam
not deserve lah macam okay lah deserve lah sikit deserve lah
macam messenger facebook
oh secondary three secondary four okay so macam
okay firstly kan since ah okay so the teachers pun macam tahu ah like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates semua macam ah heck care macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni just it was that bad uh like even like teacher pun macam what
tapi for me right
why not have fun macam macam this is the last few days sebelum like macam like some macam ya macam ya
a good memory lah so like our class macam quite
rabak ah to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like macam act serabak dorang lah like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
ah so macam
I had to do most of the things that macam
like attendance ah keep track of apa
dah hantar acknowledgement slip or whatsoever ah so and most of the time even the teachers know that ah
macam tanya monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one yang akan represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
it was that bad so macam all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students ah twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
tak ada satu pun ah terpaksa ah ah
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one lah the four years lah it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like kakak was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time err I don't know leh because ah tapi like they most of the teacher point out ah like I am so different from you and abang ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what macam ya no matter what ah
aku akan avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
B three I don't want to tell you tak payah ah so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us dah macam go through many things so like and sec three sec four ada macam project macam masa tu ada this international is a apa humanitarian job ah so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising lah so like almost like everyday kita orang stay back and macam pop up macam this one booth kita orang jual air jual roti jual pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates lah so macam and had a lot of fun lah then bila secondary four okay by the time secondary four semua orang dah tahu that is going to be the last year and this is the last time untuk macam rebel ah bukan rebel ah as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow ah macam and since kita orang dah tahu is our last year kan semua orang makin rapat
and then so macam
even when macam ah the teachers like complain about us and then our class macam ah it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
macam this class macam hais this class like ah ah
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us err pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy err male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like oh my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like err on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear punya height
eh tak actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder ah so macam everytime right I will like gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek then sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi so macam uh geram ah but this kind of memories like macam ah
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days macam it's just like
A B C D E F ah so macam but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class ah
but then like for the lower class right dorang like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing kesian juga macam like everyone akan tengok ya but then but the thing I hated the most because kita orang the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because kita orang macam macam ah okay ah tak payah apex camp no I am more of a person of yang tak suka interact bukan antisocial
cuma I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend ah ni
kau hold grudge eh
so means dorang stay back longer than kau stay back ah
oh then why didn't you like cakap to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six punya kerja
but did you realise everytime during camp or macam stay over kat sekolah kan
like most of us are macam tak tidur
oh korang tidur eh
oh no because for my batch right macam everytime kalau ada macam ada qiyam or macam macam sleep kat sekolah kan
selalu like malam kan kita orang tak tidur
kita orang kita orang uh tidur dekat level three the boys tidur dekat level one but then ah toa payoh
ah okay so ah so but then kita orang dekat level three kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual ah with the girls ah kita orang berbual ah macam gossip something like that
like dekat parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand kita orang macam curious ah like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning oh one lah
then kita orang semua gather abeh tengok like
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did ah but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like tak tidur so the rest kena punishment but then right I think the male teachers like macam
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep macam tak terganggu with any check
creepy keras
and it was all girls lah but dah tak ada lelaki so ah ah oh then suddenly like two of us macam nak beli makanan and because it was during lunchtime and dah penat ah so okay lah the so it was left with me and another one friend lah kat dalam
suddenly we heard the same thing you know the macam the drain ya
of the another car park yang sebelah Mendaki sense it was the other it was the other side so like there's no car
there should be no car beside us and is at the level one so macam eh
why would I know that's why kita orang dah macam curious then so like err okay actually me and my friend were like talking so macam we heard that sound then we were like
kita orang diam kita orang like give each other a look ah then like okay ah how about we just like macam macam
ah ah kita orang rasa macam how about we err we buy drinks from the vending machine then I was like so kita orang keluar a'ah
add up bila dekat luar baru kita orang macam did you hear that
but to be honest like the chalet or the like house right macam scary like the vibe
and it was like so far from the bus stop and the bus stop pun like quite sunyi
to be honest I've never encountered this type of situation and I don't want to encounter this type of situation ever because to be honest I'm quite a scary cat juga lah
no because because to be honest compared to the both of us kau lagi rabak so I had to be the one yang okay with it so macam ah I cannot
I think it was during the lunchtime lah so macam uh so some of us like went out to
mafia game eh no eh I don't know it was one of the games so we had macam macam ah
bukan application lah it was just a website kita orang ini so kita orang enter macam this group I'm in that kira macam game pin
then the masuk no no it was not telegram it was just a website ah so macam dah gitu so they will assign the mafia or the spy gitu so for that game we had to question each other lah like okay so ah what is this place this place have like
it was the Mendaki side punya Mendaki sense punya side and was the second level and the other corner bukan the corner to parade square the other corner nak masuk hall canteen
err how about we stop this this game because no one tau because we always like eh macam I point like someone else lah it was you then the other guy was no I thought it was you no I thought it was you so we were like who is this ah ah ya that's why we showed our phone lah macam no it's not us tak ada pun tak ada like kita orang tengok kat phone kan
eh all of us are like the macam workers staff at the place tak ada orang the spy
ah no the like no we macam they would like macam is there macam enough players kira macam this is like dah macam start the game so that only the players kira macam even we didn't like say the game pin out loud so macam none of us like
tak ada orang ah boleh suspect[oh no what happen oh because the day before kita orang tengok
during the stay back punya time ah mengundang
because I don't know because like it was like with the class kan so macam the scary movie macam the horror movie macam tak affect tak affect langsung ah
but then the next day it happens so kita orang macam ya
because they have to tap to masuk right
uh like apa with
kunci or was it a lock or oh pin okay
this dengan siapa
okay cakap pasal horror stories right
okay one of my friend have sixth sense dia boleh
like dia boleh nampak a few things like things that you cannot kita orang tak boleh nampak ah
so there was this one time kat dalam class
but then I just sat beside her except because kawan rapat kan no it was in primary school it was ah level eight so the teacher was like teaching okay lah macam biasa
then suddenly my kawan macam eh why is this guy standing outside from just now then I was like
pusing ah pusing tengok then I was like there's no guy there's no one
then I was like because um I'm quite macam rapat juga ah primary six and our class is at the eight level which is the highest level and
ya it's quite macam nanti ada connected to another building and that building quite
kosong there's no one it's empty ya so I was I was turning my head then I was like I saw no one then I was like I macam dah hyperventilate macam apa ini what is happening but um I quite rapat dengan dia so I know that she can see these things lah
again lah if he is he still standing there because mungkin it's just a person like just passing by or something lah going another class or just another parent ke tengah nak tunggu their child I don't know I just thinking a lot of possibilities situation ya then
not so clear like he's like just like macam bayang
and dia pakai baju black clothes clothing don't don't don't don't then okay okay then I ask my friend lah
like imagining stuff on like on my right side of the class so macam no I was supposed to be at end of the side because that was my friend kan so macam I wanted to sit beside her lah teman for that class for that lesson
tak akan nampak that thing macam I just don't want to see that thing macam tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh I don't want I don't want I don't want I just avoid looking at that
oh macam my humanity korang ah but then you don't

mm aku ingat macam the name is macam malay cultural group itu tapi dia have different macam cabang-cabang
so macam ideas mm
tapi aku ni dari yang islamic punya community
tapi tu best
macam dia orang masuk um buat amal ramadan
dia orang pack pack barang aku sangat suka tahu cakap tak tahu
okay nah aku macam
ajak a lot of macam fun
tapi macam aku nak banyak masuk tapi macam
macam commitment dia macam kau tahu tak aku punya course macam mana my course is a very
cause course aku is not an easy course
I I definitely say I could've mentally prepared to costly either that I might need to wake up two o'clock to do my journal to do my journalism punya apa topic
mass comm is like easy easy apa easy course untuk masuk
and dia punya content pun macam kau tengok lah if like mass comm
mm film some video dengan editing yang itu kan these are the courses yang macam indirect hiburan and at the same time dia orang macam ah burn the midnight oil lah gitu dia orang cakap
ada orang shooting sampai dua pagi
wah bayangkan
aku rasa aku ada week kalau macam tu aku chillax chillax
silakan farzana mahu tidur lah
tinggal berapa minit ni ya allah empat puluh tiga forty three more minutes
oh aku di intern kan aku rasa
I might go to macam music what's that call music punya
aku nak belajar overseas like aku nak belajar overseas aku nak belajar overseas sebab aku nak rasa ya
being independent ya because kalau kau belajar overseas kau takde you have no excuse to know not how to cook
you must know how to cook to survive because kalau kau cakap home mak aku masak aku tak nak masak
kalau kat luar I have to cook for myself
so at the same time kau belajar untuk berdikari do household rasa macam mak aku rasa
so aku macam nak experience that thing tapi macam kesian pun lah tinggal parents aku
mungkin sebab you have like sister that's why like you don't have sister will be their house buruk-buruk macam mana pun kakak kau akan tetap kat di situ tapi the fact aku ni kakak
aku macam aku rasa macam berat aje tinggalkan mak aku berat jer tinggal family aku
we should though macam
ah overseas ke
actually aku macam nak masuk malaysia tapi macam
daftar sekali korea takde korea uh
cuma feeling kita pergi australia australia kat aku rumah australia
like aku pernah pergi
sedih um
anak comfort like satu macam ni afini dah makan ke belum have you eaten lunch ke belum
nanti kalau puasa puasa tadi makan apa did you go to restaurant to makan macam itu
mm betul
mm yang tak salah aku cupcake aisyah
dia belajar dekat sana kan is it
dia ada dia punya own dorm
kita
dia ni lah ada satu member
satu macam ustazah itu kau jangan nak buat macam ini ya kalau kita dekat dia punya mother calling calling kau jangan nak buat any problem sia
aku nak sangat I'm only want the account macam paling kita tiga like the three of us
coal banyak masak you you will be the one jap afini masak
tak it's alright semua ni
like pernah nampak aku masak ke
aku tak pernah ke aku tak pernah masak untuk kau orang even not once at least iffa pernah masak kimchi
ya okay kerja rumah
kerja rumah haven't vacuum mop
um apa lagi vacuum mop lipat baju uh
um bersih bersih aku boleh
aku okay gosok baju
jemur-jemur kain pun aku okay
what kenapa kenapa why why
ya aku rasa kita yang lagi beberapa minute only
ya right mm nine more minutes lepas tu kita dye and dusted again lagu lah
lama seh kau nak buat berapa minutes lagi
like recording conversation I mean like for me personally kalau dua orang macam
lagi lagi iffa kau masukkan iffa dalam conversation ini it's gonna be like
I don't know how to describe lah kalau macam ni macam mana nak describe
um I think like kena satu ada satu topic untuk berbual
iffa iffa will always have that satu topic untuk ya converse within dua kita orang dua
aku anggap kita macam like more toward like bual-bual kosong
oh yang lelaki tu kan
eh they gave him macam
apa conditional a warning
aku rasa itu macam ada orang ought to see
like it's me kalau benda seorang yang benda sama ya
but macam kalau if you put it in term macam macam kita as a human punya equality
macam diri kita sendiri macam tak kisah orang tu race tu apa what is his race but logically like if you murder sama macam aku seorang you have
macam it's logic for someone to kena gantung ke
macam you murder someone
logically who kena gantung this is like um like the basic macam law that we know lah but
I don't know what derives dia punya court macam kasih conditional warning see the word conditional warning
a'ah so preposterous gila pergi beijing
I saw I go nampak yang punya news nanti
like they tweeted about the story pasal this thing ah
sekarang macam malaysia dah ada lot of cases like
a spike seh dia orang punya
like tiba-tiba kesian kesian lah
tak yang macam ada yang aku nampak tak pakai mask ada yang pakai so it's like aku rasa orang tu macam tak consistent lah
um itu cluster
ya betul betul wei ya dia ni macam pasal donald trump
dia punya anak punya anak kena COVID nineteen
anak donald trump kena COVID nineteen the fourteen years old punya yes
like so sad he's in rally macam
pathetic punya situation aku gelak gila
lepas tu like
macam kesian lah dia sekarang cakap K aku I read this news
they said that donald trump declares said dah balik daripada COVID nineteen
sebab dia nak sebab dia nak masuk election macam dia nak buat campaign
four more minutes lagi empat minutes
oh tahan
cepat lah please
aku rasa kan kita akan fail kita punya first try
no I think that use moment english but I use one malay so aku tak tahu like is like the same
uh takpe lah takpe lah
it's okay at least kita cuba and get the experience
I would say aku pernah kerja sekali hari ini satu kali
towkay towkay oh ya aku nak cari kau
aku try ini like small business yang buat macam
small business um bag ke sebab aku tengah cari small business untuk collaborate for open a giveaway
like aku nak support dia orang lah
okay I don't know I mean I mean ah oh kalau kau kena kena giveaway prize apa
kalau it's you prize apa yang kau nak
sebab aku ah apa tu
aku dapat satu semua besok satu kalau besok dia just started
so macam aku nak ini di situ saya turun orang so it's like a phone case punya business
kejap okay tak apa if he were to send you a gift that is a bloody portrait
kalau betul lah eh tiba-tiba kau dengan dia together malay malay if kalau betul kau dengan dia together
dah dah dah dah that's right err
and the flirting turns into like is a conversation how I talk to all my other friends so kalau if if kalau kau tengah berbual dengan dia and kau kau macam just cakap
eh kau kelakar seh aku suka berbual dengan kau
ya exactly so why you not talking to me that is a flirt you leave the person like eh siala why she talk like that she want me flirt to her ah oo la la so that's when kalau kau dah cakap macam asal kau tak berbual dengan aku ya exactly kau tak nak berbual aku pe kau busy sangat pe I'm not that important
okay dengar dulu so after you're in a relationship that after that your partner if they say is it weird dah dah dah
no tak when you meet him
like gap lah macam he probably thinks that kau macam lagi kaya or some shit like that right
I know prior to that he keep saying macam
acting eh macam kau self-realisation padahal tak ada apa-apa habuk pun takde
no like is it like macam is it
oh my god why wait what it's just let to me specific Tinder atau uh Okcupid
Muzmatch is good there's a lot of um naive girls because you really really go through macam
to to the tee punya macam this one really my mother and my father must know if I go out date with you must bring you home must tell mummy daddy that is okay that's fine if you have the maturity of
amin abeh amin
correct ya this shit will end bro it will end if you really love your boyfriend you will listen to your boyfriend hundred percent if your boyfriend say tak nak kau you won't kau tak akan break up dengan mata air kau just to lepak dengan budak syafiq ni that means you're saying that this fella is much more important than that guy
if your correct if if if shit gets comfortable then you say I just want to hang with my friends then your boyfriend say ah buat apa
because I don't like you atau you don't like me either ways there was something more than a friend you give me no fucking purpose you give me money aku kasi uh I aku kasi kau berbual dengan dia dia tak bayar kau duit
atau dia bagi kau knowledge dia tak bagi kau opportunities in life get the fuck out because I'm your fucking best friend cause to me is like
to have any fucking goals to be busy with other shit than to lepak
would would not get mad with you meh he will get mad what pasal kau dah kau dah pernah berbual dengan dorang and and the way that your and your boyfriend will probably be pissed off because
if syafiq keeps telling you eh lepak ah lepak ah lepak ah when the first meeting problem starts with eh I didn't before sia there's there's gonna be this part of like
I would say because dia very religious kan kau just cakap macam just playfully flirt lah macam
things that make him feel like oh she really wants my attention like eh kau tak berbual dengan aku eh dah lama tak rindu seh or something like that so
it's not haram what I mean okay it is haram because you have the intention but then
I don't like people who lie I don't like people who chase after me I don't like people who like macam step uh apa ni eh uh like you can flirt lah but then like
faham tak it's so many red flags sorry but
I would further macam I would pursue him
faham tak so bila kau dah macam together dengan dia not not if let's say he starts to
like it's either you are a good boy atau you are manipulative
for real huh dia hantar you portrait kimak budak-budak kental pe sia confirm aku cakap dengan kau
you kena cheated also eh we might know he's fucking seeing girls now we don't know
pukiwek three years abeh kena cheated eh siala
you need to ask for details so if he is the type of man that is like macam
kawan aku legit bila aku kecil-kecil kan dia memang betul religious habis the family and very baik so
shy baik and are religious so she she talk to guys from Muzmatch Muzmatch because she's shy to talk to guys in real life and she's also very religious so is very scary lah for you to just macam socialise what
she's the type that don't even wear tudung depan uh pakcik makcik
so legit eh ada orang datang pakai tudung pakai tudung that kind of thing atau macam
eh uh berbual pun baik macam budi bahasa macam lembut so when when she go out with these kind of uh men uh
um pasal everyday they remind themselves ah oh jin selalu ada kalau tempat dua-dua berduaan jin cepat masuk that's fucking true let's be real macam and and that's why to me
in my head is like um if she already said that I want this this this this you you shouldn't complain cause if that's not the type of girl the ratio of the halal and haram is not for you
kau masih nak try try try tapi kau tak up there then how nobody's asking you for a lot of money people asking you for respect towards the girl so this is um
how do I say this ah everytime I give my friend benefit of the doubt I'm always right so macam
eventually will come true whatever I say maybe because whether it was lame maybe that's why sekarang ni dia macam cakap ni cakap tu so if she she say she don't want it then kalau um
he should know better what right that's what I'm saying you should have Muzmatch sia this is not like macam remeh-temeh girl tau it's not like macam
for me to and not because like eh aku no no no I mean my gift alhamdulillah is I can make anybody be fucking comfortable with me so I use that to my advantage
I'm nowhere where I'm at now but I fucking promise one day I'll get up there that is the kind of fucking response I want to get from a man faham tak
you're at his fucking like stage in life where your fucking life is so hard like macam you're going through a lot of uh problems but you have so much to do with it
you are not small boy it's not like eh family aku my family is uh uh poor I mean uh mak bapa aku sakit abeh aku masih kat sekolah
itu aku boleh bagi ah tapi buto kalau kau tengah kerja kau masih nak complain
you know that's why in my in my head is like macam
and like macam I just see through the fucking bullshit I'm not going to lie sometimes when I date date someone also
uh I'm blinded that was the one yang dengan the arab guy that I was with yang macam aku betul-betul sayang but dia macam
like dalam islam pun cakap a good girl is for a good guy if you don't get it maybe you should self-check so cakap dengan dia gitu maybe that's why I don't get the girl is so simple as that
if if you want to say that kalau kau nak macam if you play by insecurity saying that aiya aku tahu lah aku ni buruk aku tahu lah
and then diam lah sial macam do something about it because you're not handicapped there's so many other people that kena burn on the face
and can do nothing about it but did they fucking complain no like macam ya so
you already fucking put your dignity on the fucking floor you step on it already you send a girl a portrait what the fuck sorry aku macam really that's that's weird
it's weird ah macam
how to say ah it's weird it's weird unless kau macam
fan mail then legit kena call fan sia fan I also want to vomit sia huh kau fanatic dia ni when she's just a pretty girl there's no such thing other than that
no you should tell him straight ah eh kimak kau lame pe kau hantar perempuan gini that means before aku kau hantar perempuan apa eh macam tiba-tiba
what the fuck do you do with your free time kau scroll perempuan lawa pastu kau hantar portrait
if you don't like him right trust me if you don't like him I I know that kau perangai kakak-kakak kau punya orang boleh steady punya tapi kau dah kau dah suka
once you date me you die already you die already all my my macam bipolar attitude
all my shout I tell you already what I'm abusive what back then lah you know like I don't give a like bro aku boleh ambil kaca aku boleh campak sia muka kau pun aku boleh pecah kan sia and as a guy also
who the fuck macam owes you a fucking living that you have to change them your mother father lah but not your partner faham tak so
that's why to me is like if you are at this stage to like kau dah mature enough don't lower your standard for a man who doesn't
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be with him I have friends who literally the the guy masuk jail cakap once you are a millionaire then you marry me and he fucking learn eh
that is weird let's see kalau kau betul-betul cut contact let's see who else he send the portrait to bet ah
faham tak cause
ya so that's why aku cakap kau it it all takes time what people especially when you like someone bro
and you've never been he been been uh at his lowest point of uh point in his life have you ever be that kau tengok kau boleh tahan ke tak
you fucking tell me engkau then apa diam ah sial then you want you have a better goal lah like it's simple as that macam
uh that that that that's where I play my game faham tak of like
I pick my battle lah macam okay this guy is enough for me
tell you before leh fuck bro kimak aku punya boyfriend dulu eh perempuan hantar dia macam
eh I saw you around school you look cute aku maki sia buto siapa perempuan ni dia nak tengok-tengok you buat apa dia pasal what
asal kau you can be vulnerable but at the same time you have you have to be like I know I know sleepy
bapa aku sia nama bapa aku sial
then you're much more clearer instead of nevermind just let it be it's okay so that's why I'm telling you kalau
if he if he's not confident he don't pass the confidence punya
wait but then saturday sunday kau buat apa kau keluar dengan dia
okay ya then then just hang with them like macam you want to have fun that is that is that is proper fun bro
stop it like macam if you tell your if tell your oh my god I don't accept that shit like my my partner got tell me before macam
oh I went out with this girl I tak pernah I tak pernah
dia gila-gila kan I tapi I tak pernah uh apa ni
my boyfriend said that he doesn't he just use like he just know that oh this girl got got macam
all due respect like he try to not I don't even know if he does that lah but he said as like macam okay I'm just your friend I'm just your friend but then I simplicate whatever text you send me so he told me that he never liked her at all
you want to fucking go out with her because she got connection because she can give you some sort of like macam um
help with ke apa lan jiao
go ahead with it or whatever kalau macam nak tanya advice about macam kerja in the future ke apa go ahead with it but I'm not
like macam is not more of like macam oh I reciprocate back
so right now you are reciprocating back if your boyfriend were to tell you in the future you ada keluar dengan dia tak you pernah keluar dengan dia tak I was fond of him lah
tapi I tak pernah mata air dengan dia
I can safely say that because I went out with a guy that fucking cheated kena cheated three times still fucking stupid
ah aku pun nak terkencing so how many more
so you telling me I want to belanja you or what
motherfucker aku nak patah balik I need to go back
tak boleh lah you cannot be distracted

ayah wah sudah tak buat ini ah gathering
then from dia kirakan like mix lah english english singlish melayu
okay boleh
wait avengers pasal apa
captain america tak nak
what do I like oo I like comedy oh damn eh err superheroes I won't say specific superheroes like not really like a group of it so aku rasa macam group macam a bit too much gitu
macam you don't even know who to focus on right so if you have to choose then it will be spiderman but only the toby maguire version I don't really like tom holland the character
dia macam a bit awkward
um so dia
so like the way that he act macam
macam half-hearted gitu macam dia nak tak nak gitu
did you just see the the the one yang uh andrew garfield acted ya ya watch all spiderman exactly I think that's why I think it relates my life I don't know
ya aku tengok kat suntec tak tak salah
tak yang movie yang err real life action nya aku tak ingat siapa yang
sedih pe rumah kita kotak-kotak dok kau serious
apa dorang jual dekat supermarket
okay so kalau kita tukar penjara kita macam norway kau rasa boleh jalan
confirm ada banyak order in their own prison cell and and the fact that like in terms of like relapse I think like people will enjoy going prison because they know compared to singapore punya let's say err four room flat
amenities tak ada
so ya I think you really have to see dia punya apa ni culture
eh siala rabak sia
aku boleh pilih ah dia punya
macam tak biasa ah
eh sial lah aku tak belanja sia aku sedih sia cause last year last year aku macam bingit sendiri dengan sendiri tau
err aku tak ada duit kalau aku kan kerja kan eh aku tak kerja aku sekolah
so aku fikir cam simpan dalam apa dia punya basket eh shopping cart dia
benda-benda yang aku nak beli takleh afford
sedih sia
err entah macam
aku rasa aku terbawa-bawa dia punya feeling for sebelas sebelas punya sale
macam it's nothing for me um macam I don't have to worry about eleven eleven because there is black friday
because at the point of time last year black friday aku beli benda so but eleven eleven tak boleh sekali masuk kot aku rasa
kau takleh ni eh macam err collaborate
apa right right right
oh benda dia jalan
anting-anting jer kecil besar
macam stud gitu ah
sembilan puluh lapan siak ah beli kat shopee lagi berbaloi
repurpose ni kan kedai ashley lah mmhmm
eh but then if you take like macam for example if you take like the buttons from a top a blouse for example Chanel buttons how would you know it's actually authentic
belum sia eh kau tahu kan yang one thousand note dah tak boleh pakai
okay bukan tak boleh pakai it's more of like it's obsolete now um so like whatever that it's like remaining out there in the world whoever has the one thousand ya so uh laki aku cakap simpan dulu atau buat investment boleh jual kat carousell berjuta-juta dolar tak aku tipu jer so I don't know
like apa ni
err apa emas
kat cash converter eh cash converter betul lah money max situ ah ah maxi cash
kau fikir aku kena aku patut beli sekarang eh kalau sembilan dolar
ye lah
apa ni ah apa
ya simpan duit dulu ah
ya sekarang tak boleh belayar pergi mana-mana kau tahu pasal yang travel bubble
ye ke no lah I think like I mean it's more like commercial travel but um
tak normal like normal nya allergies jer
sakit ah sampai nangis semua
serious dia
laki kau kena block rabak
kirakan kau dah biasa ah
oh dia pun
tapi macam siak jer
dia gardener
damn oh kirakan dia dia kenal tu market
cam dia dia buat survey tak pernah beli
oh pandai juga eh because I have no idea who wants exotic plants I never met anyone
so dia baru start ke
apa nama dia mid-life crisis eh
mm dah lama kan I mean bukan lama sangat lah
macam a few years but
I think it's a thirty thing ah you start to reflect on your life and your parents dia bukan muda lagi
asal kau fikir gitu sia
aku rasa at this point in time
comparing to like our twenties kita tahu kita tak solat lima waktu
and we're in denial of it macam other time in the future I will change but at this point in time like now you flapping I mean that's how I feel like aku cuba ah solat subuh like susah sia nak bangun alarm clock blasting here and left left and right
aku bingit sia selalu adamnya ringtone kan it's like super loud I just take his handphone just like this is so damn annoying dia punya vibration dia just semacam tau
its more mellow so bila aku bangun macam like oh bird you know its much more
compared to bodoh punya handphone
as a wife and and someone because I I came across this Tiktok belajar eh so I came across this Tiktok with post err they were mentioning about like err
my kesalahan right kesalahan aku it's not
on my husband's punya shoulder
my my kesalahan is all just like my fault but his is his but if I do something wrong and he didn't like tegur
so like it's the same thing as wife lah so sebagai isteri kalau aku tak kejut dia untuk solat subuh part tu kesalahan aku lah
so aku macam like aku tahu kan husband aku tak bangun then aku bangun kan dia so asal kan aku kejut kan dia kalau dia solat ke tak solat
okay aku tak tahu but that's how my understanding of it lah
like time kau bertemu janji
kau fikir macam like oh ah aku nak benda ni tapi aku tak nak bilang dia aku nak benda ni
and when you have this assumption and this hope and when the thing doesn't come then kau bingit sendiri
yes I I do acknowledge what you say because that's how my husband is like kalau aku tak tunjuk dia cara-cara
ah kesayangan ke apa dia fikir macam oh aku tak sayang dia so like I have to sometimes show him make effort
well and he does the same to me lah but for me I I rather have him communicate like what he wants or what he doesn't want because I cannot just assume aku aku macam in a way macam a bit
so ya sometimes dia macam hint hint hint then aku macam like what is it that you want and dia dia macam he's the kind of person who says things this way and that way and then macam like cannot make up his mind his decision then aku macam bingit ah
oh kau kau tolong dia ah untuk hantar barang-barang
tapi lepas yang kau cakap dengan dia dia harus berbincang like perasaan semua then apa dia cakap
untuk kau kot the way that you say it
dia mat teruk okay
what's that analogy credit card emotional credit card take it as emotional credit card bila kau run away kan swipe
you you you run away now you deal with it later so nanti dia accumulate accumulate ah then one day bam oh spark fire
eh dok Tiktok aku dah obsessed tau dengan Tiktok
tapi itu tak pakai that kind of idea untuk business kau sendiri
orh itu lah inspirasi kau orh dia filter tu glove putih glove apa lagi kau nak
kau tak ada glove oven sekali
yang penting aku angguk muffin
mungkin kau punya hidung boleh ni ah boleh sense kau tahu yang mingles dia boleh sense the weather berapa degrees
err aku kena unlock phone jap eh
um nak masuk tiga puluh lima minit
okay kita harus berbual
lagi sikit lagi jap maths aku tak bagus
satu jam enam puluh minit kan betul lah maaf ye saya mengajar seni lukis okay siapa eh
months adam has been obsessed with like watching documentaries so every single night before we sleep but he finds it as an entertainment so dia tengok um macam YouTube nya video semua
abeh dia ketawa-ketawa sendiri aku bingit lah macam like sial ah sis nak tidur sia kau takmo ah abeh buka kuat-kuat pula tu bukan nak pakai earpiece
then bro ya so like err I mean it's entertaining to them because like you know trump super confident so he's like in a way find this macam like a a filler for him to before you sleeps ya so aku first macam annoyed ah but then like err it's one day one night that I actually joined him is quite funny actually cause of the trump being himself ya allah
ketawa siak
kesian dia eh
kau nampak dia punya post

nanti aku tanya dia ah mana tahu dia tengah check dengan dia punya
kawan ah
err ada tapi dia dalam aku
so but tak banyak ah cause it's
aku tak tahu aku tak ingat ni semua adam punya ya cause okay aku tahu this is not a good way to do it but because my husband is a agent so aku serahkan semua kepada dia so macam like uh my mother is a bit upset ah macam like okay mean
um everything on the table what if you know what if what if right so that would be on me lah if let's say anything happens but aku sekarang macam like nak tahu benda ni semua pasal insurance investment aku macam segan sikit so bila aku nak tahu nanti aku tanya because it's just that that's why can you stop asking

to the free time I won't say free time macam
dia ada kerja mana ada kerja sikit it depends on how you see it

aku ajar art jer
aku rasa untuk budak lah menarik because like the fact that they know that this err the first three weighted assessment is not as heavy as last one so they can learn at their own pace but some students especially the sec ones
dorang macam like
rasa macam like dorang dah like gerek ah macam like eh tak payah belajar then ni ni jer buat buat quiz jer buat group work jer ah tak payah kita relax jer ah until they reach to the end eh bila macam september sept holidays eh sial lah next week ada peperiksaan sial lah aku belum belajar eh sial lah apa sia tu aku belajar dari january tadi ah so dorang panic ah so if they would have to grasp they if they have grasp the concept
of the this topic that they have learnt in err in from january onwards right then you don't have to worry you ah but kalau dorang macam like ah aku tak kesah aku boleh belajar procrastination and it won't do
online tak online dorang tak belajar langsung
siak aku bingit siak nak ajar dorang online satu ah selalu problem apa camera
cikgu tak boleh nampak ah cher cannot see you pasal aku tak on lah bodoh its like err okay teacher cannot hear you then you unmute lah ada message cher I just woke up

example eh budak-budak ni nama dia azmi
dia tak dia bukan online ah dia dia dia dia tengah tidur ke apa
okay can anyone call azmi please terus senyap
um everyone can hear me right nod nod will be nice tak ada sikit ah satu dua tiga budak aku nod okay can you call azmi senyap
then aku macam sial ah apa siak
kau tahu aku kena call azmi pe sekarang then lepas tu aku type dia punya yang class monitor ya aku err tapi dorang tak respond I don't know they are scared to talk online or something to show their face oh my god so difficult aku tak tahu how ugly they look dude I seen you in school I know how you look like for goodness sake nobody cares oh my god aku nya online tau aku busy online aku pilih debate so technically its gonna be very hard the thing is we talk and we need to see each other face
to react on the on the reactions lah ada budak perempuan ni err kat rumah kan so tak payah ikat rambut ah boleh rembang kan semua aku rasa dia baru habis mandi dia main rambut dia kanan ke kiri twirl twirl twirl abeh senyum-senyum sendiri kat handphone eh sial ah aku bingit sia aku ambil video abeh aku tunjuk kawan-kawan aku

something like or engineering end up you nak go to like something yang tiada kena mengena before you studied
higher NITEC cert but I rasa kalau dah dapat diploma
tak apa lah like oh tak mahu berbual pasal kerja lah stress

I had a lot of assignments dengan to complete and it was really nerve wrecking for my internship cause it was at a hospital lah
tapi in all I guess my poly life was quite fun and interestin
mm aku tak tahu ah macam mana nak bagi kau tips but because like it really depends on your course since I was in biomed kan more of my assignment was more into like theory based punya</malay
tengok kalau aku nak bagi kau tips pun aku rasa tak manfaat kot cause kau pernah bilang aku that your course is design righ
err I'm currently working full time at P&G as lab analyst dekat</malay
it's a microbiology lab ah so called kau akan buat testing to like you know facial products and shit like that penat sia kerja I mean like there's there was a lockdown right like during the COVID perio
mm aku actually actually planning untuk sambung sekolah cause aku rasa righ
oh aku tak tahu that your sister was in because I'm planning to go to juga um as a part time student in biomedical engineering cours
aku rasa part time student is the best for me right no
mm pelik kau punya cousin boleh pecahkan kau punya specs sia
mm maybe lah if I got time err in the future and maybe I have enough money aku temankan kau buat specs lah cause I feel like I also need specs my degree also keep increasin
mm we can't really go outside unless they are for like necessities and stuff like that ya rindu seh keluar dengan kawan semua especially karaok
mm like I say limited places sebab like some places pukul sepuluh dah tutup seh so macam</malay
ya that sounds like a good plan tapi like as I said mm semua orang pun busy aku pun busy juga since I'm looking full tim
um ahead kau nak pergi staycation err
kau ada ke hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
mm actually that place one pun bagus juga ah I went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre period like before circuit perio
kalau ada room service pun baik juga</malay
mm talking about shangri la I came across the article dekat apa tu the smart local if I'm not wrong pasal the shangri la
I don't know lah it's entirely up to you I don't know I also don't know when the promo ends also I aku rasa it's end of this septembe
tak salah aku ah
aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat shangri la how was the place like I know my friend work there before but has
he said the food there nice lah but tak halal lah
mm ya maybe we should ah but we really have to plan well I guess I mean kalau tak boleh staycation pun I guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit I have a list of it lah maybe I ca
ya I remember pemalas malas nak jalan oh I remember that cafe I think it's like hot chicks or somethin
aku recommend kau pergi I mean we we can go to cat cafe dekat rail mal
very cute kau boleh main dengan kucing while you like have your dessert or some stuff mm cause I saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad lah it's affordable and other than tha
the mind cafe is just like macam apa ni you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu
uh uh mm maybe can ajak ayu also ah bu
pelik it's weird ah I scared I'm awkward with her I mean you you're closer with her I guess I don't kno
I mean ya lah aku tahu during secondary school I was a nerd lah cause I was really focusing on like you know finishing my O's going poly and shit s
I mean I had a I I mean I talk to guys during that period but I don't think dating was an option cause I mean you look at our school lah lelaki semua pecah sia
let's be honest can't they're I mean they are not pecah but they're not like you know nice people so I rather not be attached to the
I will do my part also I guess you don't really need to show everything online lah for me ah cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
I don't know I just don't like sharing it's weird I I don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that I'll I'll feel weird doing that I guess it's just not me ah
a few days you can come to work kan macam tak fair seh kau tak akan earn tak akan apa ni hold duit yang cukup untuk sekolah and for your own like needs sebab aku tengok kau design kau selalu macam</malay
kena pakai printers semua untuk print kau punya project so tu semua pakai duit sia
huh someone got fired who sia siapa seh what happen I'm curiou
tak baik seh manager too I mean she's doing baking what is she suppose to split herself int
apa eh orang kata be mor
flexible I guess like if she's really busy baking for the shit right I mean baking for like you know the breads and stuff like that then like at least her as a manager she can handle the cashier what tak salah pe asal dia macam gini sia tak faham seh
on with that kind of salary plus um aku ada bilang kau ke tak yang aku punya matair sekarang tengah kerja temperature taking righ
dia punya his pay also got cut like previously it was twelve dollars right but now they cut it to eight fift
really face this kind of people like kesian ah juga cause of this like COVID thing right so they had to hire people for like temperature screener but some people are jus
safe entry damn leceh leh huh must walk one round ah just to go to the entrance I mean like it's for your own safety also gila ah
gila</malay
gila sia this kind of people like tak ikut rules abeh yang like they they are they they are the one who's doing something wrong abeh kita orang pula yang salah but it is what it is lah what can we d
you blah blah blah but I don't know don't really like ikut sangat cakap orang</malay
in short overall everything will work out fine anyways aku dengar after your interview kau keluar dengan kawan kau kan pergi mana jer merayap jer kerja</malay
like he pay for your stuff and he didn't do anything creep like that ustaz who is a creeper don't know why you go out with those kind of guys also those disgustin
plus sixteen ex is quite a lot so what does that mean he he matair for like two months habis tu break then another girlfriend is it sixteen banyak sia
just focus focus on yourself lah lagipun kau lagi muda there are other things for you to worry about like your school and your career there's a lot of things in front of you you have to achieve before you know finding the right on
pelik ah
age is not an issue ah because um kawan aku I have this friend ah my friend he's working together with me right no
age tak kisah seh I mean kalau kau lagi ada macam semangat kau nak sambung sekolah and you have the time why no
but I tell him the more he delay the more he procrastinate until when seh dia nak ambil like nak finish the degree then he was like and I've I also advised him lah lik
mm tak habis-habis go jer part time rabak</malay
a'ah I guess he just need to time have proper time management ah but aku dah tengok dia punya schedule dia punya modules and stuff like that I mean in short while if got wheels things will go on smoothly lah but I mea
aku lapar sia kau lapar</malay
ya kau asyik makan apa sia I do you have you tried the burnt cheesecak

melayu eh
mostly all chinese I think so melayu pun aku tak tengok
K ada satu jer aku tengok
apa eh
tujuh hari eh tujuh hari mencintai mu is it
aku rasa lah aku pun tak sure
serious satu jer
satu jer the rest I don't like it
dulu what
dulu kita tengok drama together what because there is timing for it what
kan aku pun selalu tengok suratkhabar just to tengok apa show yang ada for the day
and bila nak buka and bila tak payah buka at all
aku tengok that this one facebook post I think aku pun lupa bila
like that's when dia orang tahu that perempuan is actually lelaki they went for
they went for service punya
ya I mean in singapore it's called other countries I don't know but for service ni
seriously dia orang semua like most of the guys seriously they really look like a freaking girl
aku seriously seh
macam dah pernah eh
I mean mostly of my friends who have tunang
siapa boleh kasi aku attention wise
aku faham aku faham tapi kaucara kau cakap is like
because it's very different it's very different bila kau tengok eh everything it's all scripted what
that's why it relieves your stress level bila kau tengok cerita tu
cam kau get excited
so ada so ada voting punya ni lah
tak semua I watch bondi rescue
kau tau eh aku tengok that bondi rescue thirteen season it's to the point that aku cakap ngan mak aku nak jadi lifeguard
uh bondi rescue is like mm kau lifeguard so basically you just jaga this beach kau
no they are just on their job basis so basically this cameramen just come in just shooting their everyday punya
no but you know it's very how to say ah macam
macam dia puaskan hati kau tau yang bila diorang actually
inspire me ya something like that because aku tengok kan this one season kan they diorang fail to apa tu uh save this couple tau old couple
they are in their seventies kalau tak salah aku they only managed to save
dia ada tiga orang this couple dengan lagi satu diorang punya kirakan in-laws lah
kirakan adik ipar is it aku pun tak sure
ah betul lah abang ipar lah tu
melayu fail
so basically diorang bila diorang dah save this tiga orang kan no diorang save satu aje dahulu because lifeguards kat situ empat orang in duty
three of them just go there and save kalau ada orang drown lagi how
diorang nangis actually because they couldn't save
diorang rasa macam diorang salah diorang punya salah sebab tu kan
aku nangis because aku tengok diorang actually trying to revive that that couple back
really diorang really like went all out
betul ah
that's why they cry because they try so hard tapi they try to actually macam cover themself up ah because diorang tahu kan diorang being
tapi banyak orang like surrounding diorang macam like kind of like macam blaming them for not doing their job properly macam couldn't rescue them on time
kau imagine eh kerja kau as a lifeguard kau ada empat like only four of you and you expect them to rescue all of you who are drowing which is to me pada aku is just so sad
oh kesian kan
kan that's why aku I wanted to be at that one point of time ah because aku really aku admire diorang punya how to say ah macam diorang punya semangat untuk kerja
kau tahu eh after that that three lifeguard eh two lifeguard took a long leave because they were was ah because they were affected by that thingy
abeh ada satu lagi that one episode before diorang habis tu season
yang satu budak ni actually dia carik bapa dia tau for three hours kat beach tu beach tu memang besar gila ah
dia ada north south
ah K basically K you get the point lah eh dia punya laut besar
dia cari bapa dia tiga jam pastu last dia pergi that tower where all the lifeguard is there dia cakap uh apa aku tengah cari bapa aku boleh tak buat announcement
yang kau tahu yang this one lifeguard actually cakap yang tadi aku try save this one old lady
aku try to save this one guy but then by the time aku sampai kepala dia dah takde
ya he wasn't sure at all itu orang ke batu
tak save because dia tak tak boleh cari
because diorang save is pakai board tau
pakai diorang diorang sendiri swim
surfing surfing board tu diorang sendiri pergi
K lah after that bila budak tu patah balik eh diorang punya mindset is all the lifeguard kalau selagi takde datang kat sini cari orang kirakan itu is batu bukan orang it's a good thing
dia tak move then after that bila budak tu datang dia cakap aku dah cari bapa aku dah tiga jam
semua orang got called out because they had to do a search in that laut
they they went there for holiday but then it ended up and the saddest thing is kau tahu on that day he died it was his birthday
aku nangis aku seriously mak dia dah pengsan anak dia dah kirakan nak jadi the strong pillar for the mother
he just stand there ah just wait for someone to actually bawak body dia masuk
aku emotional lah
itu dah lama seh
eh but diorang punya joke is very far how to say eh it's very
kau nak kene really like tangkap that to to actually understand
it's kelakar pada aku kelakar gila no okay dia punya joke is very
kau nak kene really understand
what if you watch properly you will understand that diorang punya joke is really mendalam
cam it's just inside joke
kalau if you get it you laugh if you don't get it you dont laugh you know that kind of shit
pada aku lah it's fun lah
aku kecik-kecik aku takde dreams seh

ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone lah got a lot of different flavour ah like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
maybe that that's an option but I will still rather sedap mania ah sedap mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right kalau colour hijau then this price kalau
kuning the other price right colour hijau do you remember because colour hijau is the cheapest mah right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
oh sounds yummy ya okay apa
ah it will be nice right I went to the website just now then I saw they got a satay soup base laksa soup base I'm like wah confirm sedap ah macam gitu
baik satay sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
tapi I tengah diet
tapi takpe lah hari ini dimaafkan lah
cheat day yes betul tu cheat day
macam mana I tak tahu kejap I tanya adik I adam
adik I mata tutup ah tiba-tiba
apa B B nine
err bukan bukan bukan
ya bukan
so okay kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni eh mari kita
ah nak cakap pasal orang tak
tak senonoh gitu eh
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious um apa kita nak berbual eh um
uh kita punya keluarga or okay no lah no lah ah shares lah stock market lah eh
so um you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
but I tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
I think kalau I I will beli the stock uh for what I have now lah my capital yang ada I would probably invest in cheaper stocks lah singapore based stocks like
uh old chang kee for example err murah jer you tahu tak old chang kee dia punya share price is err enam puluh satu sen saje tau ah serious a'ah betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
berbaloi lah then I I I mean ah I was looking at their annual report then old chang kee kan
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region kan then agaknya I would think lah it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like um they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend lah so I mean that's my thing lah cause sekarang I don't think I I boleh mampu lah tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing lah on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client tau so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh lah kita tak boleh ambil dia punya um benefits lah from that stocks so ya I don't know lah I tak tahu lah ni semua islamic financial ah you tahu tak anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it lah that time I went for this uh website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's uh allowed or not haram or halal lah in that sense tapi the problem with that website ah they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then I'm like alamak then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but I would say it's good lah like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay lah that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
ya I think bagus lah kita sekarang err I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive lah
so ya bagus bagus bagus
you rasa
you rasa
good tak stocks
ya anyway err betul tu ya but I heard kan itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
um okay apa eh nak bilang you oh ya anyway I I found out there is days
technically grow your money but with very low return lah so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank lah
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like uh macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more uh
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
wasted lah I think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
ya lah wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam seh if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
can lah nanti I call dia orang
ya lah I call lah I call lah I bilang lah kenapa ni right
for the idea of islamic finance because technically um you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu lah it's haram because you would need to kind of know mah yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep eh berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul I was looking at um the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting lah because uh one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are err they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
SOCOE will be a good tapi I pun macam tak faham sangat lah how how the SOCOE um investment works but halal kan dia kan so boleh lah eh
oh kita punya trip eh ah I tak tahu lah I I punya adik kejap eh I call my adik hello
adik I baru kentut adik I kentut adik I lepas ni nak kena
I tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and I don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut ah I think maybe yes lah dia nak eating lah agaknya rasa gitu ah
ya ya itu I I I tu tak okay ha ha so anyway um
nak pergi makan I pun lapar sekarang belum makan so I pun nak pergi makan actually kan is hafizah going or not to sedap mania like what what do you think the chances are
mm mm ya lor actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
aiyo unless kita just go somewhere to like makan lor
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan lor
I would think maybe seletar cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan oh maybe we can eat at seletar airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
I tak tahu what are good things for us to makan eh err
okay lah nanti I berbual dengan I punya adik lah mana kita nak pergi
but ya lah kita try lah I I pun lapar eh I I want to eat sedap mania
ah tengok ubin also
eh I didn't know tau ubin ada macam malay punya makcik jual I just recently found out I'm like what
ya lah okay tak nanti I kena banyak pujuk adik I lah
betul betul tu eh oh ya by the way just now I was looking at sedap mania punya website then uh
they have a lunch promo I think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments lah then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm lah
ya besok lah I I okay juga kalau esok besok I think besok confirm tak ramai orang eh kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see ah besok monday I think I got nothing on
kita terus pergi ubin I boleh tapi perempuan I don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina I think dia kena exam so I think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
boleh juga kita cycle ke ubin
oh what's new ah like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
marsiling tanya lah
car lite I think is err I think kalau the most expensive one right is err four dollars per four or six dollars per fifteen minutes
tak jadi lah gini
actually one hour eight dollar blue oh tak lah blue blue lagi mahal lah
I haus so ini air mineral water eh
eh a'ah lah kita minum air sama
oh tak lah ini kecil punya meadows
ya ya ya ya correct imagine dia orang tak
tak catch the fizz thingy then they just let people drink then they just let people drink wah
like err what's that word aniaya
eh takde lah sampai gitu
apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah lah
ah macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh kan
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
ah ya sekarang I see biscoff dekat out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam I pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli lah ya
makan lah sedap tu I buat cake pakai biscoff
coconut oil I I tak jual I beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut I sekarang macam berang kan so bagus ah bagus moisturising
alamak apa jadi
gini lah I sekarang
nak find ideas lah want to like the social mission
tapi I pun tak tahu so in singapore apa social mission you can solve
mana boon keng is it
at this block block block sebelas eh
ada yang sebelah main road tu yang you pass by satu block macam horizontal
ah block block tu I dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak eh block tu ada dadah semua I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
oh distant eh jauh lah tu
nama dia Q
ya so macam mana you tahu ni Q tinggal kat boon keng
I see I see ya I mean is is it because dia tinggal kat boon keng takde bapa ke tinggal boon keng pasal takde bapa
I I curious lah macam you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
oh dengan datuk dia
contohnya apa khabar eh are you close with the datuk
mak dia doctor apa though
like wah so I mean not bad eh walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang seh then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
ah psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
bagus bagus bagus very good
I actually now you speaking of which ah I think I met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the boon keng area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so I was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat lah eh doctor dengan kucing
ah a'ah lah agaknya vet I mean we don't know lah pasal career banyak
but I mean okay lah so maknya consider good lah doctor
good lah tapi anaknya
um I tak tahu I heard anak dia
ah I don't know how I heard lah where I heard lah agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang ah sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
maybe dia punya anak needs treatment lah like like do you think so
a'ah lah agaknya lah however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this um Q your distant relative we can ajak her lah go makan oh maybe sedap mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
duit so
lagi more reason lah takde lah takde lah
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true lah if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally lah eh macam mana her eh I tau eat him or her up like internally
mm ah kenapa ni
um sentosa I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu I tak berani
tramp punya trail then we just macam
you cannot claim compensation lah because it's at your own risk mah you masuk tempat gitu so
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good lah cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
can also then luge macam laju lah a bit too fast don't you think so
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam lah or we can go like in the evening macam cold kan begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib I mean
mm okay okay then then good lah I would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine lah should be fine lah
I I sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock mahal juga
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
a'ah lah laju sangat ah
wait ah let me see ah apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so uh
eh I heard dia banyak burung uh okay anyway I tengok hit rock actually ada boleh lah err
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh lah mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
oh okay oh okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh lah because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
tapi I tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan I think is bungee jump I don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi I takut lah I don't think I I can lah
eh ni macam interesting juga eh
ya naik segway
let me see eh kayak eh takde lah
takde kayak
actually we can take cable car I I pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the sentosa one just three dollars mah
ya ya ya so we can do that lah so it sounds like a plan ya I think it it or if you want sentosa island bus tour ten token I mean macam lame lah
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal lah mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token lah untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
eh boleh lah you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda lah
okay lah adam adam pun nak kan pergi so I ajak my adik also everyone lah this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken just now I was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
err let me think maybe dekat maple city ah dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu err they have one in great world city
I am sure a bit out of the way ah um unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat ang mo kio hub eh
lapan ada eh eh lapan ada lah ada jer tau kalau kat north kan
a'ah geram I wah not bad eh eh but I don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars I'm not too sure tapi worth it seh twelve dollars
uh I'm not sure about the harga biasa but I think it will be much more than that lah definitely much more than that but actual price I am not too sure actually I pun tak pernah makan I just saw this on the telegram group
so we got two more weeks actually so okay lah that's ons saturday tak boleh lah
ya lah but really looks good lah this section letak yucks okay
ada ada ada buy as you but we can buy or we can take the tram there also lah if you want
so I can just ah so can ya ya so segway I think interesting lah cause one hour dia bawa orang kita jauh-jauh semua
err they say okay so segway one hour eh I salah kot kejap eh
oh dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so lah so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
I I I tak tahu I I would think so
ya depan belakang kan
ya lah kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway kan the segway eh mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja lah half a
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
eh okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive
okay lah I mean okay so I think kita kalau nak we can go mega adventure park we can do one mega bound
macam tu lah would be best if we can like have a lot of like different different kind lah activities
ten token for one ride so kalau you nak we can do err one which is like five minutes confirm tak cukup tapi okay lah one one of ride and the other one is err the mega bounce mega zip so ten plus ten
you know that's one way lah we can if you want kita pun boleh pergi sea aquarium also ten token and it's it's a tour open ocean discovery tour sea aquarium
tak eh sedap seh I've been to aspirasi
ya or maybe we can go there makan first at seah im the aspirasi then after that we head into sentosa lah because kan nak naik the monorail also it's free what
tapi nak pergi pukul berapa tu kalau saturday malam sangat nanti kena macam rush
I okay tapi it won't happen one pagi
susah um okay lah we put it about three o'clock kita jumpa
ya three two two or three eh what do you mean force rabung maghrib pe
I think adam pernah pergi force rabung and he he say that is okay leh but he went in the day
ya that's why maybe tonight kalau jumpa then he can tell you more about it lah
kalau jumpa lah ya
so ya lagi tiga minit
eh okay lah so next saturday nineteen kita pergi lah what whatever time lah because I think kalau nak morning is gonna be difficult like habis not possible
two o'clock would be a very macam practical time two to three o'clock
um let me see sea aquarium tutup pukul five
pukul lima on saturday also five but we have a tour so I think if I don't know must follow the tour or own time own target so
okay so err tadi kan kita cakap pasal three wish tadi kita cakap pasal the three wishes kan for the year so you said that you already have one of the wishes fulfilled what's the other two that you think we should try to accomplish as a family or like individual
your youtube punya channel do you have a target like for the number of followers
because macam I thought like your the intention of the game right was to show highlights lah but if you don't have those kind macam those text yang dekat tepi tu say like to narrate whatever that the screen is doing because most of the people who watch the video dia orang tak on the audio what kau kalau macam the person switch off the audio and you just you playing macam tak ada some err text visuals to compliment you punya video so I thought like I don't know maybe it could be your first draft jer
oh okay I faham so that means dia punya the video that you are trying to achieve or your channel kan it's like macam highlights for that particular night punya game like what other wins and what are the near wins what are the losses lah that kind of that's that's the kind of like video channel that you trying to achieve lah
so I I I'm just thinking right is like it gives me that kind of macam those err it gives me that kind of impression macam when I watch people play game kan it's like it's as though like they are narrating something or like or what are they trying to achieve through this video macam it's just it's similar just like the makan punya channel or makan punya video it's like okay here's what I ordered for lunch today okay let's see whether it's
going to be delicious mm ya is very nice ya I like the prawn is a bit juicy you know but it's not something that your audience boleh visualise or taste or what you know so I I you is it something like that that kind of err are you targeting that kind of audience where people just watch it just for the sake of watching it but there's no there's really no purpose you just like to share that like
we were talking about a one one wish that you said that you already achieve right the five which you already got through the um your spidey spider suit right then then the one that someone was wearing is apa tu the spiderman the puffy one that's the one that your brother give
so I'm thinking if we could get a family one but I am obviously cannot wear it outside because it's haram because it's very very very ketat unless I wear it for swimming
because properly they cover all my aurat so I I mean macam if you see that is a good investment for us to like all the school shoes it's kind of different kind of combination then we can right
then ya we just take the measurement ah tapi yang the one you beli tu berapa ah
black cat apa cat woman what the shouldn't he just be a cat woman but it's leather kan cat woman punya
cat woman punya okay ah ada cat woman punya I nak ah
oh ya you dah telefon your mother to come tomorrow
no wah you tahu my colleague geraldine she encash fourteen days eh oh my god I was like
how did everyone accumulate two digit punya leave balance seh
ya no but for me is I think the work from home thing save me a bit because at least I can manage my time kalau tak already I tell you by august begitu kan I would already have exhausted all my leave already for safwan appointment the children vaccination and then you know remember saffi hospitalise
ya I guess that's the only one ah oh ya tadi kita cakap pasal what can you mentioned the IKEA punya cannot cannot fit are you sure like all the cabinets cannot fit
whether right we should just err err fix the cabinet dekat err the master bedroom side because um for this mean toilet I nak ada other some improvements in err in terms like macam there's that rail handrail so that down the road kan kita tak payah nak renovate
ya because adding the macam cabinet there kan it might like macam block orang punya as in it might block lah whoever who
wait the toilet renovations two toilet renovation ten K or just the jamban
then oh right that was not your right the one that err rumah dia is actually just opposite B P there right the resale kan actually no wonder they need to err hack the toilet because she um megan got tell me before the dia punya rumah tu macam quite rundown and then if they don't fix it kan macam is cannot as in there will be leak and everything lah
huh ya ke that means they just enter the house don't need to do anything
oh then who was the one who told me that they need to fix the piping and everything ya ke izzad punya rumah dekat mana
oh they take over they are not err apa tu getting a new house ah because I know the dia orang punya cousin wardah and umar kan nearby kan that's why they don't intend to shift ah
so bila ija bersalin
oh man tapi they they always give a one week one week
tak baik seh cakap macam tu
I think I think dia pun worried seh
eh tapi dah tahu lelaki atau perempuan
orh what tanya jer ah what the heck
I don't know actually right if I were to go through one more time ah the pregnancy ah I really want to have that element of surprise lah it's okay I'm just gonna push him up or push her out and then know the gender but it's hard because I need to prepare and I'm not someone who will tak boleh tak boleh like not prepare
it cannot that and then I know for me kan I can't although it's a good surprise right if it doesn't macam if I'm not wrong planning need or what right macam it won't impact me for example like is my kid so I know that I need to make preparation for it what cause like my kid keluar I need to macam make sure oh dia punya the bottle is blue for example and it's not in pink you know that kind so to me I mean we can buy neutral colours lah it's just that I don't know ah macam
macam ah very not that the bottles that I bought have to be blue is in green kan actually the bottle yang I belikan tu all green kan because ah safwan punya milk pun green dia punya apparel pun green ingat tak and then dia punya yang all the friends yang kita beli ni semua
colour hitam so it's like there's no gender coloured gender influence colour
ya but actually I kind of like the pink pink blue kind of combination macam those kind of paddle pop punya colour like you know very pastel kind is it pastel
yang dia rainbow tau yang paddle pop punya ice cream tu tau
actually I kind of actually I wanted the this room to be like that see like this blue kan kan it goes well with this kind of pink kan cantik kan
wah okay lah actually there are a lot of things that I want to improve for this house actually the very first thing right I want to do is actually kan I nak amend and fix the dapur punya counter top I really cannot stand the counter top lah ya macam so hard to clean it's like I think it's because of the the macam the gap
ya and then the thing is right the water the water doesn't dry out as fast as I want it to be I don't know whether is it because macam kita punya rumah is just so the window is just so closed up so that you you know you can't really like the wind tak masuk I did but the thing is when I wipe it kan there's still some a bit of moist
usually ya lah usually they will they have like some uh ventilation lah so that the tu so that the you know the surfaces would dry quickly
so that's the only thing lah I want to fix just the counter top I don't know whether is it as simple as just like knocking but do you know when you knock it out the apa tu pintu cabinet will pecah kan actually oh my god
so just now I was telling you I was talking about I was err my friend called ah from uh ya just like uh like so it was quite interesting because uh they needed a picture of a day doctor err then err the but suddenly you because the doctor is from our hospital tapi they need a doctor to be featured dia orang punya newsletter
but but the thing is the doctor submitted the picture that is not that they didn't meet their requirements of the but the printer lah so they needed us to take a picture then I was thinking like can't you just use the phone because the you know my Google Pixel ni I took I took a picture and err portrait punya macam mode kan
but when I when I send across kan it's at least three meg three four meg know that's why I don't get it macam why would you need like um a professional camera to take a photo when you can just take a photo with your phone and it is about three to four megabyte is it because like the newsletter is like dia require exactly three hundred because kita punya my mobile phone kan when I check uh is like hundred eighty
so no choice nak kena pakai lah
ya lah but we don't have so what I did to bypass it right is I shot I shot it in two apa tu two style eh two apa tu file format one is the raw one is the uh so kalau macam dia orang nak edit kan they just use the raw version apparently it works
that's what they that's what I did to bypass the macam the wall stickers I I don't know I don't know how to bypass it without having a so I just took into a in dua punya format then I send to the to the printer err not printer designer then I ask them to layout because it's a very big it's a big wall sticker you would say so you only I don't know whether you wanna if because our phone cannot take raw kan actually raw image it has to be set from a camera kan
are you planning to change your phone oh wait you change already ah I don't know whether I want to change a okay the thing is don't get me wrong I suka dengan my phone which is the model but I find it too big I just wanna pixel three I tak nak pixel but that time kan tak ada ingat tak I ordered online
it's it's really huge ah serious I just find it too huge but macam when I hold it on my palm kan I will need to stretch I punya thumb onto the other side of the screen just to type it
so I I was thinking I was torn between these two options either I ambil I ambil the ring and tampal you know the ring where you can put your finger inside and then you hold it or either I put the link card punya holder tu so I was thinking which one is more practical but of course is the link holder
the kids see that one they don't like tak sedap seh I don't like it's just damn weird oh but I like the ninja chicken burger though
love it I don't know the sauce is called nambam sauce or something like that namban tak pernah dengar seh that sauce
is never never heard before I pernah dengar macam miso err miso err teriyaki is like some people ask me whether is teriyaki I feel like is a mix of teriyaki and something salty I don't know what its chicken is nice you tak you tak try ke that time
kenapa kepala you pening tak minum air eh
you should just do eh tadi mana air I eh
oh ya anyway tadi weather was ya okay tadi the seller stop dekat mana
habis macam mana but is ready is ready ah
I'm just thinking like whether this person dia ada jangkit or what sebab tu dia tak kasi you picit the door bell no but don't even allow you to knock usually I don't mind knocking initially I don't mind knocking but door bell cannot doorbell is too loud
on the floor tak ada bench orh okay lor
that's very considerate of you all the deliveries yang I dapat all hang at the handle ah then I was like how am I suppose to open the gate without dropping it so I I pick up with my hand and then I open the gate nonsense kan that's very considerate and very thoughtful
so dua the dua is dari mana punya section
no but dia nak kena tulis apa like you accumulate like which is like blind spot okay right
tapi yang paling kelakar yang I tak faham is I punya kereta I pass sekali I punya motor I fail it one time
take so long to cakap I punya figure of eight eh take so long to finish lah figure of eight must be eight seconds
ya lambat must be more than six seconds
did I tell you some uh an accident that I witness on the on a plank orang ni dia err it was rainy um but ah it was sad lah because after dia I witness dia punya accident I think it was it will stay in my mind that I couldn't forget and then I fell on the speed you know the the you have to speed up your speed then you have to brake at the line ya correct so what happened at the plank was I was right behind this person
I tak tahu apa or kaki dia stuck or what kan dia went up the plank dia dah nak dah nak like maybe err err five metres or like maybe one or two metres away from the last one and then jatuh off and then dia punya gigi hit the another side habis chip off the two teeth chip and it was not a nice cut oh it was like a like a diagonal line
oh my god you I tengokkan dia and it was a guy yo I mean okay ah I'm I'm not saying that oh err guys should be okay girl shouldn't lah but seriously it was not even a test it was raining a practice session oh my god habis dia gini-gini dia asyik pegang dia punya gigi tau instructor ada instructor no but
but rabak he just trip like that you know even the whole gigi patah tau the dua gigi patah better kan
oh boleh eh as long as you find your because I I know he didn't pick up the thing ah
oh I see I though you tampal from the
sial oh I can't forget seh I tu dia terus kan I bailed I cakap is okay I think the plank very slippery I go the other one dia betul-betul I try the apa tu emergency break tu I think I step on the the the err back punya brake kan too hard dia punya is so weird tau the back tire just swing forward you know it's so fast you know it's just like swing macam ini seh then I drop on my left knee
tak lah tak pakai
eh ada knee guard ke ah
because you say nanti you penat lah you nak I bawa motor lah apa lah
it's just water what is not like rosak what
kejap kejap vendor for what the backdrop
oh habis sekarang
the vendor bail pasal you all make too much changes or the vendor bail pasal you all tak bayar betul-betul
uh huh habis
but not because you guys made banyak changes ah
apa nama company dia
you mean but the company is not father in law dia punya company ah
I see tapi you cakap lah maybe your kerja kasi you freelance
eh vendor tak nak buat dekat you all
the yang this video ni siapa yang minta dia
so the person that I don't really like tu yang siapa tu so this saturday this sunday she will officially become that number one lah
because I know whereby sitting as a board member you can err you will officially can become macam you voluntarily kan volunteer with err providing your remarks and everything kan so called strategic directions when you are just talking and complicating things right
that's like senang kata ah senang kata because too many cooks spoil the broth
the broth tak lah spoil the soup lah wait what's the what's the idiom again apa too many cooks spoil the apa apa soup what serious I suka ah berbual macam
pasal kita no
tak pasal kita pun sejak kita kahwin kan we only kita selalu keluar and berbual macam ini only when kita the before with kids are really easy our window is just like tanya okay dah alright any long conversation do it with a phone kan we are a phone phone ah what conversation ya
kalau lah boleh screenshot jer the text messages and then err verbalise it screenshot the old messages and then we just verbalise the the text messages that would be fun
aiyo I'm just thinking uh okay I'm just thinking yang sunday ni this sunday ni eh kejap you sunday eh this saturday you kerja kan sunday ada apa wait there's something on happening on saturday orh eddie kahwin habis why why your reaction like that
no but how do I tell my father that he can't come wait kita punya wedding is for what time to what time ah two hours jer kat pasir ris lah kan okay two thirty to four can nanti kita kita naik teksi sana unless you want to go the downtown east ah lepas tu
nak pergi downtown east tak lepas tu I don't know ya but I think nak kena book ah you know nak kena book you know eh no no no tapi I rasa dia orang nak pergi wild wild wet tau boleh kita pergi wild wild wet lepas tu
alah confirm the kids nak main the tayoh
wah that means this weekend we are completely filled alah eh this month siapa punya birthday lagi you cakap
no I mean family lah family siapa eh punya birthday
asal you tak ambil gambar bila you dah dapat kan senang
mm mana ada dah berhenti apa it's not lah ya lah ya lah
sorry ah I pakai contact lens please
kena lah it's just um the thing is that I have too many that I don't know which one to do first ya lah but usually
oh aduh the the the person yang email I ni dah apa tu ya yang tadi I berbual dengan dia tu dia dah email eh oh dia also macam I sama ah a'ah
tak lah what we are small fry we are obviously right that's why a'ah seh kita semua dari tu eh get that experience
dah lah that's the thing is lah a meritocracy world I don't know lah I just find that sometimes it's really the thing is dekat my place ni kan I don't know why is like your capabilities tak cukup tau you punya papers is to macam is to support dia punya capabilities padahal it's like
you ask the person to go to the kitchen you don't need to ask for that lah of course lah]basic is like have you pernah masak ke tak lah kan tapi doesn't mean tak pernah masak tak boleh masak benda sedap you know what I mean ya so I always give them this kind of theory so you suruh I buat something
but to compensate me to compensate me you cakap oh err I know you do a good job tapi but sorry you not wearing uh err this err nike shoes so you cannot be promoted you know it's just like you are just trying to find a excuse basically that's what that's how I how I feel so whenever I put into perspective to this kind of people just ya ya but it's not kita tak boleh buat apa-apa this kind of things are like beyond our hands oh the
then I will be like what then next time you ask me to do something I just say I could only do until this stage ya makes sense kan then bila I cakap macam tu will be like shit don't be too don't be too like err ini lah
see ah can can I just share with you about my work like the the things that I being asked to do you tahu I kena buat about this digital plan about this um publicity booking schedule tau this publicity booking schedule is not as easy as you ask for one to six eh I kasi one to six I have ten people who can be asking for one to six
so who do I give it to so it's really based I punya like okay for example maybe person A ada event then person B dia bukan event dia punya it's just a reminder ke some patient safety reminder so I have to give priority to uh ah I have to give priority to the A person kan but then the thing is sometimes is not as straightforward as that because what if
err you have three people who want to put reminders and you tak ada event so how do you negotiate so so that's the thing ah is it the thing is I can do it but it requires err half a day I cannot do this kind of planning kan macam like as a macam sikit-sikit sini sikit-sikit sana I cannot I need to do macam I need to really focus I need to do the schedule I will do the schedule for half a day that's how I do so sekarang ni so I don't even want to start on it
that admin person coming second jan a'ah wah because they are gonna serve notice one month at least so the thing is the funny thing about this person is itulah dia I don't know eh maybe err Q one end of Q one building up ya you dengar you dengar ni
actually I like something it's very funny tau this person yang masuk ni dia contact so many people around me except me tau to ask me about the job to ask about the job tau macam like
you could you just ask me what padahal kita but then I always like no orang yang dia tanya semua melayu like is like kau boleh tanya aku apa like ya shah aku dengar ada opening I mean macam we met every year because I give out the greeting cards and the apa tu the calendar and then at some point of time you need like publicity you also contacted me apa seh dia tanya orang yang dekat yang dah left a'ah macam dah transfer this one I tak tahu whether macam a'ah dia tanya sinar habis tu dia tanya meha except me
so I don't get it I mean like why would you ask somebody who who who left and orang yang tak kerja dekat department tu I don't get it seh
then I just like macam so I am a bit err I'm a bit like macam weary tau kalau macam why why she needs to tanya orang lain besides me because to me is I welcome internal transfer because I tak payah nak guide through macam that time ya because you can just ya because ya because you can just hit the ground running eh maybe they could have a better way
like bypassing certain things you know or work around certain things because the thing is although it's like a it's not a government a government sector kan dia ada we have more red ticks than the government you know and they very very macam very very rank conscious apparently you you macam like err of course I think sometimes what I want to tell my boss is that macam sometimes bukan
orang rank conscious tau is because like you tak boleh ask err a associate to be doing err punya kerja ya it's not a right what ans it is not because it's not it's nothing about do about your rank tau it's got to do with what you are paid to do you know so I I sometime I tak faham when people say like oh err you shouldn't be err you um saying that you just because you are associate you cannot do this
I mean is usually two sides to a coin ah you can see as like oh ya uh I shouldn't be err drawing lines about the work that I am doing but you also should look it at a perspective like if I keep doing this right then I'm being short changed and nobody likes to be short changed so for you to be saying this you are being selfish because at the end of the day you just want to get work done you don't care who but this person is is severely short changed so that that's the thing lor I I find that it's very hard to juggle kat at this this place I'm working at
dia macam tak dia tak err macam kalau kat yang kerja lama I ni dia very is very obvious tau macam you macam tadi my yang call I dia cakap dengan I err kat at least dekat kerja lama kita kan err we know okay this for this job cuma but the responsibility lies with the your degree holders the responsibility lies with them tau macam if thing goes wrong kan they are supposed to check
this and um they should be responsible um take responsibility for it and then now I heard they because they always change the person person kan ah baru punya orang and this person is from punya side lah so they are still learning the ropes to run that place ah side so apparently what I heard is they open more postings more openings for err diploma holders so dulu kan exactly so kan I bilang you there's ah err in that admission kan they have um
err the comms officer err assistant comms officer dengan abassir kan the one that I kan melayu they are very so now comms officer boleh pergi can take up the comms officer job
I know lah tapi macam ya no no but the thing is the opportunity to go tapi dia tak pakai tu ah ni ah tak pakai tudung ya so I mean it still applies lah I guess
I'm just thinking whether I should buy more of this err diffuser oil no wait I like it you don't like ah that's why you say macam the cockroach keluar malam-malam kan I mean dia orang mati kan I'm just thinking whether is it is it this smell that is causing them to be opening
unless it's like the baygon but the baygon cannot be is like dah lama sia I spray but if you notice this past few nights I tak spray tau maybe they just wanna commit suicide
I don't know no but err what I heard is you run over the tray kan you got you mati
no so what I did was I use the baygon I spray I spray a tray so the moment they pass this line kan they will die really you go and read about it is like you put them ya it's like baking soda so what they did was they put the baking soda punya powder tau then semua mati
bedak just normal bedak ah not bedak apa-apa
oh macam the the talcum powder eh
eh dah lama tak dengar khabar
um in the group chat lah bodoh
oh my god dia pun beli bija
who are what went downhill kau I mean like dia tak berbual banyak ke pe

feelings balik
they'll I don't know what what power lah okay but macam dia orang they have like this mindset right that they okay anything I say or anything I do confirm girls confirm girls will fall for it
aku dah cakap lah dia dia kalau comfortable dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu
adik kau pilih si izuan ke ah dia cakap eh kau ni bapak kau tak lawa tak handsome ke macam
I don't know why many people many girls find izuan handsome termasuk kau but
I don't know it's just me even elfie cakap tau ya ya oi that time aku tanya dia eh

I mean some other way kau boleh macam
if the feelings hilang already what
his one right I think his type of like macam
convincing or talk or apa apa ah in general
his type is to like macam lead you on
okay macam okay
humairah said that he still like macam cakap to you cakap
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he tak itu
so jangan don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
mm cheat juga so it's two ways
tak nak tanya lah
toxic bodoh
oh mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu
you can't K the thing is kau tak boleh expect like a guy to look so great
cause that's when you know macam kau kau confirm tak boleh dapat
you know it's not their hati yang gatal it's bawah dia orang gatal
terus dia reject
kau reject eh
oh ya kau tolak eh kau cakap I I'm still moving on
I think he said because kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua kan zack is the opposite what that's why he feels like very competitive gitu dia tak suka
alah kesiannya you but did you tell him that
kau cakap apa dalam letter tu
comelnya okay
you should just tell him that kau orang together not because your expectation of a guy is
macam you should say that at least he tried it's easier
oh dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat
okay I mean dia tak teruk seteruk aku tau but
kawan pun boleh eventually turn out to be so
that's that is the beauty of like having friends lah itu jer
selenge aku ketuk kau kan kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si zack depan-depan dia sia
aku I was like laughing behind the screen I was like I want to look at izuan's reaction

ya exactly it's not her what humairah madrasah ke takkan alim jer
you know that a guy from madrasah
suka dengan budak madrasah yang lagi satu then I'm like
but but look like at the kids yang dah pernah madrasah even if I don't know they have done it
K but very annoyed itu cerita lain ke
I literally gave up you know when he said that aku macam tak nak gaduh lah diam jer lah
he said what layer layer layer aku cakap am I not layering that one
feel uncomfortable ah like macam
okay it's not it's not bad that he tegur but tegur tu like
cakap baik-baik not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he macam cakap can you not wear like that macam gitu
nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the macam I'm the one wrong
tu pasal aku dah macam marah that's why I was pissed
aku dah cakap apa terang-terang like kau nak pakai itu kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu then it's not my problem
aku pun pissed gila wei gitu dengar
I don't know we were talking about oh no kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik
lepas tu aku tanya dia like husni was like talking because kita tiga jer kan dah biasa
then after that we just talk ah macam
err we need to talk about like macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia emo gitu
lepas tu aku bilang lah dia orang macam apa jadi
like as in apa jadi as in like uh why is she still feeling sad lah gitu
then aku just cakap in my opinion I think
dia masih belum move on gitu ya then after that ya
mm and then lepas tu
husni cakap maybe
err husni came to a conclusion he just said that um
because like uh that is why you shouldn't play dating app ni semua
ya then after that aku macam it's like aku cakap ah macam sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person itu jer
for fun also what kau nak kenal-kenal orang jer pe
tell me that uh takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga tau lelaki ni semua tak bagus
then after that aku cakap lah aku cakap dengan dia like uh the guy I talking to that irfan
I told him that about that guy ah macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu
husni cakap ya just um next time just be careful jer lah
then kata aku cakap um
aku bilang husni ah aku tanya dia in my in your opinion lah do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
pasal tu husni cakap no you cannot see anything what
it's just one line dah tu jer
wah it'll it will trigger me right if he say that dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini
tak he never say that before but if he says it that I'm gonna flip out sia
and the thing yang aku pakai tadi kan baju tu kan yang colour purple you cannot see anything what
ya it's just the ke belakang what
pasal dia tak berani nak cakap apa-apa that's why
kirakan apa birthday surprise dia bodoh
buka buka gitu birthday surprise
lupakan jer aku tak kisah
aku pakai gitu pun like I fikir about my family
relatives semua dah tahu aku dulu pakai tudung semua
mm itu sebab apa because that one time I suddenly change ah I just suddenly like that tak pakai tudung
nenek aku makcik aku ah like because kita dah rapat gila that's why I don't mind what they say ah
then she she very abeh dia baru lagi
I I I just jawab ah tak ah dekat jer nak buat apa
lepas tu dia kata huh gitu eh
ah gitu lah buat apa
so just kalau kau tak pakai takpe lah
this is the first time I post about yang I tak pakai tudung just ambil gambar biasa jer kan
not tegur as in bad tegur ah dia orang macam cakap eh lawanya
I'm not trying to brag ah but they said eh lawanya kau pakai gini
then I was like oh okay thank you gitu
just so I don't try to bring it up lah gitu

pasal dah ya lah
tak lah
aku pergi mongolia royalty tu
even the girls that I know that pakai tudung kan right
they they buka somewhat they same time as me I mean after me

cause dah biasa kan dah daripada dulu kecil then after that
kecil as in I started seriously wearing sec one
then the lepas tu holiday pasal aku ada internship kan aku tak pakai
then from then aku tak pakai
sebab tu aku macam like a bit hesitant to wear lah
it's very stupid if they ban that lah macam bodoh sangat lah
that's that's the bad thing you know because it's your adik right then you are the kakak you're supposed to show example then they they have the mindset that
ya you're supposed to learn from your kakak that's all
I mean doesn't suit as in macam kau tak ready gitu
lepas kahwin then okay lah maybe
like because we ignored it right macam kau try to avoid it that's why dia dah malas nak cakap
kalau aurat tu boleh tunggu I know it's a good thing to
obviously you ngaji kena pakai pe

because it was a voucher yang kita beli dekat you know celeb fest kan kadang-kadang ada kan
ya and then after that makcik aku beli so it's hundred dollars altogether
it's hundred dollars altogether so fifty for me fifty for her then fifty tu aku pakai untuk perming ah so buat pedicure
ada sikit leftover then they refund sikit
so aku macam okay lor
tak pernah eh I just don't want to do anymore it looks very unclean that's why
later a long time later nanti dia karat ya that's why I don't like

dah um semalam ada meeting err dekat conference room
ah aku gather all the ten of them lepas tu dalam ya ten of them split into two accounts
so dalam two account tu ada dalam
aku nya old team ada empat orang
err the other team ada enam orang
six six orang dalam team lepas tu kan ada social distancing kan so aku approach err safety manager ah minta pasal aku nak get the message relate to them across um but um I don't want to split the err dua dua team aku nak err two teams to dengar apa aku cakap as one so dorang tak confused
I want them to know the anyway boss aku memang the the day before
dia dah dah cakap dengan aku lah what to say dia cakap firstly about the unpaid cuti tu jangan
jangan bilang customer
don't tell the customer just say that we are clearing our leave tak tahu apasal boss suruh macam be confidential about it padahal it's quite known in singapore banyak orang sebab tu in the end um but I have to say what she say lah she's on leave dia tengah cuti so um during the meeting everybody um listen semua dengar semua ye so the two err explain that the two unpaid leave tu nak kena ambil december
february dengan march
then kalau macam the situation doesn't improve
err start for this err unpaid leave cuti kena ambil
compulsory you cannot macam bawa to the next err month you have to err settle lah within that month but rotate err every member kena ada backup dalam office
so that at least ada one person to answer customers' calls
kena ah so macam today is one of the unpaid ah
unpaid cuti err for december hari ni aku ambil dengan another day next week
so dalam bulan december aku kerja seven days only
best kalau boleh pergi holiday
and tak tolak gaji
ah free kan dapat
ya I think civil servants ada restriction kan
but two years eh kawan aku kata they don't know indefinitely
then macam mana um then how they clear the leave
I think they can break I think they will pay that time got ada keluar news apa
aku tak ingat apa ah tapi ada ada incentive the government say because they know that the civil servants cannot clear leaves
so cuti they will back they will back pay will cash or something
ada kan
for civil servants confirm ada that day baru ada pe they will they will pay the err they will bayar
tapi tak ada yang you know the apa usually apa bonus tu yang
extra berapa bulan for government civil servants ah that one tak should be tak ada adik aku pun tengah
she also mengeluh because
biasa ah kita dah beli beli beli barang we always macam nak kena
they hope they hope dia macam she hope for the bonus to
dia boleh bayar balik ah bill bill

kereta memang necessary for korang pasal korang a family of enam
family of enam enam six cats seven cats
tapi alhamdulillah lah aku rasa ada berkat lah macam I'm sure somehow eh dia dia cukup tau cuma kita macam rasa macam we maybe because we don't see the the income coming in every month as a lump sum eh so we think macam
we are restricted tapi actually barang-barang semua masih still go on
dia penatnya apa bila kau kat rumah then dengan kerja while working nak kena tengok budak tengok rumah kemas lagi sebab tu macam overwhelming
time masa off
mm betul
jemput makan eh jemput minum sila kan
dah dah settle
bila dapat tu results
then dia nya first choice ah
yang yang okay what secondary school will that be
masa masa zaman-zaman kita tu the reputation not very good ah
oh but eh now maybe dah changed ke
oh the neighbourhood situ eh
tahniah for your result
ah jual besi
every month every month macam one point three for one account tau
so yang bulan lepas err our sales
cuma two hundred fifty eight K
tak drop banyak tu from one million err dia dia start turun bila tau bulan june july august
dah start to decline then the number of orders we used to get like hundred over orders dalam satu hari
sekarang satu hari dua tiga ke empat order macam system and it's like cutting metals for like a few inches orh really really very bad the demand drop
err dorang buat dorang assemble untuk ah the machine assemble untuk ah oil rig masuk kan dalam oil rig
so you know yang macam equinox err shell axon order kat all the oil rigs tu when they put things inside the down hole stuff too ah that metal they they buy from us kita kirakan macam distributor ah sell the metal kerja memang sebenarnya kerja aku ni jual besi
ada macam-macam size the round bars the tube all the tubings nanti they will order macam certain sizes then we need to look at the drawing sometimes they say ah we want to make something from this so what do you have dalam stock
to offer um benda-benda gini ah nanti dalam inventory tengok ah size yang kena ada abeh aku kena plan inventory for them the stock level must be always available so that bila dorang beli bendanya ada tak payah tunggu
cuma different product ah barang lain so
somehow yang bila yang last year tu bila aku dapat promoted tu from one account they ask me to also take over another account
so kirakan macam two accounts combined ni is the two biggest account dalam company mm
which is unexpected lah yang pasal aku kan baru habis cerai that time kan
then ah after the divorce tu
somehow ah aku tak tahu ah then the boss yang cina tu kata um we need to look into your portfolio you need to grow yourself so
then err dia tanya aku nak ke tidak macam if bukan aku dia akan offer to another person then the other person if not ambitious ah this girl dalam company aku ni there's another account manager yang very ambitious
then dia pursue dia punya degree at the same time I with her own money pasal dia nak aku rasa dia nak position boss aku boss aku asia and ah
asia-pac marketing and apa eh marketing and apa director
so dia kata if you don't take tak take up this position I'll have to offer to another person the your colleague
then the other person ni dia okay dia ambitious aku tahu it suits it suits her lah tu macam dia bukan ada
not someone yang there yet lah but pada aku macam not the
ah tak
bukan experience dia macam dia micro manage ah
abeh dia imposed macam kerja-kerja macam dia punya
dia bahasa kalau dia buat format eh
kalau aku buat format nak kena macam gini nak kena ikut tau team members semua kena ikut cara dia gitu ah dia akan check one by one kau buat kerja betul ke tidak like if you don't do it um betul-betul dia macam
dia send one email nanti dia kasi
dia buat ah step one step two step three really really micro manage punya kind of person jadi macam
aku pula bahasa agaknya aku tak teratur tak organise langsung
aku akan usually dengan budak dengan team members aku bilang dorang you do like this tapi pandai-pandai kau lah buat cara sendiri lah takde format punya benda tau dia lain dia bahasa kena ada format dia nak kena after this dot must have exclamation mark atau question mark that kind tau
very teratur very neat and tertib tulisan dia pun very tu kadang-kadang aku pun hairan macam mana dia boleh
aku totally opposite tapi boss aku cakap macam dia cakap err she will also be promoted but she will take care of the well head activities then aku take over the down hole activities so that time aku fikir err try jer lah ambil jer dulu lah that's how sekali dah take over dengan tahun ni dengan COVID ah kau sales baik dua account twenty one million ah tahun ni tak aku rasa
work wise ah work wise macam aku boleh manage ah cuma every night sekarang almost every night nak kena kerja
kena buat report
kat during the day tak there's simply not enough time mana answer customer nya email then err nanti ada quality issues lah supply chain issues logistic tak datang lah then at the same time kau kena check into inventory then check into macam housekeeping at the same time kita kena think of ways to reduce the inventory
macam-macam lah dalam satu hari one day you can like
tak boleh habis so nanti benda-benda report yang bahasa nak kena churn out data
aku buat malam kat rumah atau that time during work from home tu kan tu lagi productivity terus turun pasal siang anuh budak-budak take care of the kids punya tu
nanti aku macam takde aku tak boleh focus tau ah macam aku punya walaupun tak banyak kerja rumah aku boleh just let go tak buat apa-apa
tapi you can't macam tak boleh tau the data that you're you're doing at that point I rasa macam
takpe ah nanti I need macam quietness at the night baru aku buat ah tapi pada time malam aku dah tidurkan elly nanti aku dah energy aku dah gone that's why sometimes aku cakap telefon apa jamu nak ambil
yang deep station yang tu aku beli kan
itu aku rasa help with tangan aku that time
pasal bila lepas two months aku rasa macam takde effect aku stop tapi right after aku stop tu
about one month tu tangan aku clear tau dah tak gatal-gatal lagi tau there's a period aku remember aku jumpa liyana um she also noticed eh tangan dah baik your hand is better now
sekali one month aku tidur rumah aku start balik
so aku rasa sebab aku stop the deep station thing ke every night every morning aku consume waktu bulan puasa dengan hari raya
pasal so mana lah aku tahu buat tu ada saffron mana seh nak dapat

tapi dia punya window
panel of windows saja biasa kalau buka tingkap
habuk masuk macam luar takde apa-apa tau is like the it's like a enclosed area
in between sebelah ada lagi satu neighbour jiran sebelah kirakan they won't be able to see the
the the scenery ah kirakan window dalam rumah tu semua buka takde view langsung
it's either to a close enclosed space atau um
tu rumah about aku rasa dia build in two year two O O two

every month cuma berapa jer
tapi you need the space aku rasa pasal kau ada empat anak tau sekarang
baru lah aku nampak satu action daripada only cats
luar this is nice this is just aku suka rumah kau to me macam just nice you ada
apa tu this dining area just sebelah dengan the kitchen abeh boleh nampak aku suka aku cakap dengan ati dia cakap alah I want something cosy macam like my friend house kan ada the the layout just nice tau the kitchen tak besar macam tak cramp then the dining area is just nice
then ada enough bilik like kalau kau satu perempuan satu lelaki
aira untung ah
mm but memang logically memang she girls with hafis hmm so okay ah
dah dah dah dah separate ah the rooms
tilam tu kecil seh untuk dorang tiga-tiga
masa-masa ni lah dorang bonding biar lah

kelakar betul lah aku macam that day macam
aku sedih pun ada macam happy pun ada proud pun ada
then that then last year err last year the start err his first kononnya macam dating ah

err dia kata dia tak ada feelings already for ian
ian actually dah beli kan dia like birthday present tau he ordered
a small apa entah lah dia tunjuk aku
sekali that day I think he took it quite um dia tak badly lah tapi macam
dia macam shock ah macam tak tahu kan what what to how to what to do pasal dia everyday will will chat on the phone with the girl they don't they don't meet often
kalau meet ada kawan kau ada kawan-kawan together
um then the girl I think the err family dia very warak so seldom keluar
err and then I think she feels that macam
what for have relationship kalau macam jarang keluar she's very restricted by the family
dia sendiri kata macam I think dia macam can't be bother anymore just call it off lah
so ian okay she they started to I think the way they handle it was during the circuit breaker period what so kat rumah dia main game dia tengok dia nya YouTube dengan netflix

bismillah banyak-banyak kalau dia orang islam
dia dia tak speak melayu langsung like mixed mixed pun tidak
kita kita no no problem eh
all the way eh cakap
pasal aku rasa daripada tadi kau berbual kan ada banyak english daripada melayu

government aided nya sekolah
mm mungkin dekat dekat near the neighbourhood don't have atau takde maybe all maxed out no no space
hmm ada program activities yang tolong dorang develop certain milestones and the guide they are guided
kalau dekat rumah bibik will help to take care of them tengok-tengokkan
tapi jarang lah ada bibik yang also like
engage them with activities yang
boleh buka minda cukup tak aku punya melayu

nanti time sahur
dia cakap there dekat tempat village tu banyak rumah kosong pasal kena sihir
a'ah kan and dia orang punya sihir is like sihir sampai mati punya
then ah nanti time sahur jer nanti dia cakap you will hear she will hear a lot of things macam budak nangis lah perempuan nangis lah kan then I was like thinking
bulan puasa seh
mm so moral of the story is don't marry a turkish man gitu eh
tak ah tak sangat ah
ah serious yang mana
ada ke seh anak buat mak gila
itu dabbe lah
ya it's not the mak buat
no mak dia kahwin kira dia dua ni mak dia dua ni dia orang bukan adik-beradik tau dia orang adik tiri
ya that but they don't know that dia orang adik tiri
ah it's not that the girl yang buat it's not the kakak yang buat tau
is it not the mak yang buat dulu ke
no mak dia yang buat dulu then terus dia punya hantu dengan jin tu pergi dekat kakak dia
yang dia nya yang dia nya best friend ada affair dengan dia punya husband kan
husband dia bunuh perempuan tu because of one gambar a'ah
but husband dia padan muka lah ya
siapa suruh cheat cheat on the best friend pula tu
she seek another doctor nya help tu kan dengan tukang ubat
but then kan kau ingat yang dia pergi yang dia punya yang dia pergi dekat tempat tukang ubat tu ke yang tempat doktor tu then ada satu budak perempuan tu yang boleh nampak-nampak barang kan dia cakap yang mulut dia kena paku kena begitu like what she did to herself
ya lah because they think macam why would a
jahat person come to seek for help
ya lah ya lah
ya lah but it's already written in the quran yang kau yang there's another world ya
eh tadi aku nak tanya apa eh
oh nanti dapat dia punya hundred dollars nya tu then they cannot stack the
pasal it's not like hundred dollars dia orang just hundred dollars again tau like it's break it's break it's broken into like maybe twenty dollars aku rasa
they say macam ada satu tempat tu yang dia punya fish and chips ke burger dia sedap
bedek eh
mak dia penakut ah
I don't know I've never ride the mummy before masa tu aku rasa
was either long queue atau tengah
then that time aku naik yang jurassic park kan basah kan after that kau tahu aku pergi mana yang tea cup nya
because I dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi there was this one yang dekat tempat tak ingat lah dekat tempat mana but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree habis aku kan
habis aku kan
buat christmas tree kan dulu
so aku pergi dekat aku macam aku nak pegang-pegang sekali tiba-tiba benda tu move tu aku terkejut
tak sis mak kau
because it managed to macam scare aku ah tu aku macam
ya he was laughing pasal macam aku kan susah nak takutkan a'ah then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu
sixty something sama lah aku rasa
but one of the scariest is aku punya kawan ya tak pun yang the kak pon clan and she also looked like kak pon ah that one
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like kak pon
a'ah she is one of the ni lah kira kak pon punya scarers lah but she never entah lah dia tak cakap apa-apa pun
kan I wanted to go seh because aku rasa
yang hari tu aku pergi pun the the year before aku pergi the only thing that scared me was the
sabah dia orang macam buat sabah punya voodoo shit begitu
ya lah
dia no dia macam ah aborigine punya ni ah orang that apa tu
what is that called orang asli orang asli
it's not really macam scary
aku suka eh benda begini
sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu kan and then they were like saying yang sis huzairi ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua then suddenly dia punya kawan just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time macam
lain hari ah then ah then they were like macam apa seh engkau tiba-tiba ah then sekali I think he texted or cakap ah the next time err or like call or something aku pun tak ingat
mmhmm dia dekat situ then dia cakap ah eh dia balik ah then after that ah baru dia cakap ah tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang kan
habis ah then they say lah macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
there's no such thing as ghosts what there's only jin
I don't know ah because like macam hari tu aku tengok yang incredible tales tu kan they say their ah kong is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then a'ah for the departed then they just macam dia orang tak burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah so he went back to the house
okay but I got this one question for you habis kalau if you are poor what even can you do
it's not the worst sin lah but they believe that macam
ya lah but kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun it's not it's not a
you want to bunuh people with what seh I don't know you have don't have anything what
ya but at the point of time it's not kira dia macam you are not of sound mind tau at the point of time
ya but then that's the only kira macam that's the only sin lah kan
betul lah that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
tak juga no I mean like islam is fair because macam dia orang akan
akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau and then after that if you have your buruk and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your buruk but then after that you will be given a chance to
taubat lah that's why got
I asked this question during umrah
ya lah then that's why I say that's why that time I was in umrah then they they was talking about this lah like ah before we went to umrah we have like the course kan habis dia orang tanya lah macam okay then bila kita zaman ah this ustaz macam rock rock sikit lah habis dia cakap then bila kita zaman time zaman rock kita pun terlepas solat then dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat lah solat taubat then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back macam qada because you know you don't know how many
how would I know siapa kita nak judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga just because dia kasi air dekat anjing tu so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to pertikaikan kita punya amalan
kalau aku pun aku bunuh sia aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa
but he already bunuh the ustaz
ya lah that's why kan aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting sis kan aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki ah tapi dah maki lah tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda word this word is for another word but actually kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu
mm maki jer
that's why macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah plus point dah malaikat dah tulis dah oh dia nak solat ah dia terus nak pergi tak oh tak dia tak pergi tapi tak minus tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya ya then if kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak oh nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai lah orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu and dia buat jahat then baru dia orang tulis
it makes it macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam because
like orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya sister sister nak sembahyang pun sister nak solat kita buat jer yang wajib
doesn't mean like you don't wear your tudung your amalan is lesser than
yang spaghetti bolognese punya hook tu aku cakap apa tu yang
lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that aku ni ah aku ni perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people lah
oh sis lagi kena teruk everytime I wear tudung then people all like macam cakap aku ni macam-macam
it's not about step good good ah dia macam macam ah alah perempuan tudung ni semua you know the guys that I like get to know right they say macam perempuan tudung ni
actually senang jer
macam kira senang dapat ah
it doesn't matter lah I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just apa kita
like I think those kind of things so so macam
mengghairahkan and
siapa nurul
the cantik one
she what her display picture ah yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab
no I mean like macam you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
tak ah sis more aware ah
but how to makan ah with niqab so you just open like that then makan I mean like ya ya lah
ya but then macam that's how people see you as a hijabi ah so when kau macam jatuhkan judgement dekat niqabi when orang jatuhkan judgement as
dekat kau as a hijabi then kau macam tak boleh terima
but actually macam betul lah cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
ilmu lah kenapa kau nak pakai niqab so engkau punya journey
so macam kau punya journey tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu
dia macam there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
tapi macam okay speaking of this eh I was like thinking tau masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam very ah small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and dia orang punya tulang is very small so like
not say macam fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then macam bila aku pakai eh aku rasa macam then I was saying this to nek yam you know then I was like macam eh habis nanti orang pakai habis macam
you know all these people macam pakai macam terletak jer then macam for me is like terletak and then tiba-tiba macam shoulder besar
and shoulder besar and then like then macam tergantung ah macam tergantung kita macam hanger so it's like it's not nice ah pada aku then after that nek yam said something that macam terus macam aku terus ugh
macam then she say you wear things you want to wear a niqab you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of allah
sis terus shut up lah
ya lah but doesn't mean kau presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just macam kau tak boleh change diri engkau
dapat sis looking at her
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time macam she became a basic
but then macam but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly ringarde lah
in dunia lah mmhmm
tapi macam kalau kau dah actually kau pakai hijab jer kau dah kena sacrifice all these things seh slowly lah
alin terima kasih datang nak buat project ini dengan aku

nanti aku ajak I think I will ask my nephew my cousins these two
we're not into gold yet no no no we're not the makcik makcik who likes wearing gold
I think today there's really not much to talk about lah because macam
there was a lecture online today tu jer ah
talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
but dia datang lambat
really really kau asyik datang sekolah lambat seh
no but the previous semester usually kau on time for school
speaking of attendance kau tahu aku that time dapat email dari sekolah cakap
just masalah ni like macam
okay K this is err out of topic but like you know leh ni tak tahu siapa asyik reply aku punya tak eh reply aku punya pula always like replying to my instagram stories
yes yes you know this person and dia ah sama course dengan kita masa I think sekarang pun sama lah
mm boleh can
ya Q asyik reply to my eh why do I keep saying reply to my apa tu lah reply to my ah instagram story
but it when he reply right it's always the randomness things macam for example if
and then he will wah tempat ni kat mana seh
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
ini playground aku
apasal dengan budak ni ah maybe
ya and then but tapi recently kan
so dia macam tanya eh this week intern apa eh this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
oh and then err I will reply ah this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern
then I will reply the same thing we twenty one but then I don't want to tanya lah you don't have any classmate meh macam offensive seh
tak tak tak uh this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after
but but dia but he got message you on instagram what that time kau tunjuk aku
no lah I'm I'm not overthinking about it and I I don't like to fikir banyak sangat about this pasal anyways if
if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive kan
dia tahu pe aku ada mata air so why would he even try
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly I am the most boring person in the world and I aku tak suka social interaction
kalau if
stop it and then and then ah he asked me that this is like tengah malam so like twelve midnight
but then I was so lazy so malas to like look up the thing cause I was already in bed macam nak tidur
I told him that and then he is like oh okay tak apa dah jumpa
and I okay you just wasted my time and then he started to move on pasal
uh apa tu about what's my and everything then and
he actually pandai seh his is three point two you know
and then ah I see wah your cumulative is so good then he ask me your intern kau dapat A ah then I say
ya I get A what about you and then dia cakap dia dapat B can't believe he dapat B actually kan that time I berbual with captain ho dia cakap most of the boys dapat B meanwhile the girls get A
aiya whatever lah it's over already anyways your tinggi pe so like there's nothing to
risaukan ya
then he said alah university kalau university pun uh he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it ee
K K kau suka dia
tapi but we are the same height what
ah ya ya can you please tell me what happened I want to know nak tahu
notice apa why ah why leh
huh siapa yang reject kau sia I mean you're like damn pretty
aku feel so betrayed
jauh pe orchard is so far
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau dah nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
I think I think you kau ada cakap telegram oh
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
actually ah I have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together lah so sejak kecil until besar
tapi kan the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
eh no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like secucuk for you lah
adik-adik ya stop it sia
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu ah yang I can recommend to you
no I I told you what he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like I kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so mm
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
ya I faham I faham
but that kind of person susah nak cari seh because like nowadays guys are just
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
actually uh after the truth or dare game right I thought dia
tak suka aku because like I feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
then I am like wasn't the tak oh is he not at me
ya lah tu
huh I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia seh ya
yes yes there was the story then ah you know then after that I teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch lah and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh I think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then ah kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then eh his ex nampak lah then
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up lah
ah aku just tak suka when like uh apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan I mean just make it clear lah that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air sia
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because I don't even know who he is so
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
like kau orang are just platonic friends lah
the mata air dia just have issues lah I think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan yasmin
I don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look ah the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah lah
speaking of the office you know my sister ah I told my kakak about uh all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then uh dia akan uh bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should err the office two point O
aku is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
ah after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person lah and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku seh this one you pass back to err si logistics dulu then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau pe
mm it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
um I I get what you mean though because macam oh at
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID kita kena work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and then oh and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
mm I mean ah almost hari-hari kan my boss will tanya everyone oh what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
um kim yam road nak pergi sengkang okay lah and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit oh my goodness
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so huh
wah so jangan lah
is it jannah dari mata air
kau tak eh
who who who do you have in mind to be jannah mata air
honestly I cannot wait until jannah kahwin though because like
I will feel so happy for her macam yes
any guy yang dapat jannah is a very very lucky guy
no because you kau tahu pe I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like I don't think jannah will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have ah girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew jannah tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
kan saya ni like shaza really shaza pula jap I mean you deserve the best also but jannah also like deserves the best
it's so merepek
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
orang dekat dia orang like oh have you registered to vote
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
especially kat singapore
woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers
it like it's macam
are you guys have to be woke in order to like macam so you guys don't ah offend siapa-siapa I'm like ugh stop it stop it
macam no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
uh actually women dia orang minta for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time ah seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence ah this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind
nak you pergi terancung
actually for my malay aku dapat A two no but there was only after I retake the malay paper
at first the aku dapat B three
mari lah
belajar otak you still got into so it
tak made a difference many ways was like the two best years of my studying life
and aku don't regret at all
and like it's just so lepak
ya I just miss so much and the lecturers actually do give a damn about you and your welfare not just kau punya studies
um ini apa
most of us tak suka miss judy because she was like so naggy for some reason she was so naggy
I remember ah the time yang bila kita baru dapat result for which company kita dapat for intern and then I didn't get lots but and I was so sad
so miss judy got me out of the lecture theatre and dia just she just tanya me ah apa jadi lah then why why asal I'm crying
I said I didn't get the companies that I wanted to and then she just no it's okay takpe I mean she been didn't say takpe but like it's okay
cederakan diri lah
ketabahan is like her macam patience
add to a certain extent lah that cause kau kan perempuan
you macam shiok seh tiba-tiba
it's I yang bilang
kau takde tissue that time
but but that blood was because you were you were scolding this lelaki yang tengah buang sampah sembarangan kan
she betul-betul seh
just route lain
how come I tak tahu it was a fake story
why your cats like so kasar like that if you train them
oh my god mister alan is just so comel you know
mister mister alan ada snapchat
best gila just shiok you know
eh aku tak sabar to get of the country like it's been so long already since we've been like at home and like just in singapore I'm so I'm really getting bored nowadays
ya then after that they say I don't know I actually didn't read the news so much ah but then nampak macam dorang nak buka like give us masuk like kasi kita masuk tapi macam they just I don't know what I don't know what was what happened ah because I don't really read the berita right but I was like
I mean because no no no dorang dah tutup
for like apa berapa bulan dah so like ya I mean I think ever since like the COVID really boom so much right I think they actually um close it already so like
eh betul ke
sekarang are you sure
jap for real ah
okay I guess I guess that's why I don't know because I mean aku baru kerja masa tu kan always night shift mana ada nak siapa sempat tak lah syafiq kyle not my aku dah aku dah dah sebab tak ada kan because of this COVID dah tak ada drama kan so macam dah
apa what the heck
jap so jap but did you know which one is it because I just know there's like zul ariffin
zul ariffin eh um I think I think he there was ah because you know because of COVID kan dorang tak ada buat drama baru kan like now they are in
sedih pe
okay ah but I never cause because of because of okay not really because of COVID but like a few since like a few years ago kan then I already like because of apa friends punya apa-apa nama dia I I guess influence macam gitu they be like K drama K drama K drama ya that's so
aku eh no I feel like
I mean you got to watch the drama first then after that you will be in love dengan character dia pe
lah cerita lama tak best I mean I don't really watch all cerita lama but I watch lah like at um a few years ago punya kan
I watch like macam
I swear every time he macam oh I don't know what to watch goblin and I'm like bro are you
weh boring pe tu aku tak boleh okay no matter how good a show is right I will never re-watch uh not that I'll never re-watch sebab I wouldn't go until six times three four times
but ya lah because you know after I mean I can lah because you know after watching a show right you can actually macam like you know I don't know about you ah but for me after watching a show or like when I watch this show I feel very attached to the show
boring pe aku tak boleh dok macam tu
wah okay that's is that's a new thing for me like macam a new information of someone
actually now that I think about it aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like macam all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america eh not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last one endgame so I only like I only like apa saw that big big one are the main main shows lah I don't really watch the specific um only
ya like you know got the batman lah all that different different one right so I don't really watch yang macam tu
wah but eh but you know because of COVID also right aku this year aku binge watch banyak gila korean drama
okay jap aku okay first aku tengok doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic kan so it's like macam um is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously ada that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then um I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite I mean for the ones that I have seen I think kirakan about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay ah ya to me ah so I watched the doctor romantic first lah yang first tu so it was that that show is about apa banyak doctor doctor punya scene ah so it's like banyak so jadi punya tempat punya scene wah you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like eh can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery punya punya apa nama dia what do you call it uh surgery punya
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama punya they are so tip top bro
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors pakai oh my god cantik
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same tau like as in like but it's just that why can't it why macam just macam tak sama tau aku aku pun macam
ya so I was like shit okay so dia cakap ada hotel bloom I'm like sabar am I am I suppose to wait for it macam happen like
so dia macam tak ada tak ada
ada lah yang kan aku ada buat aku tengok doctor romantic two dia ada dua dua
I mean maybe not so because kadang-kadang orang nak kan people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama eh dia banyak international fans tau
banyak gila international fans
eh even suria dorang tunjuk tau aku macam
ya ya you know cerita um my is gangnam beauty
eh park seo joon eh bro my is gangnam beauty yang
ya but it's that apa cerita pun dekat suria then I was like sabar
itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka but I think I remember dulu bila back then also selalu tengok because selalu bila kecil-kecil kan mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada box kan you know the android box that kind of thing
dulu mana ada benda tu semua kan like macam
ya so there's always a singapore nya channel so dah tengok singapore nya channel tu kan kadang-kadang like main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya button tu semua kan so kita tengok ah like some of it macam all the apa nama dia channel one is it yang all that dub basically that thing lah
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember ah when I first like came upon on that that apa channel lah aku macam apa benda sia ni
I think ya oh my god okay even aku rasa even kalau dorang kalau park seo joon cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka
but ya I cannot lah watch that kind of show I just need the original punya
ya but honestly for me also kan kalau tengok um subtitle dengan drama at the same time macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga ah sebab you know you wanna
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm uh is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because kadang-kadang
aku dengar jer kan
kan sama sama
but then but then you know sometimes kalau macam I mean not not um not korean drama also like like anything ah because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like macam make faces so is like macam if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then macam you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I tak faham
oh no the the translation the translation is like very macam so formal right the word
yo same ah same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix aku tengok malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like whoa what are saying translation ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham seh
tapi like kalau kalau apa malay drama pun kadang-kadang dorang guna all the peribahasa ke or like the
like kalau okay singapore nya tak sangat ah singapore nya
oh my god I love anak metropolitan
youths okay ya so oh my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so gerek
ya but if I'm not wrong anak metropolitan actually ada dua dua season kan dua ke tiga season but the one yang dorang tunjuk kat youtube sebab if I'm not wrong sekarang youtube ada then me watch pun ada tapi aku tak tengok ah dulu kan toggle kan I think toggle pun ada ah but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly ah cause like kirakan dorang punya platform I don't think is that is that apa nama dia friendly is it
then kadang-kadang dorang load lama tau like as in like you know macam kalau nak masuk go inside the app then it will like load quite long to actually show you the page show you the ya
ah ya memang memang macam tu because that time aku kat malaysia then aku nak tengok viu tau then aku tak boleh tengok sebab I'm not in singapore
I guess I guess so that's why macam aku tak boleh tengok so I was like geram ah macam shit aku aku ingatkan aku kat malaysia aku boleh tengok so I'm like ah sedihnya tak boleh tengok because because benda tu kan because benda tu kan tak boleh tak boleh uh jumpa mana-mana sangat kan so I was like a bit sad ah gitu lagipun macam I thought holiday holiday pun I still got time to watch apa drama kan
ya so macam sedih ah
I guess it's not really holiday it's not really holiday a holiday ah sebab aku kan kat rumah kan macam eh sorry not kat rumah aku kan kat rumah cousin aku aku ada cousin yang tinggal kat malaysia so I go there ah everytime kalau nak gi malaysia selalu singgah sana so that's why ingatkan dah kat sana dah ada wi-fi semua then I'm like shit
ya bro ya I mean see because of COVID mana kita boleh pergi malaysia dok what the heck
ada ah tapi macam just macam isi minyak pastu like beli makan sekejap pastu balik you know that kind of thing so it's not like you go there and like staycation eh eh sorry
huh oh aku tak pernah dok pakai train uh pergi
kau bedek ah five minutes
siak okay from here to aku faham ah tapi it's from woodlands kan
abeh kau apa kat dalam kereta kau just tengok
kau punya phone
eh then they should start making at dok
ya ya ya memang memang eh kapal terbang kot kau bro aeroplane how slow can the aeroplane go
aku actually pergi tu aku um in my whole entire life aku jarang pergi just for leisure
I get no no no because um kirakan selalu aku kan cousin aku tinggal kat seremban kan so aku selalu gi seremban no seremban is like you know um johor then I think melaka then after that seremban
ya you know okay I tell you the furthest from here that means the furthest um country in malaysia is perlis is perlis so right apa um uh is perlis so perlis is near thailand so it's like aku selalu pergi sana sebab aku ada cousin kat sana juga ah not cousin ah but more of like makcik pakcik yang tinggal kat sana cause uh arwah atuk aku dia punya family semua dekat perlis then after that I go there ah sometimes right so um I got this place ah got the padang besar padang besar is like the big ass shopping area kat kat perlis so when you go there right you literally see the border of thailand
ya ya ya ya ya you can literally you can literally see the gate entry of thailand kat apa padang besar tu tau then aku macam sebab that time aku bila aku pergi ah first time aku pergi padang besar tu kan then aku tengok ah aku macam because I was thinking the I think car lah cause kat sana tak boleh it's too packed to take the uh uh apa bus so um I took the car ah abeh lepas tu aku nampak ah
naik sebab aku pergi dengan my cousins and my pakcik makcik ah so it's like banyak orang kan so kita naik bus jadi dah naik bus tu um dari sana dari from singapore kita naik bus till like till like perlis or till like half way through then kita change another bus to um perlis so from perlis kita dah ada kita punya all the makcik pakcik kan so kita just pinjam kereta ah kita kita gi jalan-jalan kat itu so dah pergi padang besar tu aku first nampak aku macam why is this why is there macam apa like thailand punya wordings eh kat sini eh macam what
ya so I was like so so I tanya ah
is that close bro that's why from singapore actually right we can go straight I don't know whether we can go whether we can actually go by car until england kalau tak salah
ya ya ya so so so that means from thailand then after that kalau kau pergi atas lagi then you will be connected to another country lepas tu kau boleh pergi to another country then kau boleh ya ya ya so until england kalau tak salah yang paling yang paling
yang paling jauh ah yang kau boleh pergi ah
ah motor okay ah sebab motor dua-dua orang jer kan so like
right oh my god so it's like you can actually just kirakan ah what is it called uh
you know I wanted to do backpacking cause like macam why not right
but then it's budget ah you cause dah bikin
but backpacking selalu
itu backpacking nama dia
it's I thought backpacking selalunya ah maybe I don't know what's the meaning
I guess no because I thought backpacking is like apa memang bawa minimal barang abeh lepas itu
gi oh my god walking eh
wow just gila aku tak tahu siapa yang sanggup jalan kaki from here to
tu macam apa tau tu macam dah apa uh berapa ribu tahun lepas
weh oh my god jauh though
ya dok even from here to jurong east aku tak boleh dok
I mean tak boleh lah cuma macam the thing the the
bukan tak kind of macam malas gila ah nak jalan ah
that's why so I'm like what the because you know kan aku dulu sekolah dekat jurong east kan so macam like macam I kadang-kadang kan kalau terlupa bus pass ke apa then macam nak kena balik sekolah
itu pasal lah kau ingat eh apa aku dah penat-penat apa pergi sekolah apa aku dah penat-penat sekolah then aku nak kena jalan balik rumah oh my god that will be like so tiring sia dengan bag sebab dulu bila kecil-kecil selalu um bawa bag berat-berat kan so macam I don't why though huh
no wonder I was like because that time you told us about you were walking at like jurong lake gardens aku macam
aku ingatkan kau actually apa nama dia kau walk just within the
ya ya and like within within jurong lake garden jer tu pasal aku macam okay lah apa-apa yang
jap siapa punya idea ni
science garden science centre ada park kat belakang
actually kau jalan macam jauh jer
but then bila kau jalan kat reservoir macam jauh tau
asal kau pergi jauh-jauh eh sebab dari sini sebab kalau naik bas ah kau dari sini kau boleh apa I mean that is a bit
then why you have to go science centre bagai
for real ah sebab actually from here kalau kau naik bas ah kau boleh naik I think naik bas tiga puluh kat sini abeh kau stop somewhere near taman jurong abeh lepas tu nanti
ya lah ya lah I mean that's why I was like wondering asal sampai science centre sebab from here but
so it's like ya taman jurong so I'm like dari situ then boleh jalan pe that's why I was like science centre asal seh
ye lah semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau confident sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau eh kau cakap kau dah sampai
ya I mean kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun eh kita semua dah berapa tahun obviously we have to be like independent
wah you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like macam okay so dah nak dekat kiamat kan so like why not I apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap kan kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat madinah ke makkah ke kau tak kan jumpa dengan dajjal kan so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when uh one thing yang aku tak tahu is that dorang cakap that apa nama dia even even orang yang duduk kat makkah dengan madinah um
no no no you dajjal can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the apa malaikat ah so like macam but then the thing is within makkah and madinah there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami tau
in in the end of times ah so there will be so uh because of that tsunami or earthquake it will keluarkan orang-orang yang
beriman gitu ah
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in itu so yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri they will keluar
dorang akan stay inside so that's why yang so that's why I was like thinking abeh kalau macam tu kalau in the end of times kalau aku pergi sana juga then what's the point though sebab because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore kau mana ada experience tsunami or earthquake pun kan
ya you know you know that time aku pernah pergi japan dengan sekolah aku pergi sana for school trip lah kan so then lepas itu aku
oh itu pun
ah australia dorang apa afini uh apa eh tak bukan atikah ella dengan alia dorang pergi melbourne so aku pergi japan dengan puteri dengan ifa so aku pergi sana then lepas tu um kan you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big apa gitu kan so
ya so kita uh yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi hiroshima dengan aku pergi osaka
yes history all that so dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal history kan so dah alang-alang belajar history kita nak kena belajar lah pasal we went to this macam ambulance place eh not ambulance macam fire place gitu to like learn about macam ways to like save yourself from like apa
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually ah we did a earthquake punya simulation
bro kau tahu sebab dia ada stages tau bila that simulation kan aku pergi we all had to take turns going ah I try ah because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself ah just anything to protect yourself
so aku pergi sana aku macam so there's like different different um
apa ya
ya so it's like uh they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us uh yang medium or towards the high a bit just to rasa rasa kan
it's just the tip of the iceberg ah you think just a bit ah gitu kan
it's not the worst ah it's not the level seven ah it's like level four or five gitu ah dia kasi kita try kan kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar siol it's really it's really like bergegar like macam I can't even like
jap so kalau kita
jap okay so kalau kita tengah earthquake ni kan kita boleh masuk sini tak
tak as in like as in like it's not a good place right sebab benda ni kan
right so like macam
kat bawa jer kan but then jatuh juga so like
tak dorang cakap kan because kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk cover kan
ah kau kau guna anything to cover yourself just to like macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau
ya ya ya so because kau punya head yang paling important pe dia yang dia yang control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why ah macam apa nama dia um they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like macam wooden ke apa ke as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
ya oh my god that one sedih juga though kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi I mean okay tapi kau punya kaki dah
ah and like kalau dah penyek kau confirm nak kena amputate
ah itu itu lama gila
ya so that's why a bit scary ah gitu kan
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic lah but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is apa kirakan it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well lah like sekarang
singapore actually dapat
it's good that kita kecil ah cause kalau kita kalau kita besar confirm tak boleh control ah sebab
hmm lagi nasib baik kat singapore ada banyak quite a number of uh hospital kan and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think ada quite a number at least at least two ah ya then now cause sekarang they are all starting to built community hospital
if I'm not mistaken community hospital yang all the firstly is all the very minor minor punya sickness ah are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing lah
and it's also for people yang from the major hospital transfer to
I mean ng teng fong ada community hospital
ya so that's why so sekarang dorang dah buat community hospital kat sini so I guess if I'm not that time aku pergi
mana eh woodlands ke east side east side or north side aku pergi aku pun nampak they are like trying to built something then it looks like macam community hospital also dari luar ah sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok renovation kan then nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu kan
so like you can see like all the you know like kalau for houses I don't know if you know ah but for houses kan nanti they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then kalau for hospital they would show hospital punya itu ya so macam from the outside we can
I kind of saw like macam that that thing lah so I was like oh I guess because kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah
I mean is sekarang banyak gila foreigner datang sini seh like banyak gila
actually sekarang
wait so bapa kau masih kat sana
alah sedihnya sorang-sorang
oil abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa
ah tapi kalau oil but he's not really in contact with oil lah right he's just like
I mean baju dia kau dah cuci actually that time kan bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja airline kan so dia pun nak kena fix fix all the aeroplane punya stuff right
ah ya it's time kerja cause dia cakap dia balik rumah then dia nak kena tukar baju because apa dia terjatuh oil ya then I was like I was like shit apa bau sia ni
it so strong macam toxic
ya but then actually kalau kau pergi I don't for you but for me aku kalau pergi what is it called petrol station aku suka bau dia
low-key tapi aku macam
ya so but then that time apa dia kena kat dia punya baju kan so baju obviously aku rasa dah in contact with the skin gitu ah
ya so it's like dia dah mandi kan then dia dia dia tanya aku ah eh ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi eh
dia macam ah there's one application that I tried is ah mystery shopper
so then they pay you upfront ke or they
that means doing the pharmacy punya side lah but the problem is I have to
I can only work until december but then dia orang cakap cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the uh apa ni we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
mm tapi dekat jems kau
ya I can actually kerja dekat uh sana kan if they can ini but then too bad
that's why then another one I tried is uh apa ni
but that one is uh apa ni that one pun uh ada shift ah seven to
even uh temperature taking also they ask you to apa ni they will ask you to commit for at least
tapi dormitories is very risky because
no because sometimes it's up to the apa tu management to
tapi nanti dia last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before lah macam like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully tak ada change
tapi kalau ada change then susah lah how am I going to call the ini kan the other job
correct that's why I think my colleague kan dia tak nak she doesn't want to do this uh macam because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
ya she requested for a full time tapi bagus kau dia punya because of
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these ah tapi because of dia punya qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's dia dia pun I think on work pass eh
mm because we cannot my current employer dia cakap if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal lah but so just log in apa
it will I think there's some law thingy ah and then kesian kan all these uh
passes holder like because what they are thinking is dia orang nak save on rental
ah then down there tak ada imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
kesian seh
because dia cakap that time kan ah during the COVID period then all these malaysian tak boleh balik
the father passed away a few years back lah so he staying the whole house alone and then dia cakap ah he advertise on gumtree um
apa ni dia cakap ada all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
with aircon and with uh that's it tak keluar pun and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas si azman ni pula uh dia kerja
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself tak kecoh-kecoh you know
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how dia cakap cooking because all male
uh I think five room also ah dekat woodlands
tu dia cakap uh because his pay was uh cut I think about thirty percent eh thirty
thirty percent ke forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he kena cut
but I guess it's okay lah because he's a guy abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik unlike macam perempuan kan suka keluar
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle lah macam ada job ada job tak ada job tak ada job anyway I have extra income
tak boleh order tak boleh keluar makan I mean like once in a while
so that's why then what about your side your company okay tak
those who are urgently need to balik kampung or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
are mostly macam like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya resume apa semua then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
ya I guess tapi ten K eh
she said she rented one condo dekat uh harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
tapi bila sometimes ah when it comes to their private travel ah wah then the the wife can be bossy
that's why sometimes I hear complain from ah macam
ah I also got one experience because apa ni dia punya secretary punya boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then ah uh every year they have this uh macam trip home trip lah so call home leave
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves um so if they don't use and then just rugi lah it's like forfeited
then lepas tu kan nanti along the way there will be changes of course
uh apa ni kenapa deduct eh I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so dia cakap uh did he upgrade or any he asked me to check dia kata bila krisflyer actually deduct salah or what
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything uh we didn't do any claim lah check punya check rupanya wife dia
aku tanya dia uh apa ni so the
ya funny right can you imagine he sekali ah he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what sekali ah the
dia punya wife claim everything siao
ah every time like that nanti karang uh apa tu you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to macam-macam lah
ya because the fare pun if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that uh got no rule ah macam
yes lepas tu the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes dia bising
susah seh but you never know what sometimes ah last minute changes or last minute nak kena pergi sana pergi sini
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't ini
remember that time yang kau punya si ex
terbalik right
aiya for actually for them ah definitely they want to they will apa ni push push to somebody what
book lepas tu tak check and then just give
baru dia cakap don't don't repeat the same mistake
ni apa flight actually you take
no I think it's expensive pasal ah it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
actually ho chin minh ada banyak flight apa vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
other than that ada budget airlines
of course it's not funny lah you crazy macam I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
tak messy sangat pasal kan if you were to do like that ah macam like
macam departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date tau dia bukan macam
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling ah it's very messy so you have to see macam
aku cuma ambil yang departure on the saturday
tak pasal the different website got different allotment why sometimes ah like macam ah agoda they got ten ten room
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked tapi bila you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
tapi actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
tapi okay ah because okay lah macam let's say it's individual booking
I'm sure they have their own bilik tau
nanti they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you tak from this company this company ah so it's easier
I think it's china hong kong tak payah visa
tapi kalau china visa ah
ah apa tu passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
ah you can still it depends ah tapi
kalau if they are travelling around asia pac ah you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
cuma kalau dia declare as tourists then they don't need
tapi tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you lah
but luckily tak payah I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia jump
it's just the you know dia punya screw dia terpleot
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover tapi
the company is like neither here nor there kalau kau apply for a job and let's say you get a job
susah lah
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin punya tu is under recruitment agency no harm just go lah anyway they just want to collect data what
then berbual dengan kau lah pasal pasal tadi punya kes
he came with the father because he's below twenty one so you know in a way dia macam bapa dia kena sign the contract lah eh sign the paper ya
dia tak nak dia tak nak buka mulut dia so lepas dia abeh lepas tu bila part doctor nak letak macam ubat err sebal kan dia tak kasi dia tutup jer mulut dia all the way sampai bapa dia marah dia
then lepas itu dia macam then he cried like literally he cried he's already nervous after that her his went down to went up to around hundred hundred over plus hundred forty
tapi bapa dia bapa dia macam marah marah dia but then we kita cakap dengan bapa dia lah actually kalau the like normal person sendiri takut so he have to macam he have to understand lah okay encourage dia yang dia uh this is gonna be a you know macam it's gonna be a it's like something new for him also you know
ah siot kita ada lagi lima puluh lapan minit nak kena berbual
nak kena buat apa eh eh then how how's your leave what you do
eh how about we go hiking kat labrador ah
eh you have you go to there's this one area right yang um tempat dia kan there's a uh ada macam kolam ikan tau
this one tak boleh naik kan the hutan

mm plus eh tak payah tak payah tak tak
it's like apa tu what they say is it investment
like the higher rank one they they do that macam they they buy a condo because their pay is already high what so they they buy a condo
apa ni ya
I think they see also lah macam what kind of like background
family members support also you know macam like they like oh okay lah I got this amount like I
boleh tak start balik
okay I have a friend in in lah so macam they are they are brought up in a very err
ya so like macam
so like macam most of them um
they want to like go to like macam apa ni
so like macam wah like very interesting like they have they know that it's already like fixed you know
so I like wah so so lucky then like they like very chim know then like macam
susah sangat eh
ya if if they want if I mean like if they want to macam
work in a line where requires like or masters then okay lah but then I feel like macam
the type of work or like macam what you want to do
so it's like more of like macam
he was like uh telling me afiq actually kan um degree tak tak perlu sangat lah macam like if you want you want lah I mean like
huh my my senior ah my senior dia cakap actually at first also I want to take degree then bila fikir balik macam
um waste uh not not not say waste of time lah macam like you you need more money what to pay you school bills and all
apa tu enhance or like
like he can just like get in already because of the experience that he get macam like his
ya so first half is um local then macam I think around four months lah four months is overseas
so I got a double cert macam
like uh apa apa apa apa lah
in half a year and usually like that kind of thing take like macam a few years or like macam in one year ah
tunda lah kahwin ho then dapat anak dah empat puluh
chey sedih seh tu tak lah
no lah it won't this one ya tiga puluh
eh lelaki dengan perempuan masalah tau
ya eh really I mean like macam okay for for the girls eh
I mean like of course like we as guys like we want anak or what
then imagine kalau like you know that you can't um produce anak
then like it's another thing then you feel like macam
family tree ya ya zuriat wow
I wanted to say zakat zakat different thing sia
imagine if like your jodoh is like a older like for me eh a guy my jodoh is a older girl
or females is more like macam I feel that uh like girls kan macam like now the this like our generation kan
but I feel that now like macam they want to
unless ya unless your pay is like macam ada commission that kind
macam not
so that's why you need to have a back up ah macam like
satu ribu tu like for the longest time
ah then your the one that you saved up confirm [dah] makin lesser what
like a heads up eh macam now people start to think oh I need a like a back up plan I need savings that kind of thing
unless your company have like macam monthly pay cause uh ya cause like
um one of my friend uh apa ni
err dia kerja events so like monthly she got like a fixed pay of like two point five
uh apa ni she
um jobs ah macam like ada commissions so macam they give a lot of like commission things tau so she need to do a lot of like
so macam she will take in the other
uh person punya slot
so like okay let's say like macam you you already have a thing to do
then after that but still the commission will like the double commission tu will like
ya so so like macam it will add up lah it will add up to one commission in the end but then that commission can like
macam whatever they sell they will get like a few percent of it
gila kan
ya lah she untung lah
two no not cawangan err
so that this group will do some of this group punya work then this group will do like ya
crazy lah so macam like
ya but then of course the the shit that they go through like banyak masalah lah ya
ah sembarang ambil
uh got lah got but then um macam if you need to work
you really need to macam you need to put your work first like that
instead of like family of what which is the point like my friend macam
at a point of time she give up she wanted to like macam just um quit
so like macam
ya but you really need to stand for your right lah even though macam that pay is good ke apa kan but you must know your
so that the their apa ni the one that will take over them
ah dia orang punya anak will not have
so that macam like in like some people have like emergency money what
oh at that time uh they have a saving so they were sharing with me lah and my family macam they have a saving
uh okay their emergency is like so weird it's like macam okay emergency like wedding
like dia punya anak wedding
exactly macam okay like let's say macam
err last minute um the the anak couldn't pay for certain things kan
err then macam they need to help out in a way like that kind of like emergency lah
ah macam like those those small things macam like maybe uh venue
ah macam like
not it bukan bukan lupa bukan lupa but then she couldn't pay
because she's okay her ikat tunang
ah ah that one I don't know ah okay dia punya ikat tunang is two years
so I think she like macam want to get uh married lah already lah macam more earlier so they push like one year plus
then the mum was like think like saying are you sure I feel do you have like enough saving already then she say err nevermind lah buat simple simple
so like everything was like tergantung then the mum keep asking have you paid have you paid have you do this have you do that then she said oh ya ya ah later lah later lah then
but her side is already then she like macam
take it very lightly so I was like thinking kau nak kahwin ke tak nak kahwin ni kau serious ke tak serious ni
then I mean like if you want simple then just like nikah then makan sikit-sikit ah this one she do like a sanding sanding
then like got this and that I mean like macam okay the the quality is not as like
you know this girl ah she everything she tangguh tangguh tangguh then after that
cannot take it already the mum like there's no updates or anything then the mak ask her
then she like err ya actually ni nak kena bayar lagi berapa ribu gini then the mum like
then the mum the mak don't want to say like she got money to help
then her mum actually um help out lah in a way like macam a few percent of the
ya only like maybe like nikah lah
I think it's a that's what like every parents want nak ah ya because like even my mum also like
uh don't want lah we make uh some some somewhere that is like macam bigger ke apa lah
then like if more bigger means more money then she said err tak apa lah err I mean like
I can help you to help you like settle this or that then like of course my brother is like the first child so he don't want to like macam burden my mum
so but then my mum wants it so like macam
dia dilemma lah whether to do or not when she said then then the girlfriend um ya the girlfriend also like
said thinking like macam
uh tak apa lah kita buat simple simple you know gini gini but then like my mum want it to be like
um sempurna lah in a way looks good like people side
ya so like macam but the family is quite small
so okay so like macam not a lot from her side then from my brother side my brother really thought was like okay I will invite like less err he will be inviting like less than a thousand of people

abeh azrul boleh ah
azrul selalu keluar I remember
ya dia fresh pass pun eh aku nampak ada P plate kat kereta dia

technically I'm the last azlan still haven't get license nor will he ever get knowing knowing dia punya pace macam gitu

surrounding dia punya vehicle
apa dia merepek eh
eh but kau kereta kau kereta pula motor kau lawa though
that's the one that aku nak
rental rental pun at least kalau dia keep paying if he can afford
that duke tu what or what
itu rental juga atau beli
motor apa seh
is that macam punya
kawan kak yin siapa sia
nadia punya is that one meh
apa racer
oh very dia lah very dengan kind macam gini eh
yes dia pun macam macam rumi juga a bit lah
it's just the pelik for me
I don't know ah dia macam
I think dia dah gonna get
engaged eh ke kahwin tak tahu lah cause dia I don't know aku selalu nampak dia on Instagram dengan this one indo girl
in the video I think I got hear before dia berbual indo macam indo punya kind
so that time dia dengan dorothy together
and then dia punya Instagram is still dia dengan perempuan tu
I don't know eh but dorothy punya Instagram is different dorothy dengan dia
so I don't know ah apa
what kind of three way ke apa binatang it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird pelik also
then that time yang aku pergi tengok thai punya performance kat monti
then kita invite rumi also lah cause rumi cakap dia nak tengok like um drag performance those nya kind
and then banyak-banyak then
tertiba dia macam tak ada girlfriend
dia dia cakap dia single cause
know thai punya friends those gay friends keep asking ah like apa tu oh ah where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what dorang macam nak menggatal kan then macam like
oh no lah I'm single and some more dia tengah in ke apa
but then dia punya Instagram masih ada the indo girl tu
and then just damn pelik ah sia and he host around with anything that moves
aku pun tak tahu aku just don't know lah
but I know zul tak comfortable dengan rumi also
zul pun petty nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap like I don't want to talk to rumi cause he never wish me happy birthday
macam apa kau merepek eh
ya apparently then aku macam
girl kalau aku lupa nak wish kau macam mana eh how ah and was like I probably won't talk to you ah
I tak faham
aku just tak faham I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday dia macam like dia cakap birthday is important what it's once a year what so hard
then aku cakap like if you're not
ah aku tak faham ah
but zul know I know zul um tak comfortable cause of tu ah
um rumi I think rumi macam menggatal dengan dia also
unfortunately for his case lah but I think that time zul was with dylan dengan mata air dia ah
ya and then dia cakap like rumi eh rumi uncomfortable and then macam
kalau I know we are all closed kita very touchy also cause we hug a lot ni semua then
dia cakap rumi rumi does that ah but rumi macam
it's kau
macam gitu jer ah
but rumi I've always seen as that way cause first time aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu
kita semua minum pe together at sticky fingers
but I like to see dia punya Instagram cause dia selalu pergi merayap makan and he eats good food
kat tempat the weirdest place
ya and dia ada motor I think
I think dia ada motor vespa
vespa dia macam ada shield macam that big ass shield kat depan
dia very gitu lah macam indie macam dia nak stand out from the rest
dia macam dia kind of mainstream but dia tak nak show yang dia mainstream so he gets something that is
macam kawan kau ni ah also macam motor tak banyak but actually people want that kind of bike
ya dia macam gitu jer
maybe ah the dorang just what one year apart kan
dorang sama batch pe so ya
cause dorang cousin
ya hor then that one yang mana muka dorang pun tak sama sangat
case dorang pakai baju
senonoh gitu ah quite presentable
but aku just stress ah
aku just stress tengok dorang
I think dorang tu lah
I think rumi ambil
culinary but I don't know if it's ke tak I think he went to SHATEC or some
cooking school cause aku nampak dia selalu masak jer
uh I don't think rumi take aku dulu ingat dia gemuk dia pernah tunjuk gambar dia
dia tunjuk gambar dia grow up ah that that night at sticky fingers ah dia macam like eh you all want to see or not I last time look like what gemuk gila gemuk gila macam bola sia muka dia
I think masih ada kat dia nya Instagram dia post
probably eh cannot be dia baru enlist baru juga enlist
kau tahu yang dia kambing boy kan
kau tahu advertisement yang kambing
no like I think Suria ada this advertisement where
anak kambing saya and then dorang pergi macam this farm abeh ada advertisement kambing lari-lari rumi was
rumi was that boy in the in the kambing video that's why when aku jumpa dia kan at times like eh
kau macam familiar then tahir first time aku dah tahu dulu cause dia cakap dia in that kambing video and then when I brought tahir out to meet justin zul rumi semua and then macam like
and then keep keep keep guessing then thought he really is the kambing boy but dia tak pernah post ah
tak pernah post at all kau tengok gemuk weh
then dulu dia masih gemuk sikit
he doesn't like pout or whatever shit oh dia ambil gambar nanti boleh nampak macam kalau aku nak ambil selfie atau aku ambil group photo nanti tiba-tiba macam like dia adjust adjust dulu angle dia baru dia stare through camera gitu
oh there kawan-kawan dia
I don't know many picture ambil budak whampoa ah sia
if I'm not wrong dia bukan melayu
but dia berbual melayu ah I think
dia ada malay blood but I don't think it's like full
it's smaller and smaller lagi-lagi kalau kau masuk kan tertiba semua orang kau kenal
macam aku ah aku before aku satu orang pun tak kenal sia aku cuma tahu aku punya secondary school friends and friends
then masuk you will be like eh kau kenal ni kau kenal tu oh aku dari dulu sekolah tu
kau masuk aku rasa kau will meet
cause kau ninety nine
so yang kau meet also is those like long route punya sekolah
lagi lama lah sia
poly itself is already three years kalau kau remote remote
no choice I think last boleh ambil kau twenty six twenty seven
twenty aku masuk twenty fourteen twenty fourteen
twenty fourteen atau twenty thirteen ya
then ada satu budak ni from nineteen ninety
so it's like what twenty four gitu and he's one of the oldest
aku rasa kau kau masuk nanti kau tua sia kau masuk next year kan
eh kau graduate is what month
april oh that means kau aku punya intake ah
should be masuk may atau june aku june intake what
girl aku that time tak ada choice
aku two weeks jer aku dapat surat tu aku dah kena masuk kena campak ah sia
aku nya applications for private schools jer dah rejected say oh we cannot accept you cause your letter is too soon and then cannot cannot apa tu reject aku nya school applications cause
it doesn't makes sense but aku aku tak faham but aku masuk anyway
if aku defer I have a feeling I would go into army
for sure cause abang aku not in recruit anymore what
that time I wanted to lah I die want to cause aku nak main combat combat nak main tembak-tembak semua cause
tak ada orang dapat main tembak apa unless you're in police lah but police punya
weapons weaponry and shit is different is more to apa tu defence atau macam whatever protection lah
duit aku sia
is it the one kat tempat yang yang
dekat dengan some centre thingy where all secondary school last time kena pergi kan
itu yang indoor kan
ya but yang outdoor pun ada pe budak-budak pergi
last time is the same venue just that ada macam this tempat lapang ni
padang or some some plain field lah I don't know I not I not
we'll see lah we'll see kalau kau masuk army ke tak okay
petition for apa eh
of course lah dia nak standardise dia nya family
no cause that time I did remember I had a talk with your mum kat tempat the car wash kat then macam like
oh baba lele is then macam aku and then pop is police then aku macam like okay what kalau adik masuk at least dia belajar real life skills kalau tak masuk paramedic pun at least ada firefighter cause ada dua jer pe yang
hot spot nya vocation then macam like tak nak ah mama nak dia masuk army that's it
sister aku dah macam gitu macam okay but ya lah I mean
for sure kau better off in
army lah cause kau dulu pe
aku rasa mama kau die die tak nak kau masuk police lah or just cause dia nak dia cakap dia nak dia punya son go through the
ah boys punya experience
ah brotherhood dia dia cakap yang oh tak ada brotherhood
macam what where my sisterhood
ada tu ada lah tapi macam you know nanti korang dah pergi station terus kau pecah like go scattered elsewhere
but ya kau masuk army sua
kau have one job okay kau jangan disappoint your mum
technically budak-budak sekarang dorang cakap ada choice pe apa benda before enlistment you can apa tu fill up the options and stuff then they will look through cause dorang cakap banyak orang depression cakap yang dorang kena campak to different organisation and then dorang suffer
instead of going through the proper life skill punya shit
especially banyak orang complain sia aku tak faham aku that day pergi balik to my academy aku tengok
barang-barang kau semua dah siap sia atas katil
it's not like macam dorang bagi kau an empty bag then like my time I
bag bag besar tu then kena pergi two different store rooms cause aku kecil gila so aku kena cari aku punya size know campak kena ambil dorang dorang campak helmet
helmet dorang campak bottle dorang campak jer eh macam like
macam kau tahu aku tak tahu aku rasa dorang were paid to be that much of a an asshole
so dorang macam kat table dorang kan dorang macam like S size S size then budak-budak store dia macam like keluar kan barang abeh macam like campak campak kat pile lah so that pile is all S size another pile is so
kalau aku nak aku ambil from that pile yang dorang campak campak tu ah so aku just ambil jer
then dah tu apa
aku patah balik bunk kau tahu kita kena
apa tu apa dia cakap fall in eh
fall in kat tempat kita punya coy apa benda tu and then kita alpha so alpha tingkat dua jer tak payah nak naik like five six storeys but alpha alpha and bravo
um kita nya bunk is
single bed is not like double deck so I think charlie and delta delta paling worst ah obese kan so delta is the last floor plus dorang bunk bed ya so the entire macam kau tahu the spiral stairs
it's not an open stairs dia macam ada window ah but tutup so kadang-kadang bila dorang dah habis training dorang nak naik kan nanti dia punya tingkap all like foggy
cause dorang punya body sweat and heat kan naik atas and especially dorang kena sampai tingkat enam ke lima girl aku tengok dorang you know bau lah cause they have cause we have to share the stairs ada tiga so
so pandai pandai korang lah scatter kan but I don't know why dorang suka naik kat tangga where it's always alpha yang kena pakai alpha pakai cause alpha tingkat dua jer and then dorang naik itu
but anyway bila aku nampak aku kan nak tidur kan dorang macam kena brief debrief eh kau punya before kau boleh tidur kau kena drink up drink up aku is like
ya I think the bottle besar lah sia
I don't know how many ah I think one litre atau five hundred cannot be five hundred this is not much this is five hundred
so it's one litre ah tu so one litre kau tahu aku dah gini gini means half kan
so aku manage to drink half then aku tak boleh minum then aku
dorang tak boleh cheat what cause nanti at the end of the tu siapa dah habis kena gitu
tak boleh kena ada drip lah kat lantai tak boleh macam
tak boleh weh first day kita belum tukar into our uniform what it's civilian clothes
so basah then aku dah habis kan
kau tahu first day aku pegang bottle aku weak gila ah sia kan
sakit and I don't I'm not like uniform group trained
and is aku pun satu selenge lah dah isi bottle tu and then dia punya body of the bottle is basah dah basah habis slippery abeh aku terslip or is it jatuh aku nak kutip
member tendang ah sia botol aku gi kat longkang then aku macam
aku first first tengok dia like
and then macam like what where's your attitude gitu then macam like no instructor then aku macam then you wait for what dia maki berlambak ah then it's instead of but dia cakap

all S dah kat dalam bag dorang so nicely the bottle is at the bottle compartment diary gutter semua then bila aku pergi tengok aku macam like the hell is this what the hell are they doing then then macam oh they only go for training and then aku tengok training dorang is light so light macam ringan nak mampus
so aku just tak tahu ah sia apa dorang buat
don't know most of them complain cause of homesick lah cause my time that time apa tu ada budak ni
and yet he bila book in kan dia selalu AWOL
bila dah jumpa dia the next week dia dah masuk kan nanti macam like oh dia cakap like oh my after all apparently dia punya family sick but then when the budak-budak provost the security pergi rumah dia

oh wait my mum did say something about like faiz got something to tell the family I macam apa benda
how his mum gonna fork out ten K I mean you have to understand faiz is an only child habis tu dia nya parents also
work humbly lah like kerja enough for dia punya own small family he's not a richie boy a richie solo kid
and all his earnings are to his family and his his own allowances dia tak minta pun ibu dia duit that's for sure I know lah
so kalau dia minta a'ah minta aku two hundred
aku dah order apa dia cakap dia dah order tak ada duit nak bayar then aku macam
aku tak faham sia dia eh buat aku stress sia
lapar lah sia
kau imagine kalau aku abang aku dengan faiz are all girls mak aku minta ah confirm dorang tak nak kan bayar kan bodoh
oh ya yang tempat park avenue tu
not the melayu
I malay melayu
ah sia aku bagi dia eight eight jer lah
abang kau bagi fatin how much
but quite sepet mata dia weird eh was it dengan kau
ah dengan kau lah
kan aku keluar lift then aku cakap eh ni nak salam ke tak eh
then mak aku cakap itu kan bapa pengantin that's the one kan
oh ya ya he got the sepet eyes
damn kau ada kau ada new member
tiger dah accept
bodoh lah
apa sia tak ada duit nyayi
aku tak save pe duit
no I mean like there's a difference what between kau nya savings for your own self savings for
mm but he's holding the entire family punya
every month atau year annually got money lah store in so can take out once cause dia nak let go let go of all so that we all have our individual punya insurances investments and shit so he keep forcing me to be more independent so aku macam like apa ni I am still seventeen at heart but cannot lah
ya ya I think dia bilang
but we met what that time yang kat airport all all her sisters were there except for the youngest one
ya the yang kecil tak ada cause that time me and tahir didn't know that the youngest sister existed ya and then when dia tunjuk adik dia aku macam siapa ni this one my sister huh your older sister no this one my younger huh tahir pun macam like no cause we thought
all youngest cause tahir youngest aku youngest kau youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
cause the mum tanya apa like ah this one can trust or not go overseas this one how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two
cause we are what nineteen birthday kau dah lepas pe
ah kau nineteen lah twenty eighteen what
tahir nya birthday belum lagi apa so
september ya and then kita balik a few days later birthday dia
eleven cause that time you I got apa tu notified it's on my archive
it's too much already eh now banyak sia kawan aku dah post macam like
um much needed eh apa tu much misses holiday either bali lah patong beach lah all those
aku was there like
so mama you already you know right that kakak kan suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab I think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than what do you think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy eh I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to punya tak sedap langsung I mean like it's it's it's nice
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think kalau tak salah first of december
I don't know eh I think so like I saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say um start date thirtieth this monday lah thirtieth november until like
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with err like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last mah so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very rugi because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya I don't know see how lor even if I buy like um the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu ah macam mana
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then I will be rushing then susah if I rush because
I think so ah that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
ya the water sports sounds fun ah but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
um chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
I think you can ask adi if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got madrasah tomorrow
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now err orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
I think like the epok-epok when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old chang kee one cause it's like
err taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
but it was like very little but got flavour lah and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those ondeh-ondeh cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then I cannot tahan also
the apam I ate and
oh then I don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the bhatoora
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the apam
and then the the kuah from the bhatoora also still have
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the bhatoora
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap seh
oh ya baklava also very nice baklava with like teh O sedap seh
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu ah like
oh I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
I think the satay when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the satay punya minyak ah like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat I thought the babat satay I wouldn't like but when I ate it bila masih panas kan sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
I think the I don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice ah but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right I was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit jer the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if I have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so I think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu kan serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
no eh I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
uh naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
uh kita pun terlupa then it's like oh then we just okay lah december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
err kailey and ayumi the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time I told you me and ayumi we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what ah see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru ah don't know how see first
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit lah because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one wah very nice I rugi they never buy the apple flavour
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana kan sedap and then like
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
minum teh like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan ah you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
uh my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the uh tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive lah but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think kalau tak salah it's
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
the ya then macam got a few cafes lah if not also the
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like bugis or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun shiok and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays bugis area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I makan burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal COVID and then I read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam I don't know ah quite susah
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap seh dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
I want the murtabak manis
oh ya this whole year takde pasar malam seh
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like takoyaki all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay lah can still tahan but the you zha kueh burger ramly all wah I really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka seh tu rindu seh
and then drink with mango lassi over there sedap seh that time we drink with the mango lassi woo masam tapi manis
ah ya that time yang deepavali that one that adit left halfway
like you see like I never used before right then I was oh okay then didn't think about it then I was like eh rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay lah can
but I don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
oh ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long eh
one after zohor like one two masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right I pakai right wah it's like eh very nice because the thing is like bedak muka I wanted to I was like I I I
bedak muka I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like eh like wow okay very nice very like very comfortable lah then I was like okay this is like my nenek
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
then I looked at it right I was like wah actually my lipstick colour and my nenek punya lipstick colour about the same ah because like
nenek wear lipstick like that so I was like wah okay and then when I wore it and then the bedak muka eh okay
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum punya
like suddenly a lot of people main layla sia then after that like I don't know she got stronger
so macam layla
eudora eudora eudora pun sama
then siapa lagi
ya a lot of like older older players ah they revamp then macam nowadays
a lot more punya yang we don't use last time macam layla
enam puluh dollar on the game I have no words I am
okay okay lah I mean aku pun spent on harbour so aku tak boleh cakap banyak sangat
let's start playing again ah cause like aku pun nak try naik balik tau cause aku drop sampai like aku from mythic sia mythic you know abeh aku drop so it's like
the fact that okay okay asal kan asal kan kau bahagia ah eh asal kan kau bahagia
I don't think they revamp karina cause macam I don't see a lot of people playing karina so but you can always try then mana tahu kau dah baca kau punya itu build builds semua kan mana tahu kau boleh jadi pro karina so ya and ya it's not as toxic surprisingly lah aku tak tahu asal which is weird lah cause normally kalau cause I always play mage dengan support right then I whenever aku play ah I aku punya sekarang pretty bad ah like noob lah noob so bila
noob ah and ada slurs so macam
nowadays they don't like last time they they ada lah they got say
all the mean words but now they don't eh surprisingly so macam
eh kirakan kau natural born gamer lah ini oh my god

actually apa lagi eh nak cakap
so kirakan kau just take advantage of this the rank lah ini
suka eh mentang-mentang dia dapat asyik asyik menang jer dapat increase kau punya wing rate and everything err
okay lah I mean ada orang main memang macam gitu so
then like dia macam dragon gitu super cool
dia punya actually I've tried before lah and
aku tak bagus ah aku tak boleh main fighter apa aku jadi fighter macam macam
like real seh everytime aku jadi fighter kan confirm confirm aku mati banyak so it's like a no no but ya that dragon is pretty good macam dia punya ulti kan you basically become dragon
okay lah I don't know what's the term lah cause I'm not as nerd as you but um jadi dragon then right nanti okay dia actually kecil tau dia punya character tak besar sangat then bila dia lepas jadi dragon dia dah collect macam don't know what is it called I forgot apa five whatever it's called
then um meet gordon besar sia dah macam
dah macam besar lah besar ya but I think ya you should play you should play that one or
I mean kau pernah main apa and it's when you play freya bagus lah
so macam maybe at that point of time the the the the the the player wasn't as good lah weren't as good but I think if kalau kau
kalau kau just keep on go kan and main more games and practise right confirm kau boleh jadi top sia hear already knowing how nerd you are
then dia punya balmond bagus sia
legit legit super thick like macam susah nak susah nak bunuh dia
and dia pandai main dia tak macam kau macam dia punya ulti kan dia tak hit minion
dia dia tau pandai nak hit so macam I get I get it but it's okay I know baby steps baby steps
actually tank right I think kau pakai hilda atau masha is good lah I mean ya we've talked about it hilda atau masha
aku kalau aku kalau fighter atau tank tak boleh
cause like aku tak I'm not the kind to step up lah aku aku tiada pendirian lah sia
paksa kan nampak

wrong timing lah everytime aku ajak
so macam okay lor
but we are fine with hanging out together lah kau step jer mana kau punya glue glue alamak kita boleh hang out sendiri lah chey just kidding
so just lepak lah basically eh but but we wanted to go trampoline kan so it's like
kita rest on the first day then second day we just go trampoline all the way so we go morning you want to go gym then after that
I was like eh abeh korang pergi gym dah lah gym boleh dua orang jer abeh aku
so macam I boleh lah korang nak pergi gym pergi lah but then maybe aku just I don't know go for a run but
aku tak tahu that area okay I am not very familiar
container dia pun bukannya besar sangat kan
okay never mind we just make do with what we can okay on that day so we just see how it goes because I aku pun tak nak I just don't want you guys to macam
you know like I don't want you guys to in the morning leceh have to go for gym also I mean it's quite tiring right if we sleep then in the morning I mean it's refreshing in the morning lah of course but
right we're going to cook breakfast right then we cook breakfast then we mandi eh we mandi first then we cook breakfast
container macam you already bought the container mah
bought eh as in like I don't know lah aku macam nak stay in the container
the other end is dhoby ghaut right eh salah
okay what quite dekat what actually
so that's the first plan the second option is the one yang itu lah yang
cause from trampoline park right we'll be sweaty already if we want to go other place aku takut
I mean even if we tukar baju and everything we still busuk mah like we still feel very icky and sticky
bro oh my god okay if that's the case then kita punya our breakfast we just eat mcdonald's lor you can lah can lah not not so eh okay what mcdonald's one of the days
hey the what a hater I mean come on sponge isn't supposed to masak also you know come on now
oh sorry I don't go there I don't know about all this stuff because macam macam I see what's in front of me so my little pony is cute like that is cute like that there's nothing go behind it unless you really go make your reason
sudah eh
I think kita boleh start sekarang
tak macam pelik eh buat benda macam gini
you said that you nak berbual pasal
rumah baru kan
okay so rumah baru tu I was thinking
ah initially kan saya nak buat yang
colour kelabu tu kan yang colour grey
entah eh kadang-kadang saya pasal that time saya tengok Pinterest then lepastu
ah apa tu
saya nampak dorang buat macam this deep green punya colour dia macam
royal green punya colour
ada dia macam deep very
dia macam not dark green tau dia macam
emerald green gitu
okay you see this ni kan light kan dia macam something like this
no this one this one yang hujung ni
but it's not very dark what dia macam okay okay jer
so I thought that colour untuk kita punya apa tu
kat mana hall
dalam bilik feature wall kat mana seh
but then our apa err headboard for the bed kan nanti cover feature wall you cover half already what
on top then might as well you taruk frame
entah apa-apa painting ah yang cantik-cantik ke you go and buy kat Spotlight ke
ya habis siapa nak paint
no lah tak jatuh punya lah
okay I ada this idea tau one
okay okay I won't say one room but one wall you know the hallway yang ah okay sekarang it's
right then lepastu ada macam this narrow pathway
ah that pathway kan ada one wall
ah that wall yang now is the study table punya corner yang taruk printer
because sana kan ada um
dia macam ada mini table
and then bawah dia is all drawers
remember makcik tu buat
and then I want to fill up that wall with frames like small small A four-sized ataupun A five-sized frames
so if if it's a walkway I tak nak
no dining table is still kat ni pe uh entrance
sebab apa tau the
if you put raised floor dekat depan entrance
exactly orang dari orang dari luar boleh nampak and then the people sitting at the raised floor can't really see the
so then macam
okay so kat sini is one area
is macam an area of its own
then macam you don't want to talk across like that
so might as well leave it as dining area ah because anyway it's nearer to the dapur what then once you masak-masak kat dapur then you just keluar kan then it's sebelah jer
tak payah nak bulky bulky punya dining table
ah because right now dia punya dining table bulky gila
ye lah ye lah lepastu
dia punya tingkap area is the triangle one kan yang ada bucu kan
ah can ah yang itu yang bucu nya area kita buat raised floor
so at least dorang ada seating area kat situ then you can put you can put books lah or whatever you can put your playstation kat sana if you want to play games
then you don't need to semak kan the living room
because you kalau dah main start main game cam playstation kat
but workstation if kat triangular punya bucu I don't think it work because dia banyak pakai space
and dia punya space tak ah
okay so you can easily duduk lah
almari yang in-built tu
oh ya cakap pasal swing
if we install a swing that mount daripada ceiling
over the years kan nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
cam combine weight lah
nanti ceiling tu macam crack tau
dalam house seram hor
saya macam banyak imagination kalau swing gitu
nanti macam ye lah awak kerja malam
then saya sorang sorang kat rumah
which we we want to buy also what you want to buy weights I want to buy the cardio punya machine
no seh I malas nak pakai tudung jogging kat luar
tak nak ah swing macam
seram pula nanti malam-malam alone
living room saya nak gi toilet dapur asyik nampak jer benda alah tu
actually the I want to put on the wall I want to mount on the wall because dia save space and it looks neater
kita baru move in what
why do you want to alih-alih kan
why you want to alih
if you take it down then you you you jalan wire right and then you just move the mount lah you screw it to some other wall that you want
then the screw hole yang kat lama punya wall you just paste it lah you cover
ah okay faham
but let's say you want to alih you want to alih where where you want to move it
then after that is already the wooden punya punya fake wall
ah tukar mood ah
but then that means you won't have your feature wall macam rumah shah lah
because rumah shah is already permanent like that because he go and buy the big big feature wall
then jalan wire kat belakang lah berlampu lah apa semua all the lights all the lights
but if you want but if you put on top of console why you want to tampal
let's say you want to move it depan tingkap
then the lights shines at the tingkap
we don't pasang first
tu nanti boleh kita tengok macam mana kita nak ubahsuai bilik tu that living room
and then we decide if really want to because light anytime you can pasang what
ah so that one we nanti nanti dulu ah
tapi saya saya tak nak rumah tu too fancy fancy you know what I want it minimalistic and clean and like one solid colour or maybe okay or maybe one one colour and then maybe two shades that's it two shades of the same colour let's say if I choose grey light and medium grey
I don't want macam blue white orange green I don't want I don't want
you want the house to look like one karaoke punya tempat ah
but it's but it's macam pening macam I don't want to come home to that kind of house
yes yes betul tapi we can do that tapi we play with shades we don't play with colour you tahu okay I want the house to look very hotel hotel ish macam atas atas hotel so you see atas atas hotel they use very minimalistic colour
okay and they play with shades and dorang punya furniture is
either if you want to choose wood then it's all macam classic wood if you want to choose metal they won't choose the heavy heavy kind of metal they choose macam ah simple ah structure metal
so it looks very macam nice and clean and comfortable tau and very fresh you don't get sick and tired of it because you're going to stay there for years
and then we can make it gradient that means atas light colour like the same green light colour light green lepastu pelan pelan medium lepastu pelan pelan dark green
if you want to buat macam a bit fancy
ah tapi gradient ada leceh sikit nak buat ah
that one tak salah you have to use sponge then macam
ah so leceh ah
so macam compared to your time spend
paint the entire house you nak paint gradient macam gitu so about the same tapi dapat paint satu bilik jer
and then you have to buy tiga cat
because you nak gradient kan you kena beli tiga tiga shades of cat ah
solid grey let's say grey ah solid one colour one shade then you just buy one big tub of cat
let's say ah let's say you tak nak buat gradient
tahu lah I know
I'm just comparing the ni
berapa litre ah paling besar
lima litre ada lapan litre
yang bangladesh pakai kan
one big tub yang I pernah beli
oh ya cakap pasal brand
ah tadi I nampak satu advertisement and then uh apa tu
I don't know what technology dorang pakai
tak serious serious macam okay macam for example Nippon Paint cakap dia punya paint is odour-free
odourless and also ah kalau apa-apa conteng conteng you can wipe it off
tak I don't know but ya
I know tapi that's how they advertise ah so
they said that the paint purifies the paint purifies the air in your house then macam wah cool lah
tapi I rasa Nippon Paint should be okay lah enough lah Nippon Paint pun everyone use also okay lah
then the the one yang boleh lap ah kalau
err see if kita nak oil paint ataupun the
kan dua
kan ada dua dua type ya
got two types of paint satu is ah
cat minyak lagi satu is cat apa entah cat kapur ah cat kapur
tapi berkilat seh nanti
the finish is berkilat
is this one this one is kapur
ah oil-based is berkilat is like how ah
it's like okay sometimes you know void deck dia punya pillars tengah tengah dia macam ada pattern pattern then it's berkilat
kalau terkena baju ke terkena apa you buang
you buang sudah tu baju
bukan susah nak hilang tak boleh hilang pun jangan harap mm
ah tu ah
then awak masih nak yang
painting painting ayat tu
tak ah
I'm not saying I'm not saying that we gantung atas ah headboard kat katil
kat ni lah apa tu living room ke kat dining room area ke
if you want ayat-ayat then okay lah put lah but frame
no no you go you go to arab street got this one uh kedai dia punya ayat cara dia buat is so modern tau
cantik gila serious serious cantik gila
no but dia punya dorang macam buat three D printing punya tau of the of the tulisan
it's not old school rumah pakcik kind serious
it's not rumah rumah pakcik makcik punya
paste on wall looks like sekolah madrasah seh
you paste on the wall then macam dia macam mengotorkan
okay unless you can show me the kind of paste dekat wall that I am going to like
ya lah that's why I tell you I don't know which one I like because to me tak lawa
because you want to paste it besar besar dekat living room that one macam
apa uh you find me stickers ayat yang pada you cantik
no lah ayat from al-quran ah
ah kalau words of wisdom might as well I take the A B C english one atau malay one
so you find me a ayat
yang paste on yang pada you cantik yang you berkenan
you you pilih
bila masuk rumah kan ada satu tembok
oh tu tak boleh buat apa-apa eh tembok tu
tapi tu nanti nanti ah
sekarang jer store dia dah kecil
the the pakcik kecil kan store what actually the store is big what
mm the the dining table bulky seh like bulky gila punya kes makcik-makcik punya style
I don't want to put it inside a room ah then macam one whole pile kat tepi tu
kita nanti nanti dulu ah
nanti nanti dulu because tu pun renovation seh
a'ah so still akan berabuk juga ah
it's just a fake wall and then a few macam ah apa tu
ah rak-rak
mmhmm a few rak-rak then okay already ah
and pintu okay lah oh ya ah I just realised rumah makcik tu tak ada bomb shelter
and then the our new house mana ada first floor
dia start from second floor what
mm boleh jer
but I think better if orang solat dekat inside the second bedroom ah because if they solat dekat the first bedroom then let's say we have our laptops
kita ada our documents
and then some more if I then some more if I bring in yang tu ah apa tu
exercise nya machine
ah there more comfortable I think more comfortable ask them to solat dekat the second bedroom because we are going to put in this kind of carpet remember
bilik amni looks kecil sebab katil dia besar
you got see before or not single bed then bawah dia boleh pull out
dengar lah dengar
awak punya idea of walk-in
kita ada this macam very short pathway kan actually short pathway tu tak ada
pasal makcik tu dia naik kan wadrobe tu nampak macam short pathway actually it's just a huge square room that's all
macam this dua pintu so you tambah lagi satu pintu ah
and then tempat saya bersiap my
because my tempat siap is tengah tengah what so if I getting ready in the middle abeh you want to walk where got space
because your baju there what
actually kan saya tak suka bersiap duduk tau
I like to stand and siap
I thought it's with a chair and then macam
ah faham
just to taruk my barang barang makeup right
actually I don't want cermin
I don't like that kind of cermin I like this kind of cermin yang you can go up close
no I don't want to sit down I won't ever sit down when I'm tengah bersolek
mm laci lah laci kecil
can ah then the laci I can put my tudung and then kat atas tu macam I buy the transparent plastic rak-rak then put lipstick lah ke apa semua
most most probably berselerak
dia tak selerak bila apa tau macam the first few days that I kemas
nanti dah after the first week terus dah macam berterabur macam ribut taufan kat situ
orh side of the bed ya you sebelah tingkap ah
mm mm side side siapa panggil side side bed
mm tutup belum
because I was thinking if ada enough space eh if
couch kat kat kaki katil
you know okay when you go hotel hotel kadang-kadang dorang ada small couch kat depan katil
that's where you sit down drink kopi or you want chit-chat but you don't want to be on the bed you want to sit down
kat wall lah
gantung kat ceiling a bit ugly you know
tak nak ah nanti jatuh kena kepala
orh rak eh
one simple rak
then after that kita taruk projector kat situ ah
ah then can taruk frames also
then macam it brightens up the room
it does dia macam you have so many memories then you can frame it up
cantik what
because it's very personalised so macam okay for example you go travelling and then you beli painting or something and then you come back to singapore then you buy a frame then you nicely frame so macam it means something to you
maybe orang luar yang datang visiting tak tahu lah but you know what
because you are the owner of the house so you macam okay aku tahu aku beli painting ni dari mana and then uh okay this picture was me and you from where we go
because okay kebanyakkan orang kumpul this benda-benda sentimental lepastu they chuck it one side or they put it in the box they put it in the album then they never look at it
dia macam not very useful lah
eh don't want ah ugly ah tampal tampal tampal gitu
dah macam bilik budak
dah macam apa teenagers teenagers punya bilik
wow I'll be your age sekarang
tapi you dah empat puluh
imagine boleh imagine tak
awak dah empat puluh you'll be celebrating your four zero
hello and then bila you celebrate your four zero birthday birthday I belum sampai I masih tiga puluh tiga
as long as I dapat feature wall yang ada frame
syukur you know syukur
can kita dah cakap
stop sekejap jantung
benda yang kita kena siap kan dalam masa yang terdekat eh
seh dalam masa yang terdekat
bahas twenty twenty featuring nursalihati
okay kita kena beli barang-barang untuk bersihkan okay do you still want to hire people to sanitise the house
you want to find murah how murah kita five room tau sayang
five room you nak sanitise tu toilet lagi
kita punya dapur dah ada tempat washing lagi that extra space
dia tengok rumah kita dah macam
how many men he want to use how many chemical how much chemical they want to use untuk sanitise the rumah
dia nak charge sama rumah
yes sayang kita five room
okay yes sayang kita five room tetapi kita five room bukan five room tau
kita nya five room besar tau sayang
then they want to cakap the price bopian ah dorang dah sampai pe
ya lah because you thought what ninety plus square feet ninety plus square feet kita seratus lebih seh
tanya bulat bulat lah you
if they say oh around ninety to hundred twenty square feet can kita berapa square feet
kita nya one
one five ke one three ah lupa ah
kalau dia kata around ninety to hundred thirty okay can
kalau dia kata around ninety to one hundred then you kena cakap dengan dorang ours is above hundred
let's say if they cincai cincai boleh ah then okay ah
dasar budak malaysia
I thought apa
okay so anyway sanitise awak masih nak sanitise
wash means kita kena beli macam
then baru sanitise
then bila sanitise kalau melekit
we cannot check we cannot tell them ah makcik pakcik ah you must clean the house before move in banyak cantik kau punya muka kau fikir aku housekeeping

ah dia put afan name down as macam guarantor kau tahu kind of thing ah
but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed one
but you are initially macam kau okay with that ah actually
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
pinjam duit shit
making macam
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
macam you ask me to get a guard
macam eh eh eh bodoh you know that kind of thing
kau jangan get rile up ah
okay so the other day aku jumpa dia
oh it's one of those kind I like like like um on the video kadang-kadang
they would ah play macam
okay so dia cakap macam
kalau aku hilmi
then ah he wafan was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less you're saying
I was wondering kalau
matair jer
so that's the thing I was trying to get across to him ah macam you know I understand where he's coming from sebab
help help that's a fucking understatement kan ya but macam
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light ah I'm saying that I totally not okay
like would you still hang out with me tak
and then macam cakap
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap ah
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that ah that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this one pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti aku tak boleh focus
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay I I would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau ah kind of thing
aku macam okay
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
okay so I what I don't see where you're coming from ah macam aku faham but I don't think it's matter of gender tau
bodoh gila pe
sama sama situation as us ah
bulgy chonkers juga tau
dia punya their food
kan dorang punya makanan
the portion kan besar gila
tapi there's no incentive too you know
but that one also doesn't paint like err macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
okay uh as a brown guy here aku pun free education ah up to a point
we get sidetrack macam anjing
other factors juga
err apa nama dia
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising ah it's
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
it's a dengki thing ah
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
sebab ah asian dengan
wait wait ah kau sixty one right
kind of situation aku macam I was eighty six kilo sia
aku used to have an issue about eating ah I don't why like I I was constantly lapar like hungry

aku pun nak join his side but I cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know I've I've um contemplated about lah some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as I find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap oh it doesn't feel transparent
betul ah that's what fahim adhere
no not my family dinner at simpang kan
ah aku dah
aku dengar tu aku dah macam oo
roma dah stand at attention

ah tapi dalam gambar tu ada empat
drumstick dengan chicken wing attach together

ah four of that so macam worth it lah so we bought that two meal
habis um
ya dan

ya and then ayah pun tak ada kena carpet pe might as well just remove everything lah
effort have to put in like the kayu have to go through the window

top ten goals yang pertama
jujurnya tahun dua puluh dua puluh tak ada goals
ah okay jujurnya tahun dua puluh dua puluh tak ada goals goals dia adalah untuk uh be a better person then I think
mm but another can but another side of me yang in terms of ibadah semua itu memang problem lah
err twenty twenty was the disaster one but family akak berjaya habiskan puasa enam ah that one ah itu saja yang pasal ibadat
puasa enam syawaal yang lain macam tahun-tahun sebelum itu jarang lah kita orang dapat spend
masa untuk ini lah basically pasal syawal lah gitu yes okay so ida

okay mm mm makin lama makin jauh kan
I see okay lagi
ada letak target nak kahwin ke tahun lepas
ah yang pertama apa ah itu ada list tahun lepas itu sudah lupa sudah
err top ten achievement eh pertama
err tapi ada
err daripada dua belas bulan itu ada dua bulan saja yang
err macam a bit the struggle lah macam tak tak ada gaji langsung macam itu
ah tapi ada memang ada lah yang bulan-bulan lain semua ada
okay and then um itu yang pertama yang kedua um
akak ready untuk jumpa psychiatric err yang itu yang kedua that one
aka rasa macam that one is a big achievement juga lah
ah ya lah tak maksudnya the the apa ini err
decision itu dibuat eh dalam dua puluh dua puluh lah okay
okay and then top achievement juga sebab dapat puasa enam bersama-sama keluarga
yang keempat ah dapat menggajikan pekerja
lagi um empat alhamdulillah empat
yang kelima banyak tahu sepuluh kan
yang kelima um
walaupun uh stranded dekat sini dengan awak saja okay
um tapi okay lah maksudnya kita tak lah begitu

a'ah tak cukup sepuluh ini yang keenam mm
hari itu ada list tau okay yang keenam okay err in terms of business juga
err product lah not not release tapi err progress ke situ iaitu shine
jauhari and hero cilik
err enlisted ah sudah lah satu dua tiga okay sudah cukup sepuluh okay ida

yang itu yang itu dengan business eh
seribu tiga oh okay
mm baru dua
wow okay so itu sudah kira berapa empat ah
kosong dua satu paper satu okay lagi
top ten achievement apa lagi
huh hari itu ida ada share dengan akak dalam masa dua bulan ida berjaya contact berapa orang
that one is your ah kak consider top ten achievement juga lah kan buat apa
ya ah akak baru tadi lupa ingat yang akak punya viva
viva kan ya allah after five years ah gila ah okay alright
err tak cukup lagi ida ida tak cukup
okay akak ada satu lagi top achievement akak
akak first time bayar zakat pendapatan
that one is the first one akak bayar zakat pendapatan alhamdulillah
okay okay okay ida ada lagi
what were the top five painful lesson that you learnt allah
okay akak dulu
staff yang kita orang baru ambil bekerja selama sebulan berhenti
okay dia cakap ya lah sebab macam kita orang tak dapat pindah then kalau pindah macam mana business dekat sini and so on kan so macam dia
ya lah mempertikaikan mengapa perempuan tak boleh ke buat business kan ha ah macam tu a'ah I don't know we don't know
the first one the second one ada juga staff yang berhenti
that is under our ini lah macam kita sponsor
satu team um e-sports
dia tak lah directly tapi that
because the person yang err handle yang team e-sport itu adalah among our business partners
yang our staff yang bukan lah our staff macam his staff yang berhenti itu kan
memang macam rude lah bahasa yang dia gunakan sangat rude
dia itu macam ini tak err bukan competence tak competence lah dia kata tak bagus lah apa semua memang rude
memang rude kalau baca message dia memang rude
a'ah itu ah macam kan kan sudah tak pernah kerja tempat lain tapi
tak apa lah okay so that one is second
ingat tak waktu bulan tiga apa yang berlaku we need to refund
fifteen K to uh our clients lah because waktu itu ah
project tak dapat jalan and COVID comes and then
actually dia orang nak minta kita bayar dua puluh ribu ah
tapi err we said to them yang kita kan sudah buat kerja sikit so kenapa nak refund full
so dia orang minta refund lima belas ribu then
that one is very tough lah untuk kita semua for her for us as a team and
for others lah juga untuk dia juga lah
and that one is better for her juga lah sebenarnya okay
okay so empat saja boleh tak
terlalu painful lah okay ida tak nak cakap tak nak cerita lima okay
waktu dia susah bukannya waktu kita susah lah okay
balik lah
mm mm cakap saja lah terus terang
okay yang awak rasa macam top lima yang memang awak rasa awak buat keputusan yang betul yang awak betul lah
ya sama
walaupun kita duduk seorang tapi rasanya macam yup yup tapi tak lah memikirkan masalah di rumah
okay that one is the first one sama dengan akak juga second one
okay alright teruskan teruskan
tempat asal lah tempat awak tinggal awak dapat tawaran dekat tempat asal awak lahir okay then
stay tempat yang ada sekarang tempat yang awak belajar lah
err saat rasa macam ada certain soalan macam a bit repeat lah
okay let's say sudah tak ada
apa ah top five things yang you got right is the first one is I made a
bukan lah ada bukan lah make decision pun I terpaksa pun untuk hantar thesis I supaya I dapat viva
nak kena mengasuh dia orang bagi faham lah apa benda lah lepas itu tak faham-faham juga
but then ada staff yang we got it right yang bagus
walaupun macam yang mungkin macam gaji yang kita bagi pun tak ini tapi we promise to her that we might be give you
better later because kita pun tak kaya kan
so kita tak nak lah share kekayaan itu di kalangan kita saja kita mesti nak share dengan orang lain juga
okay so I'm not sure it is the got right ke tak tapi
ah mempertimbangkan lah okay entah lah ada berapa sudah empat kan empat saja lah okay next question
okay akak dulu ah okay risiko terbesar yang akak ambil adalah
macam to from kelas mengaji err class mengaji physical to online fully
and memang struggle ya allah ya rabbi buat facebook live and so on macam gitu kan
tapi we managed to do that lah walaupun struggle
totally memang change and then after that we build um err jauhari
masih dalam progress and hero cilik waktu itu and like then juga shine untuk board game lah
tak ada okay we skip all that question then soalan keenam
what was the smartest decision you made dekat sama kan
okay tak payah lah okay next which three important relationship improved the most family tadi awak cakap lagi
alright okay dua okay so macam akak pun akak the first one is
err ya lah our relationship eh kita tak ada siapa-siapa kita dua orang saja ida okay with my room mate dengan ida
akak rasa akak better sikit dengan ayah akak kot
selama ini akak ada perception yang macam
anggap tak baik apa semua kan tapi bila akak macam bantu dia untuk kerja sekejap
kak kak nampak lah dia usaha dan dia struggle
kak relationship dengan itu lah ah okay okay
ah that guy okay cuma
ya lah macam dulu kan akak ini macam lelaki ini apa teruk ah apa semua kan but right now okay just be understanding lah okay nombor sembilan
dia beri greatest impact dekat ida lah
okay aduh sebab
ya lah sebab tahun ini kan kita jarang masa bersama dia kau orang okay untuk akak
err ada dua lah dua close friend okay err
bukan lah someone yang yang bersama-sama dengan kami sudah dalam business partner
tapi dia tetap seorang sahabat yang ada kadang-kadang sometime bila kita macam
contact dia minta nasihat ke apa ke walaupun saya memang marah lah dekat dia tetap lah orang yang beri impact kepada saya lah okay
first one jadi seorang yang lebih baik atau seorang yang pemarah ada dua kan the second one um
okay second one yang memang sentiasa kalau misal kata okay dia kalau dia ada masalah dia akan call
dia akan call akak tapi dia pun sedia untuk mendengar apa masalah kita
okay then last year is the first one yang akak cerita dengan dia after few years lah sudah berkawan kan
baru lah akak reveal dekat dia siapa yang bagi teratai akak rasa tahun lepas ya that one
akak reveal ah sedangkan orang bagi sudah teratai sejak tahun dua ribu sebelas
ah sudah sembilan tahun sudah waktu itu kawan err apa
yang kawan akak yang sudah ini kan yang sudah yang sudah pindah balik itu
err akak tanya okay okay memandangkan awak sudah tak ada kan okay ada satu benda yang ini nak bagi tahu okay so bagi tahu lah yang akak yang bagi teratai itu okay
um my parents err no I mean not err err macam
err macam sometime not in a good side but somehow
it turns to be a bad side juga okay uh so
greatest impact sebab greatest impact tak tahu apa benda ah okay soalan nombor sepuluh ida
okay ramai itu okay
ya lah family lah kan family mak ayah adik itu saja lah
third spend time the most ini boleh jadi orang yang kita call
yang paling nak akak cakap dengan top first
asnah lah itu tak dapat dinafikan itu memang top first lah
sudah okay next how did those five people influence you wow ambil engkau
yes so dia banyak bagi nasihat and so on lah
okay bagus bagus so itu lah yang paling most impact lah
okay so akak err
influence yang the first one is asnah
dia yang suggest sudah lama sudah dia memang suggest untuk akak pergi jumpa psychiatric
instead of counsellor ah sebab dia tak dia rasa it's not ini lah kan
and then after yang um
akak punya akak go talk dengan doctor doctor itu kan yang akak cakap dengan awak itu
and then after that akak decide memang akak tak nak go for university punya
akak go for memang professional punya field lah
and then um apa macam mana dia apa ini how impactful these five people ini
um tadi parents akak dan juga akak cakap pasal madrasah kan okay so madrasah yang akak pergi ini um
dia orang err most of them are refugees
okay and there is uh ada satu macam episode lah yang mana seorang budak ini dia
ganggu tau lembu dekat kawasan itu
orang kampung lah kata dia nampak okay but then um and then
macam pihak penguasaan madrasah ini macam marah lah and tampar budak itu depan mata akak
so itu akak rasa macam sudah lah you sudah lah dia refugees tahu dia memang
macam itu lah kan macam memang ya lah kita tak tahu negara dia dulu macam mana kan
memang ya lah mungkin dia orang bermasalah tapi dia dia orang adalah kanak-kanak yang ada perasaan
okay so issue nya adalah budak itu duduk tonggeng-tonggeng
punggung dekat orang kampung lah apa semua lepas itu main lepas itu macam
lepas itu err I talk to my dad lah waktu itu kan macam mm
anak ah cucu dia buat benda yang sama tak sama saja so apa
apa beza cucu dengan orang yang dia jaga ini ini kan
sama saja dia orang pun budak juga even err ya lah memang cucu lah umur bawah kecil sikit kan tapi sama saja
uh these refugees kulit hitam ke kenapa kita tak respect dia
okay so that one like yang I rasa err macam lagi kasihan dekat budak-budak semua ini so
these people ini yang give greatest impact to me lah okay soalan nombor sepuluh
who are the five people you spend the bukan ah sudah sudah salah salah nombor dua belas nombor dua belas what were the best five books you read
tapi dia tak ada cakap dua puluh dua puluh tahu dia bagi tahu what were the best five books you read itu saja
err daun tidak membenci angin macam itu ah
dia pasal cerita saja macam itu ah and
buku itu daripada bukan daripada ini lah dia memang negara luar punya
apa uh daun tidak membenci angin macam itu tajuk dia kalau tak silap ah ah okay
buat cerita apa ini dengan activity dengan budak-budak macam itu lah tapi
and ada satu masa itu ah dia punya quote dia macam ini ah
okay kita banyak menyalahkan takdir tapi semua yang jadi ini semua tuhan sudah tahu
even macam daun yang jatuh pun allah atas kan sudah allah kan ah
so benda itu just go with the flow jer okay so the first book
okay ida ada lagi tak buku sambil-sambil tu kita tukar-tukar lah
buku english
okay nanti aku nak baca
oh okay dia orang tak kahwin
okay walaupun dia sudah tak ada
okay okay akak ada satu lagi err buku yang akak rasa macam ini
ah sepanjang COVID err kak asnah suggest untuk akak baca lah who moved my cheese
ah that one ah dia macam okay
err dia orang dia ada beberapa ini lah beberapa character mm
tikus lah yang mana yang stay
sampai lah cheese itu habis
maksudnya tapi sebelum cheese itu habis lagipun um waktu cheese itu ada dia orang sampai sudah buat rumah apa semua dekat situ
which is these people adalah orang yang cepat settle down
tapi bila cheese sudah habis macam mana kan tempat sudah dekat situ apa semua so macam itu lah
and another one adalah orang yang nampak orang yang tahu cheese ini akan habis
so dia get ready with another another option okay
and daripada dua ekor ini juga dia orang ada yang berpecah satu lagi memang nak stay
berharap yang orang akan hantar lagi cheese dekat situ
cari cheese tapi tak jumpa struggle jatuh terduduk macam nak mati nak macam semua lah
tapi akhirnya dia jumpa cheese
uh tapi tapi after that the fasa yang sangat sangat teruk lah okay
ah itu lah who moved my cheese lah okay lagi ada buku lagi tak baru dua
ah then another one is err buku karangan liyana musfira ini err
dia macam untuk buku untuk wanita-wanita lah yang mana yang orang rasa orang cakap ah sudah tua tak kahwin lagi
ah sudah kahwin tak ada anak err sudah kahwin satu anak nak dua
lepas itu orang yang memang pilih untuk business dan sebagainya dan semuanya silap
a'ah kan tak ada benda yang betul pun tapi asyik dipertikaikan so macam mana kita nak
err apa bangun daripada scars pun dia bagi tahu okay
ada ada fasa yang macam bila akak seorang then ah then a lot of things kan
this world doesn't deserve me ah macam itu ah so
this is the first lah yang I I'm grateful for is I am still alive
that one lah akak punya satu ah akak tak terfikir lagi
walaupun masih ingat-ingat lah kan sis K of course ah tak boleh lupa
right err benda yang patut disyukurkan lagi adalah
actually banyak ah business apa semua akak

lama sia
bual jer
tak ada stress
is it yang is it yang reflect journal is it the journal yang
a'ah I can hear you snoring from the hall itu lah it reminds me macam aku punya poly days whenever aku tengok muka kau penat kan like macam it reminds me of my poly
that's why kau akan nampak aku selalu satu malam jer dekat rumah tak buat apa-apa actually aku duduk dalam bilik fikir fikir-fikir benda but then
kau pun nampak ah at end of the day bila aku macam submission aku macam oh chill and happy and everything sebab tak fikir banyak then when is the start the semester start balik lah all the stress and all the macam eh don't disturb me now don't talk to me don't don't whatever don't
eh but kalau aku boleh pull through aku lagi design background I don't have any design background kita madrasah we don't have any art school tak ada D&T art and craft I cannot draw a straight line ke apa-apa but then
okay I cannot draw a circle straight line boleh with a ruler but then still aku manage to pull through ah so macam aku selalu tengok
kau stress kan aku fikir macam ah lah you are left with err one and a half more years you are already in two point two ah so are you excited for three point one chey
huh but you are in a school what kau kat polytechnic semua benda kau task to do you complete what
eh that actually happen to me bila poly uh apa ni bila during internship whereby aku punya internship kan aku design web design dengan digital pin
abeh time tu aku punya task untuk buat it was already aku punya internship was just three months long sebab kita punya panjang abeh
during aku eh three to four months internship so during macam like the first one third of the internship I had to design something for an overseas museum
so aku nak kena design macam dorang punya apa ni interactive punya benda and it's not even a topic that is being touched on dekat poly tak ada pun imagine kau kena buat punya benda
kira macam code tapi untuk punya system orang letak I pad dorang boleh scan abeh kita orang nak kena design that code
and actually at the start of the project it was only me and I had to design for four building pasal museum dia ada four buildings then I had to design all four outer thing so that when visitor datang dorang boleh scan benda tu initially aku kena buat sorang-sorang
then kau internship sama-sama dengan kawan lah ask your friend to internship like sama-sama company like apply together
mana tahu like macam kalau tak kan my company tiga orang apply three people apply me and apa ni kawan aku yang lelaki yang end up dengan sama-sama internship and another aku punya close friend but in the end dorang reject my close friend sebab ada dua intern kat company tu and dorang can only like
hire two interns at that point of time and is a good thing dia ada sebab dia more vocal than aku so macam because
I think it's because it's an environment whereby I'm not comfortable with it's an environment aku tak comfortable jadi macam
aku take a very long time to berbual even dengan aku punya supervisor but luckily but the thing is during aku punya internship kan is not the supervisor my supervisor dia macam assign assign benda jer dia cuma assign aku for one task which is to
it's a mural wall for a company yang dia dah buat cuma bila dia send dekat client client nak kena revise so aku yang revise that file which in the end bila aku submit balik sebelum aku habis internship aku punya supervisor kata aku buat salah abeh by then client dah accept aku punya design so macam hmm pandai-pandai lah kau kau betulkan aku punya file tapi client dah macam eh okay macam gitu tapi during aku punya internship was
aku punya kira macam senior one of kita orang punya senior dia macam higher sikit dari supervisor punya position dia yang apa ni uh overlook aku dengan ni pasal aku ada tiga project afterwards kan so this tiga project was overlook macam dia oversee kita punya design work bukan aku punya supervisor
cuma dia pasal aku punya mural wall
tapi client dah accept so macam aku nak pergi balik tempat tu abeh tengok mural wall tu pasal it's for pasal dorang sewa tempat this company punya one of the room so mural wall dia ada dekat company itu so macam kalau aku tebalkan muka maybe boleh datang tengok tapi jangan pergi atas lah
huh macam mana
dia punya company dia buat apa as in what is the
research pasal
ah but then dia punya nature of the work tak perlukan dia to be in office lain macam like certain
courses ataupun kerja yang macam there was one guy the same area as aku punya internship pasal aku punya office based kan dia punya another group of friend from different course tapi kita orang punya course related to mass communication eh dorang bukan mass comm dorang communication design aku punya interactive media design so dorang punya is like dekat
macam printing factory tau so aku tak tahu whether kalau during that time lah if is like during period
abeh kalau kau macam magazine ke newspaper ke cetak buku sekolah ke
abeh siapa nak jaga machine kat sana
wah rabak seh can't imagine myself if during imagine you
kau ada kawan year one kan
ah lagi especially kita madrasah student kan jadi kita tak pernah exposed to like apa ni people from different races
different ya ke like macam all this while korang berbual kat sekolah berbual melayu jer pe
ah okay lah like during my time is like total culture shock aku kena joget semua
wah like looking back right macam haram sia aku buat semua
ah kau tak regret
ya I remember ya you had a apa ni project during secondary school I scolded you for like macam huh benda macam gini simple pun tak boleh buat ya that is so
pathetic pun ada
actually honestly kan like since aku first kan among kita punya siblings kan so macam aku tak ada kakak or abang to ask things from mummy and is like totally apa ni dorang tak tahu apa-apa and they depend on me kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik shahrul macam mana nak anuh ni semua kan dulu bila aku start pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku can imagine last time before kita ada internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend yang pandai internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours pakai dia punya internet computer remember so aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya email dorang tolong buatkan aku punya friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad tak akan aku nak tunjuk and you like what kindergarten lagi pe time tu like time tu I was
okay kau baru primary kan
no it was like primary four primary six ya lah ya so primary four primary six yang kita jalan gi apa ni bedok library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime nak pergi mana then I say or else mummy tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi library so last time kalau nak buat research ke apa pergi library ah abeh tu then bila abi beli computer letak dekat bilik that's when slowly but then kita pakai internet untuk buat apa tengok youtube video game
ya so dulu pun macam struggle pun struggle sendiri juga like macam ah yes and that's the ni apa ni
aku by the time kan boleh nampak beza tau so time tu aku ingat masa aku tuition ah aku tuition dengan kak mon kak mon sama umur kan cuma aku first child dia third
so bila kita kat tuition I never felt the difference between me and mon so aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama like we learn together we grew up together like we had silat and everything like that and like on these last few days of the kita orang punya tuition ni the kakak cakap
ah mar anak nombor berapa then I say first then mun berapa oh patut lah nampak beza then I was like huh there is a difference macam dia kata in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her macam aku merepek-merepek pun there is still a difference between
tu lah so last time aku struggle ah kau nampak aku macam I had it all like some uh macam senang but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like macam mana nak pakai computer macam mana nak buat ni nak buat report macam mana nak buat homework okay of course I had tuitions lah back then but
dapat laptop
itu lah susah kan dulu hidup
and tak macam dulu
macam kau sekarang by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would macam huh benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu
but then kau imagine kau and last time it was not as apa ni is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation tau so macam memang kena belajar and last time I honestly I was one of the macam lembab
macam everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year aku buat friendster
dah tak popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook oh I think it was facebook facebook atau messenger it was the messenger yang popular
kau tak tahu messenger apa kan
dia macam chatting punya benda
itu pun I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail ke microsoft so tapi by then aku dah ada messenger terus facebook dah popular so macam bila orang berbual pasal friendster aku macam hmm oh I also had friendster oh nama apa then I was like
if you okay kalau aisha ada time okay lah I know aisha baru masuk poly life kan like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one macam pada kau paling memorable sekali
rabak in what sense
tak ada satu pun jadi monitor ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi lah
since but bila first time kau jadi monitress kan was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes aku tahu aku favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and abang
bila ni which year oh my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject cakap jer lah dah lepas pun
ah class ni tak payah dengar lah
kat ear punya height oh
tak tinggi mana shoulder oh
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you pilih which madrasah you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during kak punya time
kita orang tak ada pilihan unless you choose to change school then kita change school kalau tak all the way kita in the same school lah
so time tu bila dah masuk secondary kan bila primary kan kita orang macam
whereby madam rosanna was our form teacher and she taught us everything dia ajar
dia ajar ah english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday kita orang akan mix so someday we just do all english
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class ah like thirty five of us work together madam rosanna being herself a creative teacher she like do art project untuk kita orang semua and that's how we became closer especially during ah like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
ah during the june holidays lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat artworks for example ah old vases kita orang paint balik to sell during our end kita orang punya tempat yang kita for the competition was at tampines mall you know where dorang have the bazaar sebelah tampines mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar hari raya
no even now yang kalau ada bazaar dekat tampines
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of aku punya classmate dia kau tahu yang vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it yang colour colour purple colour blue macam vanguard sheet oh my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet ah
so dia pakai macam vanguard sheet depan belakang and then dia jual envelope macam untuk envelope macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition kita orang punya class dapat eh kita orang punya sekolah we first time arabia masuk and kita orang menang dapat fourth position
all thanks to madam rosanna so but she put the most effort lah because we were like only primary four kita berapa years old then ten years old we don't tak tahu banyak benda kan so then after that when kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu primary four bila primary five kita split class
they just tak ada
so last time during my dorang tak ada my time right dorang tak ada macam ah yang pandai
yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga kan dorang tak ada split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those yang susah juga lah
korang seven levels seh A B C D E F six okay
oh because they want you guys to focus on studies or ah but did you look forward to that camp so tak ada lah kesah sangat
antisocial lah tu so okay back tu aku punya cerita so bila primary five kita split class tau abeh kita orang punya class ground level ground level kan so satu class satu class it all happen when mummy kan dah start jual kan kat situ so aku selalu stay back
so I think there was a kita orang punya senior ke apa tak puas hati dengan some girl from of course lah boy so dorang macam unhappy with the between class five A and five B ah so boyfriend kat five B suka girl kat five A girl kat five A suka lelaki kat five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six tak puas hati
so what happen was like one of kita orang punya time find that I always stay back pasal mummy jualan kan kat sekolah kan so aku tunggu lah mummy habis baru balik sama-sama what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
dorang koyakkan benda dalam class tu
ada a few clique until today aku masih ingat pasal that is the same clique
who koyakkan aku punya duty roster bila secondary one
kalau dengar okay so dorang dah koyakkan the duty roster and the next day bila five B datang dorang cakap lah aku yang koyakkan
sebab aku yang stay back
yes and ya ya pasal aku tak hold grudge sangat aku hold grudge yang secondary one punya tapi semua dah besar
so lepas tu then after that after that whole incident
mengamuk ah
tak ah because it was just not me I was with another friend kita orang sama-sama
ah macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan by the time akak balik dia pun balik so all this while kita orang sama-sama but the other class knowing that aku yang selalu stay back tunggu mummy
then dorang ni ah
or maybe bila aku tak ada dekat class I didn't stay at the classroom what I will just stay at the musollah ataupun dekat luar
ah so what happen afterwards was kita orang start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school semua orang kena stay back semua dari five A semua dari five B kena stay back aku daripada five A kan dengar
dorang tak tahu tu primary six aku tahu pasal siapa lagi yang stay back tapi pasal dia senior aku tak ada senior lagi nak tolong aku so it happen to the extent that madam rosanna form teacher kita orang bila primary four gather kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang
then I say you were together last year macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk primary five semua macam gini things like that so in the end kita salam and dah habis ah
tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this kakak-kakak stay back
and I knew the history of all this aku kan orang tengah semua benda aku tahu ah yes
ya tapi time rapat dengan dia so ya
tu lah kakak tak suka tu primary five bila but then bila dah masuk secondary kita masih split class sampai secondary one time tu pun sec one a lawan dengan sec one B
pasal kita just annoyed dengan dorang like there was this one trend semua orang akan pakai this jacket do you know my jacket bukan varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket yang kau tahu yang grey and another pink
pink dengan blue star aku selalu pakai bila bila it was that trend that kind of jacket and ya backpack kat belakang do you know what aku punya backpack yang colour brown yang boleh clip ya okay it was a trend and there's this one group of girls dorang pakai tu
and I was so annoyed pasal dorang macam flaunt dorang punya because it was in trend and dorang macam flaunt and the whole group nanti ambil gambar and things like that abeh aku annoyed gila seh so aku pun tak suka dorang then comes the teacher day punya time tau so bila tengah teacher day punya time one of aku punya classmate instead of tolong decorate aku punya class
dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong decorate kan kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam oh my god abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang until dorang secondary one
then bila kita orang masuk secondary two kita sama kelas balik
kita orang different class after that bila masuk balik secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two pasal by then pun kita dah pindah dekat toa payoh kan so classroom dah lagi besar so bila yang secondary two tu
kita orang macam ada certain orang kita tak click sebab dia gatal
but other certain students we are okay with them ah by then kita dah quite click then after that bila masuk secondary three end of secondary three kita ada secondary three camp
ah whereby dalam secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby kita orang semua sama-sama except kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya time
so other than kita orang semua tak sama-sama actually bila camp itu lah semua orang start rapat
um level one ni kat sekolah mana
I think the only time whereby kita orang tak tidur sekolah so last time kita ada was one week and
apa ni kita orang ada arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language paling susah kan so what was ustazah mashallah beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur a day before the paper I think that was thursday kira arabic paper was on friday so dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang so the reason why kita semua tidur kat sekolah was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead kita of course girls being girls when we are together kita orang ketawa-ketawa and the thing is only girls yang tidur
kat sekolah and there was only one ustaz and another male student to accompany the ustaz lah is the only guy in school ustaz was there to look after us lah tak akan kalau all girls kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi kan
then after that during kita orang punya ni ada something happen again so kita orang tidur dekat creepy honestly even bila camp bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh and last time tak ada cermin last time there was no mirrors then we bila dah new sikit that is scary lah so last time bila masih tengah kat kita orang semua tengah duduk it was already at eleven plus
mah then kita orang pun dah habis revise because we going to wake up earlier before subuh the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school kat sekolah kan exam dia esok pagi semua student datang balik ah dekat arabiah dekat hall
then lepas tu
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang facing parade square I think it was there
lepas tu what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby kereta jalan then bunyi imagine ustaz muhammad kereta was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so tak gerakkan kereta pun semua orang
yang kereta jalan ya
park kereta dekat depan
oh yang sebelah security punya ya
and it couldn't be from the road pasal road dah jauh
so kakak punya the more okay I
tak pernah experience benda-benda seram
sampai orang point out
so meaning ataupun staycation ingat staycation dekat dengan old changi hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu kan so macam
aku macam tahu tempat dia very eerie very seram
our chalet time kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali kan tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis the whole thing baru orang cakap kau rasa bila oh it wasn't only me
ah tapi okay tapi itu bukan the most scariest experience aku ada the one imagine ada satu kali tu kita orang ada staycation eh bukan staycation yang chalet dekat pasir ris
pasir ris holiday flat time itu pasir ris holiday flat baru renovate lagi sekali tau they just renewed renovated that's why kita the year before is at changi yang kita ambil
then the following year baru kita buat kat pasir ris pasal dorang dah renovate tempat dia so ah so that time aku pasal aku tak boleh overnight that day kita orang buat barbecue aku tolong the day before
pasal after that day barbecue kan kita balik siang cik shahrul fetch kita orang
so I decided to help a day earlier because kita ambil four days three night so thursday just ambil kunci friday datang petang decorate prepare benda-benda barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the punya macam retreat pasal tengah ada submission
poly submission so yang tolong cuma lima orang jer akak
kak sumayah dengan lagi tiga kakak ni ah kak jah kak nana kak nisa so kita orang semua tengah bersih-bersih sekali dorang kena beli benda tau
dorang nak kena dorang nak kena beli benda then okay ah tinggal kakak dengan kak maya tengah prepare pasal kak maya in charge of the creation
so aku tolong ah kak maya potong-potong benda tampal-tampal semua untuk batik remember the batik thing yang korang dapat EZ-link
sticker batik ah ah yes yes ah backdrop dia punya backdrop
so nak kena kemas-kemas then after that terus dorang balik so dorang balik dorang letak benda and still nak kena keluar beli benda tau
so then it was three of us sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja thirty minutes ke apa later
terus google punya ni google no it was google ah google ah atau SIRI SIRI ada pakai iphone
don't say anything don't say anything tengah buat kerja
astaghfirullah astaghfirullah then after that terus balik ah imagine balik kul dua belas lebih daripada pasir ris
kau tahu kan the chalet we slept is tengah-tengah laut eh is at hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok pasir ris park
so like terus kita orang macam hmm that was the
scary experience pasal aku sendiri dengar I myself heard
that thing that beyond that macam aku kadang is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story yang aku tengok or was it just me but this one everyone heard and everyone was like macam
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then cepat-cepat ah habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu
but you don't seem like one aku nak tengok cerita hantu
for telegram ke
classroom yang mana which classroom
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the dia punya ni
mengundang kan mengundang
but those one of the stupid things korang buat lepas aku it was polytechnic punya time like it was during it was between kita orang punya from one class to another oh from one consultation to another consultation the session kalau tak salah eh
so macam daripada april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
then kita orang tengah tengok so from one class to another class is like three hours break pasal kita orang punya class straight so during that three hours we have our own lepak place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class ah tap to masuk
pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk so it became our macam hangout room for our course ah
so what happened was the dia punya laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai projector semua so kita have access to main cerita dia macam cupboard dia buka
dia yang buka the whole thing ah so kita buat
tak ada lah dia just pakai macam ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a macam he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa so
tak ada apa-apa lah so should be okay so kita tengok movie so like majority of us were in the class tengah tengok movie and
since dia is a glass door dia glass door kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita but then the glass door dia tutup dengan projector kau faham ah so kita facing projector belakang projector glass door kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok so like macam some of my classmate dorang tak nak duduk tengok movie dorang nak keluar or lepak with others the mix ah from different courses or just nak pergi lunch so one of aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap eh what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
seven eh bukan eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six umur yang twenty six yang buka cerita shaun the sheep kau faham tak so we were watching shaun the sheep abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa after that kita tengok cerita apa tau final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend yang shaun the sheep keluar dia masuk balik kan kita tengok final destination five dia macam wow you guys ah asal tengok one cerita to the other tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa but that was one of the best ni lah
and another best thing I yang kita orang pernah buat was
main hide and seek dekat airport
akak punya clique my clique dengan a few guys so time tu kita orang dah habis
I think sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal that day I think that day was
kita orang main terminal two kita orang main terminal two ah kita orang main hide and seek the thing is kita orang tak boleh hide dekat toilet ah pasal boys tak boleh masuk girls toilet girls tak boleh masuk but it was so fun
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play main hide and seek paling best
ah teman
kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram ah so during kita orang punya
secondary four secondary five kita pergi malaysia
tak lah no is different tak ada during our time tak ada such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate kita pergi overseas kita pergi malaysia and visit universities to macam kononnya future nak kenal-kenal ah universities luar singapore
so kita orang semua dapat bilik hotel okay lah actually ni cerita seram ah
so kita orang dapat bilik hotel so there are kita orang dibagi like our classes are being divided into three levels so example dia level seven eight nine so level seven semua guys
level nine semua girls
so macam guys punya room this thing is the guys room is sebelah depan girls room sebelah belakang
jauh daripada lift so you have to walk in like macam and my room is one of the last few room for that floor kita orang punya that level kita punya room last few
and kak mun was also on the same floor so kita dua bukan the type yang akan takut because we usually travel go hotel kan so macam benda ni tak akan occur unless before this kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room lah so time tu kita ada ada macam seminar sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya hall ah so aku dengan kak mun pun terlupa something so kita orang kena rush pergi bilik so kak mun dengan bilik aku sama level ah
so kita masuk terus time tu ada hall and it's a long way tau like macam ah the corridor macam panjang have to pass by around ten rooms
the room dia macam zig zag
so kak mun punya room is around seven aku punya room eleven tak salah
sama floor tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua sec five dua sec four dua sec five dua sec four dorang split macam gitu ah
terus aku tengok kak mun tengok each other lari masuk bilik letak benda lari
patah balik all the way
itu the worst experience
tak they dim the whole the very old school punya macam yellow light corridor and the carpet was red
most of the time aku akan pakai
oh ya that's why oh so actually mak aku cakap kan um vanilla extract have gelatin
but kan um mak aku cakap if you want find like vanilla extract atau vanilla essence
kau nak kena make sure dia tak ada gelatin cause most of their product have like gelatin inside
ya that time kau cakap kau nak bakekan aku brownies
so kau sudah bakekan haikal
but we're fine we no we just fight macam sekejap jer lah you know like ten minutes kind
no lah because most of them like I'm cranky but then my cranky is like main-main jer
but yesterday I saw you post about him then kau delete
why apasal kau delete
wait so dah dia ada motor
oh tapi dia rarely pakai motor
um takut tapi lama-lama macam sudah biasa
err spark eh eh sorry aku tak ingat ah dia punya motor semua
no it's either spark atau sniper
mana picnic
um okay maybe not friday since friday hari raya haji kan
okay kejap bila ah okay mostly
next week aku sekolah lah
this week aku tak sekolah next week aku sekolah
but aku tak akan sekolah on the thursday and friday sebab hari raya
ya next week oh eh alamak aku sekolah lah ya allah
okay hopefully nenek aku tak datang sebab she's coming today I think
aku takut she will stay until hari raya
then kau tahu ah kalau ada nenek aku kan macam a bit
eh can we try like um picnic dekat bonnet
they like decorate the place they put like tikar all
then dia bawa like bakul of makanan
ya but aku rasa kau punya kereta boleh ah sebab besar seh
kan habis kau just bawa kau punya
kau punya laptop then kita tengok netflix
wah shiok sia habis kau bawa cushion
ah someone actually ajak me to watch train to busan but then out of nowhere tak update
um tak ada slot then after aku macam okay lah sedih
then dia tak update macam okay ada place you know
then you know and then after that dia keluar dengan abang dia
kan banyak orang sia nak tengok like most of kawan aku semua nak tengok then aku macam
tengok ah siapa first come first serve dulu ah tanya aku
but then end up najrah tak update aku then aku macam okay tak apa lah
ada train to busan kat netflix tak
oh my god you should watch your name dekat anime
ya it's damn fun like it's damn sedih like serious like you will cry like legit cry cry
sebab aku tengok dua kali kan dua kali aku nangis tau
huda said it's damn good so I think you should watch ah aku
akan tengok after my english shows so ya I got a lot of shows ah to catch up on
eh fah jap kau cuba bau yang dia orang bagi yang virus shut out itu
you tengok apa bau
mm bau kau nampak yang benda warna biru dekat atas table tadi
oh maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
kau tahu oh wait
so um kau tahu aku kan
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
Zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu kan
tapi aku punya kan it's like we talk
apa inner soul kau
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
no oh my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
aku cakap like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange kan so aku cakap ah like um
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me ah macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay ah then end up aku dapat five points
I want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
kawan aku eh no huda's sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she oh cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go ah like try but then aku cakap like
cause I'm using hijab what so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
macam it's so pelik like ya but I really want sia
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is kan kalau kau eh
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so I think kalau kau sudah fly bangkok or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like eh just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume what eh you use tudung you know
like macam back to back
but kau pergi bangkok bila
mm aku
for temperature screener dia dekat bukit batok hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
kan pelik dia cakap like note kan dia cakap below like for the note they said um
tak ada aircon so like whoever like shortlisted
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
I never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
lah aircon tak ada biar like I don't want like I want I need
that time kan aku dapat okay someone I got
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then kan end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing eh it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it

and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
um hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text tau
err dia cakap hi yes err dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
um dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever lah I just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes I'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like

most of the time like they will only do like macam the important stuff
so kalau
cause zeko brother masuk kan most of the time dia
banyak free time
quite susah lah sebab they have to
but then lama-lama it's quite okay
it's the part yang after itu yang busy gila
he have to think about it lor like you know lagi dia sudah family strict
kau boleh imagine tak kalau ada family strict
then kalau after dia book out dia nak jumpa kau macam mana eh
mak aku finally okay not finally lah
mak aku sudah tahu yang aku sudah patah balik dengan zeko
um okay kau tahu yang the five hundred grant that singapore bagi kita tu
okay so actually kan zeko dapat
but then he have to give back sebab dia
okay itu zeko dia pergi bilang aisha like macam kau tahu macam member seh kau just bilang like about our problems
then after that itu tak apa then zeko sudah bayar like two days after yang dia dapat that notice
then after that kan mak aku cakap dengan aku
um okay cause we were talking about friends lah like aku cakap dengan mak aku
ma like why you like very macam
aku tak tahu like for me and sarah like we realize mak aku macam tutup one eye for aisha
and it's like annoying macam
okay whenever like we balik lambat okay so that time aku balik lambat like aku balik

then after that mak aku macam ya lah nak call dia sekarang
then ah then aku macam okay ah whatever then aku bilang sarah like
ya aku sot but then I think it was like my tone
bila aku balik rumah then because it was so annoying so after that saat um
after like five minutes or ten minutes later aisha balik
then aisha pergi masuk bilik dulu ah so aku kat luar so obviously aisha macam nak gossip gossip
um dia pergi bilang sarah
cakap um pasal mariam ah um mama cakap mariam biadap
itu pasal aku kena balik siang then sarah cakap
err apa yang kau merepek eh like curfew memang pukul satu apa yang kau nak salahkan mariam
which is true ah like apasal kau macam
cakap oh it's mariam fault now I have to go home
padahal just because I was rude like macam kau tahu curfew pukul satu like
kau fikir kau special sangat like you know macam boleh balik like any time
like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap err adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau
err sudah biadap balik lambat semua then itu pasal aisha nak kena balik
so but then aisha was like blaming me then aku macam like
oh ya then mak aku cakap tak lah like err aisha kan
macam okay so aisha's friend right is like macam
so aisha cakap like um eh mak aku cakap aisha punya kawan
um macam family tak ada family support that kind
so kita macam oh okay lah then mak aku cakap dengan aku err so yam kalau awak nak cari
kawan make sure yang baik-baik semua then after that mak aku cakap
so awak err zeko dia sudah bayar yang duit government
so aku dengan sarah macam tengok each other kita macam
like how you know then kita tanya mak aku ah how mama know
then she said ada lah mama ada spy
so aku sudah sot like I was damn pissed off lah I was like
ya then after that at first aku sudah bilang sarah aku cakap oh zeko kena bayar balik that five hundred
then after that sarah macam oh okay then after that out of nowhere mak aku tahu
then um dia cakap ah confirm aisha bilang
then mak aku cakap tak lah um mama tahu jer gitu like mama dengar so aku macam
uh huh padan muka dia like kan mama punya mulut sudah err masam eh masin
mm ah kan mama punya mulut masin like I already told her to not balik lambat or like
then bila aku sudah keluar semua err aisha texted me she said

um huh no lah mama kan ada spy you ask her lah
that you told mama about it then aku cakap um
tak then aku macam aku cakap tak bagus fitnah like anyhow only aku cakap gitu then dia cakap whatever lah
um apasal like mariam nak kena expose aku like
habis sarah pergi reply dia cakap
then after that aisha cakap ah like um like I don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that betul pe like story itu is zeko's story tapi apasal kau pergi bilang mama
habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
err habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then aisha say oh gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam I'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
and and one thing I don't like about aisha kan dia macam
like one time she macam she balik the she said um
apa tu oh she went out to eat with haziq like one of her friends ah yang pernah suka dia
then after dia cakap oh haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam huh tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then err satu kali oh tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
tadi I mean through text lah
then the tempat
apa eh
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat um atas ni kalau
converse kan nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name kan
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission tau
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if I see my shoes like this
sebab dia punya nike kan she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's mahal
then after that err dia cakap
err dia cakap I was airing it lah habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why mariam so rude then pada aku macam it's basic what it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau ah
habis after dia cakap dengan aku err okay lah so from now
err you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry what like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
um aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam ah whatever lah then err dia cakap dengan sarah I want to buy shoes so like
err mariam don't have to like nag then aku macam I won't nag if you don't
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed I was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use lah but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang lah aku boleh beli habis pergi lah beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
um how to say ah like macam
ya like macam these past few days ah like me and aisha we have like this tension then sarah satu kali
oo I sense tension then aku macam ha lah kau just stop
confirm nanti balik kan dia akan cakap aku err pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time I use her bag
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
she won't ask permission for her macam oh kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like I don't get it
aku penat sia rant pasal dia
far lah it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
um merry eh kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok tau dia pakai macam just
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang kan then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
malas nak go through ah the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu kan tapi dia swee swee jer seh
a'ah macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
swee swee tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah swee swee so like
aku cannot use thick socks I have to use like
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
berapa banyak doc mart ah kau ada
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie I know you
macam rare occasion
oh if I take one of your high waisted I can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
ya I think that one can match my baju because
okay I have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah um tali tau
so kalau aku pakai kan kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
ya dia bukan skinny dia um flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
ya because that baju since that time seh my mum buy but then I haven't use yet cause I cannot find like the correct
but then kau tahu aku perasan kan like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
eh baju you boleh nampak dalam kan baju you boleh nampak dalam kan
sekarang bila aku check baju kan aku really see macam
a'ah lah like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet kan
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape kan
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no lah orang like kau tahu sun ah kalau sunlight kan nampak obvious kan then aku macam tak apa ah like
boleh nampak sia like um inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic sia
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too
err macam how to say ah like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam kan
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai err what ah what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time kan aku punya button kan dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak sia kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
tapi itu nasib tak ada zeko sia kalau tak dia sudah macam cakap ah siapa suruh pakai baju ni
it's true because if you don't have strict parents right like your parents don't care like if you've matair
ya but then kau
the problem is about kau orang kau orang punya time and like macam parents dia pun quite strict
about matair
if tak strict aku rasa most of the time dia sudah ajak kau sudah datang like

but then zeko punya kan kita tak ada cube dekat U star
so kita pakai serbuk yang powder
so aku macam okay ah hopefully it's nice ah then
end up okay lah quite nice it's quite pedas

this macam channel of jobs itu semua and then she didn't reply
then you tak cakap apa-apa
at first I was like senangnya kerjanya like it's easy for like eighteen dollars per hour seh
I am contemplating whether to masuk dikir barat atau like err I don't know if anyone can added like this
itu macam something got to do with like choir the thing tapi it's not really choir but like macam
ya macam nyanyian ada yang menguar I don't know whether I want to nyanyi or not but I don't know where to find barat
like dia macam ah like
actually dia ada ada ah piano punya tau it say like uh I think is piano assemble carpenter and then I don't know if I if I want to masuk do I need to have like a piano punya experience or what atau I can just start from scratch
uh uh mestinya
I didn't know that ngee ann also got dikir barat
ya ke I don't know I thought was only like
have islam ni ke malay
bagus lah
esok err awak masuk see mostly
you know for the for the person you tak boleh
like honestly honesly speaking I don't mind leaving my parents gitu
mm baloi
your course boleh pergi which uni
but the thing is that like like for example macam hari raya if we cannot go back then a bit sad lah mm
no one in my family have gone to like belajar overseas before so like if I'm the first one to go it's gonna be freaking hectic at the airport
but still right one whole army datang sia confirm dia
can you imagine they everyday confirm everyday mesti kena video call like at least once confirm
but I feel that it's okay if if if the school like provide it feel like a dorm atau apartment like if you if you live in the dorm I think it's okay I think it's ya I think that one can like save a bit of money
but like you know you you have to know how to like behave yourself there are like you cannot be iman kau mesti kuat punya like your your spiritual self must be strong ya
like you me and iffa pergi at the same uni but different course I don't mind though right ya
iffa boleh iffa boleh masak actually
bico boleh buat kerja rumah macam vacuum jer she laju
okay aku tak suka suka baju ah aku tak suka basuh baju
oh jemur kain aku suka cuci baju jemur baju angkat baju suka lipat jer tak suka
pasal right lipat baju kan like I don't know like you have to be station there macam if if for example okay like you say you can tengok youtube and stuff right but I cannot I cannot concentrate kadang-kadang
like a suitable time that I want to lipat baju if like someone asked me to do it right I won't do it like I wouldn't have the mood to do it
oh but if like someone like macam tak suruh and then I just like you know voluntarily do it lah finally
oh you have you read about the news yang pasal yang yang orchard killing tu yang orchard tower well what do you feel about that
I I don't like I don't wanna be like racist ke apa lah but like is the fact like if let's say like kalau um our race yang buat
confirm kena punya kan like lebih rabak but I don't know lah I don't know what was the judge or the court was thinking
just just now I told my like I told my sister lah ya every time I see like the news like cakap pasal
I feel like okay lah like how many is is okay but then it reality actually is like quite serious eh like for example like if I'm in that person shouldn't like macam
like confirm it's a bit like severe pe kan the symptoms and everything and like for me to feel like all takde apa-apa lah like that kind of thing it's like a bit worrying though because I selalu nampak and then like you feel like macam day by day your
feeling towards it macam dah apa-apa jer lah
no I think one of the reason why it was because of the election yang kat sabah
fool ya dia lelaki actually know what to say
ya he said that he said that then I'm like like no even like ah is is not even two week tau and he already said that he dah he he baik already from COVID nineteen I'm like apa seh
no the thing the thing about you is that you still ada kind of like ada income from your small business honestly ya
ya like three more minutes just if I miss up then just aduh aku tak tutup pintu that's why
kalau aku giveaway
to think and then like accessories pun boleh pe

eh cause I scared if I tegur then suddenly
no depan lagi no depan lagi depan lagi depan lagi you know they have ever that kind of thing if you tegur and then the thing just follow you

so when they send to kallang all the way I walk home right I press the lift I look back I press the thing I look back I before before I go masuk ke rumah I look back because I scared

ya and then tempat then like got a lot of cuisine and then everything's halal and then like you don't have to worry
sebelah dia ada waffle
siot lah tak ada mood sia
ya but because I think like clifford tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh tempuh clifford kena tempuh like tau
ah tadi kerja macam mana
oo jadi
habis participants pun sikit ah
jadi dia orang bawa banyak duit ah kalau berapa banyak hari macam gitu
um jadi ah apa habis tapi tiga orang jer kan tadi
tadi dari um apa sektor
tak ada lah
tak tadi nenek tak pekik ah apa pagi dia terbangun then dia pekik sekejap lah sebab ini tapi biasa lah dia tak ada dia punya maki-maki hamun lah
then I think dia lapar biasa dia minta pergi toilet tapi dia tak minta solat solat lagi ah dia tak I think because dia nampak mak keluar pergi kerja kan jadi dia tahu dia seorang seorang dengan bibik jadi dia diam aje
um so entah um tak ada anxiety tak ada ah
tapi selalu panggil doktor lepas tu dia orang cakap apa pasal anxiety pill tu
I think err tapi is susah to say ah that this is still moderate like I mean moderate I think is kalau nak cakap apa um penyakit yang bila atau paling terhangat kan like you know heat at the peak right moderate lah is should say I think anything more than this um
I think anything more than this kena redha lah
compared to the past tiga hari lalu lah yang
tapi dia ni memang dari dulu selalu apa bila dia bila orang dekat dengan kita orang apa go nak pergi dia kan selalu at her top
um tak tak senang lah reckless lah lepas tu ah apa terkebil-kebil mata dia kan
tapi nenek timid timid kemarahan dia tahap singa
eh hari tu ambil test yang dapat test dementia tak
ah tapi macam mana sebab test dia kelakar kelakar tanya soalan kan
the dementia I pernah nampak ah like the test to do
um bila kita cakap pasal dementia kita pernah nampak test dia apa um dulu dekat tempat kerja sekarang kena buat dia tapi nama test abbreviated mental test or something
A&T kan then apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ I tell you the number one nine seven two
huh what is it ah actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already azan is it time to pray is you already azan then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
it is there's some like the guidelines to ah diagnose mental conditions susah like it is continuous assessment because ah apa
doctor cakap macam okay dah dia ni he show like five out ah like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then apa
doesn't mean just depression kadang-kadang kalau dia datang enam bulan later sekali I am very depressed but I can hear voices in my head telling me to jump down
ah tu dah schizophrenia tu but then you see is like mental condition is terlalu susah cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression dia ni oh dia ni dah tukar dah lain
just depression kadang-kadang datang enam bulan later sekali
tapi memang dah ada dah lama pun dia orang abandon yang dekat malaysia pun dia orang hantar apa mak dia orang sebab nursing home dekat situ lagi murah then but you cannot blame lah dia orang kerja apa mana ada orang ada time nak jaga mak bapa kat rumah it's like
tapi kalau kita tengok dalam islam kan macam mana
I think kalau you nak ikut yang orang europe punya is that kita first of all kita singapore tak ada space tapi kalau ada space kita boleh buat tapi dia orang buat dia orang tak buat nursing home dia orang buat macam nursing bilik you know
a nursing home right is very strict like you have to be inside there are because they don't have the manpower to bring you out and even if you can go out err is very risky because later nanti anak dia orang datang complain eh why you let my mother my father go out ah ah you know
mak bapa dia orang yang like oh people who stay at their already they also frustrated they also want to go out okay imagine it's like you've been living your life up the whole life in a certain way out of sudden your place in this new environment lepas tu dia orang macam you want to
quote and be be scold or something also like that right pun tak boleh because apa
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource kita punya apa kita ada is ah hasil kita is orang you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you know those uh I think last time your late aunty ah arwah tu dia duduk situ
you mean senior activities macam tu
but if you have to understand sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan I think banyak sangat orang nak literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
but um apa
macam that time yang for hundred dollar COVID fund tu orang ambil advantage
tu lah
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi temple nak pergi church
you ada that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty lah if the centre is really big
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk tapi for those yang habis bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so macam
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone tak tak semua orang nak karaoke tak semua orang nak colour tak semua orang nak main mahjong ada orang nak pergi church nak pergi solat you know nak pergi prayer nak pergi temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate um the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that dekat singapore is black kita neutral kan kita apa
um kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang
ah kita tak nak emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if tapi kita kena buat moderately kita tak boleh over of course lah kita tak nak extremist kan kita nak be good to our neighbours
it every individual tahap um how religious they are tahap dia punya iman it's more like eat in the bowl
so bila you nak bawa orang orang ni cakap okay ah siapa nak pergi mall nak buat you know macam kalau let's say dia orang taruk rental flat like one of the benefit atau studio apartment eh what are the benefit is boleh buat pergi church temple and
um mosque mosque this mosque lepas tu ah church let's say is a catholic church then ah
but I didn't tinggalkan dia seorang seorang
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like nenek dekat rumah
um how to say ah macam nenek kat rumah so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that um my elders is the one that come ah
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different dia punya um relationship is different so
macam mana nak cakap eh I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it mah so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
um I feel sad also macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak secondary school yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang because they are because they are the oldest one
then dia orang nak kena sacrifice nak kena pergi rumah nenek
apa ah for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think um the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
oh semalam ada cakap kan the discussion dari kecil is what is important how you didik and show right um
kalau you tunjuk dia orang that oh you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like alamak this is a task this is a task
ah because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore nanti macam tak happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
why didn't you do lah bila kita nak kena pergi
ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa oh cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend ajak me go out nak keluar oh sorry sorry tak boleh tak boleh need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me nenek dah kat rumah it convenient
ya it is a team effort macam mana dekat nursing home ada satu orang satu orang jer ada tiga orang
ya but so jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan like you all this tanya right dah tak cabaran lagi lah so it's just a learning experience
tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali in the future macam mana mak nak dijaga don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the syurga
is that you have to always selalu
be prepared to tukar mindset
tukar mindset
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh if metaphorically is if you put it in a
you can ah whatever makin turun makin turun kalau you tukar your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you patah balik patah balik right kadang-kadang like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is ah again ya and apa that sucks lah because
apa kita selalu um try our best too you oo kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu imagine eh kalau
and dia cakap lecturer dia is ah mak dia pun ada dementia she's the main caregiver lah okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a pakar a professional in these right in having patience and kesabaran cause they take care kan
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my kawan bilang me was that
uh okay lah dia because dia ada background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was um dia try her very very best untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing anywhere
bila nak berak kan dan kencing I rasa dia ada strategi lah macam every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue err bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia cannot help it kan dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or what lah but a professional who is teaching
it's like macam mana nak cakap eh ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you ni cuma you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family yang dah ada history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family tapi kalau family do decide that one day
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you selalu kena not not selalu kena actually you have to always be there what not what not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the terikut perangai lama jer perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but doktor macam as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give tapi like I
think I had one someone I know right um dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir lah apalah a'ah macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal ah but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu lah
untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar
jadi cerita dia macam ni mm
dia cerita dia macam ni lah like
dementia is you can um jaga because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but um it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because walaupun jaga dementia ke tak bila dah nak tua like mak cakap the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak so bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang
okay um I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya shopping ke I nak dengar pasal kak alin punya work ke nak dengar pasal kak alin punya wedding
tapi one of the macam
tapi no lah I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something lah for my bags or something
because I remember reading before dia orang kata can just keep
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips dekat dia orang punya zips covered kan in in like its original packaging kita tak buka so it's all just there abeh kita takut ah okay so I thought was safe
abeh I followed his wife macam a luxury person lah okay on instagram abeh dia ada macam Q&A session gitu sometimes abeh dia punya one of dia punya itu is um don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime abeh if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then um the humidity and also whatever whatever
ya so so I'm worried about it tapi kalau if I ask him to keluarkan
then tak oh my god tapi that time itu saya tengah because saya beli banyak benda kan then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because kakak dia belum keluarkan her clothes
so in that so ada a small section where I can put the stuff lah abeh
you know bila macam nak unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag ah macam all nice gitu kan so woohoo open it up
then tak enough space tau so long as it can I can you gerakkan your tempat baju sikit so that I can more space lepas itu dia how why you just taruh dekat atas lah then no nanti crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is kalau kak suruh dia like can you keluarkan this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
nanti dia just macam campak or whatever nanti semua like I don't know nanti macam crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why macam oh if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now kak punya kerja like
just nak duduk rumah ya
um because now dia apple boy he got a macbook
then when your contract ends kita sama tak mine is on february
tapi yours is the same kita sama plan kan ada abah
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think dia punya pun end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone ah
ya then macam all the other laptops macam will
ah then macam not bad ah then like ya macam
macam all the food that abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai seh
then dia okay lah then dia ya
no I just thought macam
I tak tahu I tahu macam when I hear macam the oh the android versus apple whatever macam android punya argument macam their specs is better
and like sea creams like sea cream pastels and dia macam you know that marshmallow and macam round gitu swirly gitu it literally looks at that considering the pathway is not
ah macam film theory
kan film theory on youtube kau dah tengok I feel like ada
I tak tahu fashion so back to the basic
ya cause I tak adventurous so saya tak adventurous
saya takut stick out
okay saya tak tahu ring so
the vibes eh the vibes get a little vaccine also hello it's just it's just tampal there anyway
aku tak tahu period aesthetic tau aesthetic kita tak ada the third eye aesthetic close
kita tak ada vibes kak ada I would say um FOMO
ah ah macam oh she looks nice let me copy that look
I have macam oh okay I like this I don't like that outfit ada lah but macam
it's not like oh I the whole genre of that outfit I suka
ya lah academia lah macam sweater um with like pleats and like straight cut pants
you know kak benda semua dekat my table black and pink
oh so kak limah macam on that scale kak limah macam on a six
I'm fine with that tapi dia end up with um macam best so been tested
um he's kinda like dia just not a nice guy
I don't remember if dia ada err actually I do I don't remember if dia ada err apa macam character change plot whatever what is it called ya character development I don't remember
ya macam huh asal dia ini ya actually all the guys in gossip girl boo humphrey boo they just macam oh oh it's me okay I don't fit in macam okay relax
zero number first affordable need archie bol something like that okay I get it macam kau kaya okay archipelago I teller I david archuleta
weird but no archuleta is doesn't he doesn't even sound macam atas
archie bol dia how to spell archie B O L oh
he's like in the upper class you know cause ya tak humphrey macam humpty dumpty you know he's in the dumps period serena serena van der would said okay she has she has european blood line okay
I mean I'm sure macam small characters lah but the main cast their white
dia macam oh my god brooklyn dekat a part of new york
so macam school high school ya dekat ya the show started dia orang high school that means it's high school season so by the time case dia orang dah kerja dia orang dah kerja some of them kahwin so
dah kahwin dah ah si chuck bass kahwin si blair waldorf si selena kahwin si dan ah I tahu dan lah he main the netflix you know the you the stalker that's dan and then selena is siapa nama selena eh
blake lively selena william selena wiliam sejak bila nak sama tak oh tersay then blair waldorf selena booked dia the waldorf brown hair ah siapa
there's two the main character I would say two girls and three guys two girls three guys ther's one more girl tapi dia macam I think
I was like tak salah lah at the end dia macam
um I at the actress some something and then dia macam tak so so present either like ending last season something like that the actress herself macam problematic something like like that lah dia macam dia macam indecisive punk life then dia macam I think so lah there were some like drama whatever contract tak ingat ah something something but
kalau if I remember correctly she wasn't macam so
I tak tahu I tak tahu dia nak pursue music something like that she had a rock band and that no she's blonde she's like super like platinum blonde and tapi dia ada pakai like eyeliner macam wow macam black the character also not nice
towards the end agaknya lah ya
anyway dia dan punya adik in the show
so there's three guys and then ya I think the two guys if I say the name you don't know who ya because dia orang after gossip girl dia orang tak so popular
no itu
skaters pretty liars ah no pretty liars tak ada boys actually ada boys but dia orang macam not
maybe I don't even know what the guys look like ada ada boys but dia orang macam not so

E wall oh I tak tahu lah mana aku tahu E wall iya
dia dengan the what's the girl's name ah
dia dengan fy dah berapa lama together
nothing much ah I tadi cause I got sekolah what
so it's just school from home ah sekarang
pay attention sikit sikit
but then cause my fridays free ah so I got nothing to do I thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
kat sana kerja dah punya lah senang
but then my rest also dorang bayar
but then dorang tak nak ambil cause I still schooling ah then they say like apa ni
aku actually boleh kerja sia
then gitu duit masuk so senang ah but then wasted lah I never think of it lah
dah lama ah tak makan sana because like
diam sudah no ah I mean like
but hijrah barang lama ah now the people there all
faiz faiz lagi extreme no I think faiz is like the epitome of extreme you know
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if I go gym all ah
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya ah
but gym just very intimidating ah like aku rasa macam
seram ah like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
but like if you see orang gemuk kan orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua pe
I don't know ah later people kat gym tengok like eh try hard pe this guy
forever sia macam gini
at least I looked proportionate ah like don't look so bulat
then these days I want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery ah for the
no not really after ah after still got a lot of outfields semua pe so we still keluar banyak-banyak
makan banyak ah cause of
then it's cause of ah always order in asyik beli jer then sekali
dah getting rounder ah
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
rumah ella kat mana eh oh ya ya ya correct correct correct
uh uh rumah ella
kat belakang ah
like from rumah ella you walk to tracks
then there's a coffee shop there ah Fatty Bom Bom kat sana
eh it doesn't make sense leh I mean like okay like kau tahu uh
but then in this case like abang gemuk and Fatty Bom Bom no difference what both halal already what
so like they tukar nama for what sia
that time also ada ah
so like like when I go lia's house senang ah
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes sampai ah
uh kau tahu dunman sec kat mana
ah dekat ah
malas pe dah cakap malas nak exercise
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
ya but like macam
confirm malas sia nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
but that one tengok ah kalau
if only kalau ada discount ah
uh then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that lah
I never try abang gemuk before ah so cannot say ah
but a bit mahal ah that day I eat it's like six ninety
pasal dorang dorang bagi banyak ah
tak tapi even though the portion worth kan but I feel like it's like two people portion ah
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
but over there they give the full bowl ah then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
I think new ah the shop dulu takde ah
I don't really remember ah because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
I play public game like macam
always kena thrashed ah
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental lah
I don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh sia
like it's more to like main sendiri
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do ah
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu ah
better than runescape ah tapi
like kau kena tunggu ah resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
console pun ada
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales ah they spent banyak ah
dude gila like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
like empat ribu lima ribu
so it's like really luck based ah tengok ah your luck macam mana
pernah pernah ah ah last time I buy the skin
so macam I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like lima belas eh
wasteful ah spend duit kat game
ada ah additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat ah like you need like
so tak rasa sangat
uh uh kau macam tak you like don't know me like that ah
hmm sejak bila
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
a'ah tapi tapi bola macam
like I book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama sia
tapi tak dapat ah
since the booking start I never I never kena dapat I think cause I always book late ah
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up kan then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot ah
then uh aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
a'ah so other people can get ah but some more aku selalu tak dapat ah
tak tahu ah
tak nak ah
tengok kerusi all
uh and streamers uh aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini ah Secret Lab one
asal mahal sangat sia it's just a chair right
tak ah tapi tapi even though
it's leather you know leather actually murah seh
tak tahu ah
I mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar kan
sama ah
I mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
kau ambil pisau kau potong seh already
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah kan Coke
that time that time siapa eh tunjuk aku uh I think
achap ah achap tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai Coke
untuk cuci toilet
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks ah like even time hari raya kan
uh okay usually guest just eh uh tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang kan
my my nenek punya side more of Coke ah so they got like
then another container is all just uh apa ni F&N
ya hari raya
so if I go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea gitu
apa eh the other one yang ah the hijau one the hijau one sedap ah
tak tapi the best one I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but susah ah nak cari like everywhere I go like most most kedai tak jual ah
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour one
but sekarang susah nak cari I think they stopped production already ah I haven't I haven't seen it
takde takde takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
I think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so lup sup you know
macam repeat
then macam
tak ah tapi sekarang not that bad because like
but then eh you got lobang for kerja or not
I don't know ah like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
yang sebelah yang sebelah Hard Rock Cafe
ya cause uh my friend from dulu kerja
uh like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu ah wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
but dorang punya is more for ini kan is like
like apa ni concerts semua kan
kat Shangri-La that that type
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang ah
kerja senang ah tak yah buat banyak sangat ah
oh ya but Marche tak halal lah
eh jangan gini ah
berbual really like proper english punya you know and like
a bit more to the mahal side ah
then dia dapat banyak apa ni
uh banyak freebies semua
but then dia kira balik kan actually what he paid for
but I heard the cakes there good ah the the kuih lapis cake ah
should try ah should try go there makan
can ajak C what
eh eh you tell her first ah eh I'm not gonna pay for you mm bayar sendiri
muka sedih ugh
I I I think nanti aku re-watch ah
I think it's like a company just uh macam get all these people kan
then dorang buat macam a short video macam as a skit
kau imagine macam
macam key and peele
okay ah tapi no matter how many times I re-watch eh
kekek gila ah I will still laugh and laugh and laugh ah
like semalam semalam adik aku main the
key and peele yang mana eh
what apa what's name eh
asal achap tak leh
I thought and him best friend already just now talk on Discord macam
macam brother eh
nanti nanti nanti there he he sniff all our cigarettes sia
tengok ah nanti I play for fun ah
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish kan
oh uh kira kan macam halo kind of graphic ah
busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell eh
I don't know ah like semua orang like rebut nak beli P eh actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console lah
ada ah main ah
like when I go to my apa ni cousin's house
aku dari dulu kan like
my parents macam
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
dorang like cakap okay uh haris uh
kau main twenty minutes
my father ah my father cakap like eh haris uh okay ah
suddenly like everyone kat uh kat luar then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
eh cik if you want to buy game boy
dah ah tak ah tak yah panggil gemuk pe
the once the slim one come out semua beli ah
I think it's cause it's different lah like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
just want to show off features ah ada dual screen kind of
no but Switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
but quite popular what aku tengok banyak orang sia main
tak pernah ah
oh okay okay faham faham ya
until now I I looking to play it again you know but tak leh jumpa ah it's called what is it called eh uh
total war tak pernah ah
ya apa eh got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro yang
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
apa ah nama dia
oh oh is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
I never see before ah ipin I only see him post punya video ah
for one hero no cause in is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak kan
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak ah
ya for other country is by state so like johor macam johor will be
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
okay ah for me I find it interesting also but I not so into it sampai
so macam like the
malay heritage semua kan dia tahu ah
the different type of culture semua
quite cool eh actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
they control like the whole trade route semua
now semua
what what you want to makan
kau tengok Guga Foods ah
like with the with the what do you call that the onions semua
eh but guga he got his own ini sia industrial size tempat masak grill
at in his home there's like a restaurant punya size punya grill
no ah I think they slowly ini ah
purchase like I think they see it as macam business purchase gitu
cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel what in the end
so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff lah like his knife semua bagus punya all like
ah ya ya ya correct correct they buy dia beli the knife from like macam garage sale like that
ah ya the rust out semua
but then yang ini okay ah yang you know those kanjiro kind
uh huh tak kan ah dorang jual
then is dorang jual like legit kira kan like boleh potong orang punya
that one quite ni ah he but that guy keluar kan samurai sword ah
to potong someone
and lastly err the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world sebab bila you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good ah when you can do things yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat
mm pasal ilmu ni but dia ada banyak err rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi hmm kalau dapat ni best ah pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat mm and bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni mm
so ini adalah yang tiga wishes yang saya nak mm so kita err what about you fathul
pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh spend on whatever and what not and bila awak dapat spend whatever and what not then means err with every spending awak akan rasa this happiness
kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang teleport ke tempat lain so dia jadi the source of this err kuman lah so dia yang spread to others
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus mm so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
okay mungkin awak dah cakap ini okay maybe saya agree sikit
maybe awak ada point over there
tapi yang contact tracing tu mungkin tak tak senangkan lah
pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia teleport kalau dia sendiri dah suka teleport
mm tapi ini interesting point of view mm so kalau awak tanya saya apa superpower yang saya nak saya nak power of regeneration
so contohnya err jari saya terpotong ah nanti dia akan heal sendiri
saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki dislocate ah dia regenerate sendiri
dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak kan nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang high risk
itu meminta kematian lah
think of living in isolation uh maybe one maybe satu hari bila dah dah experienced everything yang kita nak ah
okay mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya and betul lah yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena
sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
so for example bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong so kita akan mencari solution untuk menolong seseorang itu
so mungkin apa awak cakap err betul juga ah and tapi bila awak err saya
hmm hairan lah kenapa awak err question bila seseorang itu nak isolate maybe for months
his child behind then anak-anak dia akan merana ah and
kalau months okay months maybe saya rasa maksimum err maybe not more than nine months ah
lesser than that mungkin okay
kenapa nine months sebab within this nine months um budak tu dia akan grow and after this nine months
okay soalan tu interesting sepuluh tahun means sebelas tahun yang lalu
sebelas tahun yang lalu okay saya definitely akan suruh diri saya err ini ah invest ah invest in bitcoin
sebab at umur ten years old memang awak cakap betul uh nak nak faham tentang certain barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat convince ah
satu orang ni at ten years old dia akan ingat
and maybe along the way mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas and then dia akan start
err thinking back err apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak
ah adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya ten years bila saya ten-year-old akan betul
so mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan err um akan interest awak ah pasal maybe one day juga awak akan jadi famous because of this ah
err some luck you managed to stay alive ah so for you err apa yang experience awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian
I need to add on apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati
it happens whereby we have to train where err train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so kita orang kena capsize habis tu bila capsize ini kita kena grab kawan kita punya kayak
and get back up ah so bila saya tengah practice capsize ini

kau went over and ask for apa yang tu err
apa yang kau pergi minta err bidan then dia orang bilang engkau suruh ambil err hairdressing kan
to think balik
you know at least kau sudah
walaupun macam kau think balik now now kau think balik err whatever that kau err going through
before kau tak ada kerja and then kau tengah
kau dapat that skills err future now kau sudah ada that that sudah ada that skill the only thing kau want to progress
but um do you think macam you have gone you think kau sudah pergi quite far juga eh
berapa tahun eh semua kau dah berapa tahun agak-agak kau ah gunting eh
oh semua ini satu tahun saja
oh daripada two thousand and nineteen
tapi kau suka juga ke I mean sekarang ni kau dah come to a point yang macam kau
find it macam dah terlalu err repetitive ah kan
mm habis kalau kau
if you are given a chance untuk um
sound engineer atau gunting rambut
eh the other day kau pergi err airport
dengan anak kau eh semua birthday eh
oh oh she went out dengan your folk your folk ah
kau kau ada ini tak bagi tahu dia yang err aku send regards

degil which is kan bagus ah ke tak degil degil dia ke tak
ada lah ada that's err it's been quite awhile man
it's been quite awhile geng pasal ya um
err you know lah pasal
COVID you know err I think the last one kita met was probably before
COVID right it was uh kau datang sini um
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
mm lama ah about diam tak diam dah
ah dah enam bulan ah
so ya tapi dah oh no dengan ayah tu is probably when uh farhan ah
kita nak work on lagu farhan ya
aku kind of tengah
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya err aku punya life
I've now baru start main bicycle err aku baru beli bicycle err a cruiser
err aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
err other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
aku been doing a lot of err things kat
err nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is err ah tapi
aku rasa tenang ah macam biasa ah
tenang ah so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
but paling boring is err tak dapat pergi err seberang tambak ah
itu yang paling boring ah pada aku for the past six months ini
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
ah aku suppose I think err I think err dia bukan
ah maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
I guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
I mean time sekolah kita kan dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
err main
main tangkap spider at some point of time kan kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
err bila mm jumpa kawan
ah nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk um beriadah ah
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
err youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
ah and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this um
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
um tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
ah so aku rasa
it's good juga ah
but err kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
but not just aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just err cycling tahu
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
uh explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam ah not just bab makan jer
ya I mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada lah semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang err
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the tahu
macam kira park connector punya
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku ah
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
oh and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
err aku from hougang going to bukit batok um go through macam
and you err you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada um
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat buona vista
from buona vista all the way pergi bukit batok how's ah
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
ah was it macam dah start dekat uh east area boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
I mean kau kau dah pergi ah juga tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak jer
oh so sudah sudah kau sudah use that lah dekat
then daripada daripada uh
tampines to bedok ada you think
for now kau dah nampak yang tampines to pasir ris
hougang betul tak baru dia come dia come in right
look at that macam
eh kau err ini hari tak buat apa-apa ke sia
macam apa selalu kau buat on saturday
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
mm dia orang you know they they they they they even like
like now kan macam
go back in time tak
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
tak ah I mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
tak mandi err would would find themselves
it's actually bukan rabak ah punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang penyakit yang tak familiar ah but you have that you know
huh it's not it's not a bad punya ini lah maksud aku macam kadang-kadang kan macam
ada orang uh tak boleh main dekat
err tak boleh main dekat rumput
ada so itu penyakit
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's um
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa um
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai err
tak sedap ah you know tak sedap badan
tak lah tak lah pasal aku aku just wonder lah pasal kadang-kadang kan kenapa aku cakap east coast kan randomly juga pasal kan
err ya lah all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni kan semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause I guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang um tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta um
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam you know
pagi pagi jer dah sian macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain lah tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know um senang sikit kan
macam ataupun macam tak overnight lah you know grab or what not
so ya lah and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam um
err exploration ini semua kan macam as kita grow
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang uh a cycle eh
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
err reaching kau punya four digits
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat COVID tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
um went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie eh kita cakap macam
macam that kind ah lepas tu sekali macam
macam eh eh eh eh eh
open ah lepas tu macam eh
boy ah open ah itu macam that kind of thing ah
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun kan
kan that first few weeks kan at least a month tak keluar kan
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak kan yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
ah aku was having so much err banyak banyak um
kind of macam err slowly slowly became macam
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before ah but I really did ah
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku eh
but ya lah it was really funny that aku err ada that phase ah
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat eh
mm I mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big um
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku ah
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
err during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
I think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
during err apa err
during err circuit breaker punya time pun I think um
I did walk around lah macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing ah macam
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul you can change you punya
crazy also juga kan
so ya lah but still pun
ah the effect and I just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on lah but I guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa ah you know
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more ah
kerja ah it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's err more of err
tapi it's not the war of bombing lah gitu
it's macam um
macam um
it's macam
a smooth war ah you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam

running the whole thing nak type password dah you know when you type your full password then it takes a few second before the password starts to appear ah then
that cleaner equipment last longer blah blah blah but I don't know how my little brother pakai you know go to school carry here carry there sometimes go to

takde tak I I I've seen the
english punya league
cam the championship league one league two blah blah blah blah blah you know
ye from national then north south
which is on the same path they still have below and below and below ada below what the heck I think I think it's
regulate themselves dissolve all the useless clubs cause I think it's too much imagine kalau you know
singapore ada
S league delta league don't know what actually kita ada lah that is why the government decide to dissolve
I mean ya lah I mean that macam adik aku every
every night ah dia ah he come back from his camp army camp nanti around
maybe six plus dia makan by seven he will be out
dengan member member dia uh kat bawah block
then main bola sampai pukul sepuluh balik
so everyday like this but he's not gonna tell us lah whether he he play in league ke he play in what nonsense ah cause
he has to play football I think it's not no longer fun anymore ah abeh takkan takkan seh eh
nak main bola like every single day at this certain time wearing this certain jersey with certain boot I think it's a bit
whatever it is ah but there's a lot of african kid who's buncit so I can relate
year one eh kena okay anyway ah
seven years that's lama pe aku poly
bankrupt aku wait wait wait
tahun empat tahun pastu ah enam enam years ah I haven't been playing football actually lama pe

takde time you want to sleep more then work
spartan the hello universe but then if they are just standing down there looking at itik ayam kambing

then mati ah tak boleh berbual ah
but ah ye lah true
when old people ask us eh dah kahwin eh dah ni dah tu you answer also they are not gonna listen pe they just gonna keep asking whatever we talk they just talk pe unless you want to
wait wait and he and he said multiple times dia tak nak interrupt us he don't want to he pe he just over here he don't want interrupt us
aku nampak dia minum tu kat bawah sini pasal you know why or not you know why or not
dia tinggal tingkat lapan that time that time aku that time aku nampak dia keluar nasib aku pakai mask dengan topi sia you know
then he look at me he and he ask me nak pergi tingkat mana hello I mean I'm not trying to be rude or anything
there's a very high chance I'm not judging I'm not judgemental ke apa benda
I mean technically asu pe asu terperanjat lah that you
you came in a very quiet manner cause there's is kau datang awkward sia
time ke
time aku asal ah kau datang
macam if you're just being stuck here I mean you know how it feels pe to be stuck at home
like there's no purpose at least kalau kau you know kau gi kerja there is a purpose I in life
do you think do you think dorang will
the other side will be like uh oh no I want this one ah eh you cannot I plan already mah so it's like that you end up quarrelling for nothing just before husband and wife so this this so I don't want so when you think eh want to get married it's not going to be uh sudden just that are you okay if you want to get married to me then after that we plan later lah nanti dulu berbual so sekarang kita go dulu then kalau later part then we can plan lepas tu buat plan K uh getting a house settle down where to stay maybe mother mother's in-law side or your mother's side you see or not sometime you get married you got no house mah
so that's for me it's very simple I don't like macam you know lah to me a rocket go to the moon how to plan that thing no need no need no need no no no no I'm not I'm not very detail so as long as happy to see
yang kat mana where at where
why because it really trigger my nerve you know what when you want to do kad jemputan it's a wedding card ah eh so when want to do kad jemputan it's like

that guy flew it's very uh macam yang macam dia dah enal lama ah but alhamdulillah macam he can talk to me we are not awkward all the time ya that's the that's the best part of him ah there are also not not like uh apa uh retrovert eh
in okay so I was not like macam pendiam or what something like that so
I talk to him macam
macam dah kenal lama ah ya correct that guy is is is is cool
that guy is cool very very cheerful funny guy ya better than I think that's better than our last time yang yang supposed to be there right ya
we are maybe kita nak buat lagi ah
I think better we do because maybe that time macam tak prepare and by the way yang pasal kahwin ni video ni ya of course but we can make it one more round just for a video of us lah better kan
ada kat google my I think I'm my punya google photo ada berapa banyak gambar kita all this you can make it uh as a oh ya ya ya yes
the wedding eh okay the wedding regret tak pasal I as a guy guy's side eh wedding is just dia macam slide tau
they have no bumpy ride you know no need to engage gear apa gear sekarang we just like cukup time habis kita tak ada macam apa eh eh uh kita punya tanjak okay tak kita punya keris senget tak tak ada tak ada tak ada we don't we just cukup time
halal that is what I want dia tak ada macam eh
kasut kasut ketat tak tak ada tak ada tak ada I don't I don't I don't have think of that cause that time for
tak payah fikir sangat ya
the best part dia punya hari tak hujan tu jer for me it's the weather ah for me for it uh dia punya for me is the weather I cuaca dia yes correct
macam dia tak susah nak dapat tu weather that time out of what january eh month of january right dia dia macam tak nak kata panas tak boleh tau pasal I'm very stable outdoor tau dia kat luar
uh okay tempat dia okay just under void deck juga kan uh kita ambil kat void deck kita book void deck so kita plan nak booking void deck malaysia dia tak ada ada ada orang book kan they're taking up other events something like that it's very dia punya port dah okay tau so one thing's uh kita dah book then apa lagi
about the ada ada water utilities right you have to go something like that and everything uh under under that lah so make sure yang siapa yang nak kahwin uh kat you know void deck ke apa kan make sure you do your planning well I'm talking about the place ah ya
kan oh really kenapa eh
kenapa eh
for how many pack berapa orang dia eh okay
oh macam the brides woman jadi batman eh
mm lima puluh eh oh tak I think dua
three tiga tu tiga oh tiga eh uh first mm
slow down the process macam macam mana
maybe along the way they boleh buat photoshoot kan dalam kereta ke apa something like that tak eh
selit sikit lah tak ada selit
oh why kenapa
actually yang pasal your makcik tu dia memang cari pasal lah ya correct why why kenapa dia buat kenapa dia nak cakap macam tu kat depan mak you kan habis what your mum apa ada dua anak jer patut kena cakap balik
oh apa asal ha a bit
okay wedding eh kena uh nak uh apa uh dia dengan kompang tu
kan that time wow that time I macam ada crusader datang tapi tu semua dah plan lah so I cannot use my proceed kompang macam macam lain-lain team pula kalau tak I smile I tak ada uh plan but it goes well
sometimes it doesn't plan well it doesn't plan before but it goes well so it's like it's like macam cool lah eh tak tak
tak cakap pun ni semua jadi sendiri eh I was like happy ah my brother was there uh my adik was there with me dia dia yang plan macam mana dia punya line up so I was uh wow that's my first time tau I tak macam prepare all this eh asal my brother know ah ah that time ya brothers are quite okay lah my best man there that time
okay so uh kompang the the luckiest I mean the best part is the kompang weather and I also uh when I came to the pelamin then I saw you there sitting
then uh that's where I meet my wife and mak andam dia cover muka dia everything like that something like that tapi ada ada hadang eh
quite fun lah but that time tak ada macam rabak punya pakai apa uh padlock ke apa nak pecahkan kunci tak ada ah but just that dia very straightforward yes
and dapat tahu siapa more yang I dah kenal kenal lah yang tak kenal tu uh kat sana baru kenal tahu macam eh quite cool juga eh I mean of course the yang paling bising pun ada
of course they are part I think I think I think your family side is the loudest and have had have more uh fun there ah quite lucky you know actually it's throughout is the families getting to know each other I mean mak dia also apa welcoming me as a new guy in the family ya
tapi kita tak boleh buat like second round dua round tiga round tak boleh the best part
talking about the ballroom let's say ah you want to go to the what orange ballroom kita tak boleh makan ke
dah jalan dah kahwin if can rewind something like that ya
okay I first thing is sad one thing is happy okay the sad part the the wedding is over and it turn actually it turn out well lah okay and dia tak ada macam problem macam power trip ke apa tak ada it just went well so the event
dah habis kan so kita dah
dah apa dah stand down everything then
not say happy but I'm very like macam uh conscious ah what where to step everything it's not like macam wah this another episode it must be a difficulty at anywhere and at any corner will come
so what I'm I'm telling myself okay so kita then I think banyak tengok movie ah or drama orang-orang kahwin semua macam ni everything macam mana how dia dia dia plan dia rely on everything so nak recalled that back dia then kena ikut cerita apa dah jadi movie or drama dia jadi you know but I want to be my own drama
I want to be my own so I cannot tell them eh apa nak buat next ah siapa nak tanya my father or my mother or wherever yang dah pernah kahwin eh apa nak buat next ah it's like kental ah so I'm a man now I don't care so now you got own you got own way so you have it's a fun life ah
whether you what you want it to be so you nak macam mana you just create yourself until now I'm still creating so as a husband I as a husband
I'm talking for myself right uh I want to be very thrill I mean not really straight ah kadang-kadang corner a bit so you know ah you know the road well dia tak ada macam uh always straight jer ada ya lah kadang-kadang kita straight pun
boring apa straight road mesti ada corner left a bit sharp turn all these ah play along lah so how you handle okay first thing
uh that is me I cannot handle my wife if you if you can't handle me what I mean myself so this what I'm trying to say that kita if you handle myself unless you can handle anyone else so it's like that
so dah kahwin then uh ya then I rest at home
okay then don't play play anymore tak boleh macam berfoya-foya something like macam uh go anyhow and then I ask permission for my wife pasal kita dah kahwin sekarang kita tak boleh macam hanky-panky dulu bujang lain tak apa
we lepak bawah bawah block apa semua mak mak tak kisah so mak abah semua tak ali bila nak balik uh kau layan phone jer sekarang kalau wife lain tau dia tanya on the spot nak kena respond
dua missed call game
kiranya macam you're asking for trouble lah I know something will break or what itu eh wife punya side but dulu tak ah so this what is a discipline ah so you have to be more not say matured more discipline and care your wife be accompany with her so that everything goes well actually when I think ah
the more I care about my wife eh the more things I get you know like macam you there's something you return well lah something you don't know what is that but something you return you return well just nicely macam tak cakap dia dah fikir dulu tau ah something like that something like that if you if you think that way ah for me lah now right now that's one thing I like about her
if you give in she will also give back so fair lah ah for me it's fair if you now I don't have any like lepak dengan kawan tau dia tak macam call turun lepak lima lima empat pagi unless work lah unless work tu pun nasib dia punya
so ada lah sikit
uh not dia tak sama tapi serupa lah okay so pasal uh travelling eh okay start from travelling okay I as in start from our honeymoon lah the that is the starting of we how we can be linked
so there's no other dia tak ada pergi tempat lain tau macam long distance that time nak go mana ah pergi mana cambodia eh huh that time was the last time so I don't know that passport dah habis pasal I not a travelling guy
so bila part nak pergi honeymoon tu I using that passport lah yang lama tu then sampai airport
that time I thought my wife eh then kita baru kahwin kan so I thought she will get angry and shocked the whole airport can hear her voice but she relax already
dia tak marah dia just cakap aja alamak it's just I know that she's very disappointed you know
tapi dia tak expose dia punya marah tu kat airport so we plan that was macam I literally divert tau pergi malaysia
and then at malaysia passport I my passport lepas so dia kata can pass through ah my wife pergi book every yang mana yang nak pergi so that part eh she really a hardcore dia boleh book
so kita pergi mana dulu ah cameron highland first baru drop to cameron highland and port dickson so meaning we go three places lah eh under under malaysia state
I quite weird we having fun there lah it took part it's not it's not about malaysia you know it's the how we make that happen until now that's the best somehow eh kita nak pergi ah somewhere like macam uh korea ke itu kita plan apa kita nak plan plan plan sampai pergi tapi ini tak tau dia nak pergi bandung dulu nak pergi bandung then airport uh then passport dia habis uh mati then lepas tu kita dapat tahu kita pergi tempat lain and that was not planned
mm so kita ramp
that time so I have to drive lah so then I think my wife my wife should realise lah until now eh I'm a good driver not punishment it's just that dia tahu tau eh my husband can you know something not something fall
someone can can bring up back macam I tak cakap eh awak I cannot drive lah malam ni
no no no no I will fork out I will fork out something you've resolved eh macam
masuk mati ke I've tried to make something better lah so that's why my driving skill come in about that time dia dah I dah drive dah berapa kali ah eh
so I got you're saying that I I I I got uh someone that yang macam
travels dengan parents tak ada boyfriend ya you see eh you can hear that or not tak ada boyfriend that will make I'm the guy okay so
so something lesson learned lah sometime kalau kita pergi bandung pun it's a one way trip dia tak pergi mana-mana tempat pun whereas kalau kat malaysia ni kita pergi macam
a few places lah banyak oh ada juga eh oh
by okay by the way kan uh insyaallah kalau abang you ada duduk sana all right
dia punya menyesal tu takde lah
pasal I I choose this what
so how you can say regret no no no no not not really lah if something like macam benda yang eh kalau tahu buat ni takde takde it just went well if I plan if I say that now
if I know I being I do that now macam sekarang kan baru nak menyesal then we're going backward
so tu yang best lah macam
marriage sekarang ni ke apa oh okay
of course kan masa tu berselerak lah
I I scared I takut bila kalau my wife dia
uh suruh buat ni suruh buat tu uh tak boleh tidur rumah I tak tengok mak I something like that lah kena very like macam doesn't goes well lah once ada ah I don't like kadang-kadang kan ada orang kahwin dia straightaway eh
kat dia punya in-law jer
I don't know mungkin dia takde can nak tengok adik sendiri for me I I don't have that my wife give me freedom to go play especially
see my wife jalan-jalan makan dengan dia orang semua ya my wife is very fair very fair so we have this uh fairness lah ha so vice versa if for me kalau apa yang dia buat tu tak salah kan dalam segi undang-undang and dengan undang-undang agama then why not just try lah so try something new cause dia try something new ni kadang-kadang dia tak boleh macam
macam lama punya style jer so kita nak kena understand kita dah apa dah zaman ni sekarang kan zaman sekarang ni kita
a lot of things all or way we can uh do business ke apa ke so you have to try it out
bersyukur sekarang ni dah dia punya takde macam apa selisih faham lah
try to be more okay dia I think ah okay my wife dia nak ambil lesen tau okay I know this lesson we will take one or two years maybe or months only but
kalau dia drive tu I think she can bring me anywhere lah might be it's her turn after five years I bring eh another five years is her turn lah
dia punya turn so hopefully kalau dia dapat drive kan untuk suami suami dia ni yang very cute ni also cute you know I'm very cute also and of course ah ya so hopefully that's my request mah and drive me anywhere
I like I like her cooking until now no failure especially my recipes I just left my recipes recently there's I just finish ah so she cook for me every night shift so that's the best part day shift pun sama yes
I like her cooking actually uh she can cook well better than me ah that part I cannot take ah they cannot part they cannot challenge thank you sayang
