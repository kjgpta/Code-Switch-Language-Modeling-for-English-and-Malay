I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days ah like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and err the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so given that nowadays phones they uh they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me ah I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about oh no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about johor do you remember going to johor
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old johor house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old johor house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
mmhmm now the closest to johor we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there ah
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at uh pulau ubin what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so um what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
mmhmm
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to bugis like literally a five minute walk to bugis if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to bintan
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said oh we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like ah we're choosing to go to hong-kong oh why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies
was simpler so there there got so I can just gonna sleep now so

before the what
oh that one that one we haven't plan yet
but knowing angah I think he wants to eat
aww this one is nice
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel eh
because the Amara hotel what what my uh what I
thought that I
err should do right
is I will take two separate room
at least they can spend the night together
there
oh they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay lah
let's see the photos
Amara
huh got no plate
Maggi
because like how mah want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay lah ilham can sleep outside
ya
this one oh okay dah I think this is the one that I wanted to take
angah don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
okay this one is for three adults right
they can sleep
on the floor lah of course lah with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that lah as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
is it
mm
mm
mmhmm
that sounds fun
can consider
or the another one is this one also Ascott oh the price oh my god
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
mm
oh when are we receiving that ah
ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age
oh ya hor
mm)(mm)(mm
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward lah but I think he
I think he don't mind
no eh ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why ah why you don't like it
oh is it
what did you have
a a what
oh
mm okay lah I will decide
oh ya ya ya
mm
I also have it every month
on the itinerary
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that um indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
is like a bit weird lah so when I taste it eh I thought that it's going to be bad but then like oh my god it's so nice
err I ate the prawn green curry you the naan
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we uh we
mm it's too loud mm
because we we passed by and then after that we thought eh
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay lah
and then I don't really like udon
that's why maybe I don't mm
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
err okay lah I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like uh
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar tau for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
naan
okay lah it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay wow I I I don't ever have
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
mm mm mm
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm
ya
mm
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in bali remember the the Yoshinoya
the yakiniku beef
is it the same thing
ah
but then that one the one that I ate also called yakiniku beef why
oh wait
maybe maybe maybe
oh is it
mm
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose mee soto
oh okay
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know what
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like um
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it lah
of course right
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
oh but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity ah rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like oh my god oh my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the wayi can just like err can I
ya can I just like err take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
err helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room uh house is like seven million
err with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets err attached uh with uh indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
scary siol
I don't think I can
don't ah
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
ugh
mmhmm
and then they put there as a meme
okay oh ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
buy one get one free
oh you mean like okay okay I don't know
hmm
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
ah okay then that kind of deal like okay lah meh I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay lah maybe that one is a bit worse
like huh one for one
but I don't get to choose
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
standard lah
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body ah
ha
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like ugh
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like uh
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things lah maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
err
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients eh no no no uh like he or she is not wrong
and everything like that and then
ah I like like ya I like uh true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news oh I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are um
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
uh or like paranormal activity all these like
um uh cable uh ya
a good movie correct
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
err ya ya ya
ya
mm
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what ah
ah chris watts ah is it the chris watts
the one that she the one that the the
ya the one that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
um
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can uh on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay lah maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix one eh
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
uh I mean he's a narcissist what uh eventually he will just gonna act that oh no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
about two months prior prior to the wedding eh prior to the murder sorry
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
err the girlfriend lah but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious lah
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like um
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle lah like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like uh grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the one that
I had after I had
aryan after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
uh healthy okay lah healthy is subjective lah
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
this
take care of you when you are young kan so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
err they need I have to
do it
for them
ah and then my third wish actually
uh I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still uh I'm already pretty
oh I
err when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
err uh um lower secondary
then I think
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head kan I will actually really think like then I was like eh like quite sad lah like
they are somebody's
err
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad lah
ya
you have any wishes
ya man
ya man
because my my
you think what
that's why why is he even the president
oi
baby love

ya I mean why you do you want to be there for your intership like what would you gain or
what could you possibly not learn from before that you know at school
that's weird
hmm
ah
there's there's
is it the same as our here is that how you all sit at
mm
mm
mm
to um
mm
mm
they just go there to like see whether like oh like everything like ah okay I go lah and ask
mm
they'll go
oh is it
mm mm mm mm
to
ya
then you turn around then you see that eh you know like
um
huh
ya
it's not at can I take it out
huh
you go ah
ya
then you call in then you should call in to first and ask what what what they can do
you know like say help aryan aryan
correct correct you can definitely uh look up
unless if you cannot find whatever that you're you you want to know online then no choice ah you need to go down what
and then if your mum
you know like cannot go down you go down first lah like check it out for her what's the problem
that some some people just think that we actually don't want to help them
you know because like we want to do the easy way out
but actually we really cannot help
don't want change colour
ah
oh okay
mm
huh
nothing to do with race what
eww aryan
but that time you say you want interview right
eh
Ministry of Manpower
for
wait what sorry for the that what position
oh
what what what what will you do if you get the job like what will you do
dormitory
ah okay okay
mm mm mm mm mm
why
oh is it
but then the pay is is the same ah
as
that one higher ah
november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
err actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation lor
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya lah I pass
so
you know that day I went for uh a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
and white lodge is um
it's a private uh institution
ya it's a private err it's a private school lah it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's uh it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge um
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in ah okay like the the one I went I went uh from eight thirty to one
I have to err assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates lah but they are they are like
one teacher err to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then um
after that the okay so what I did was like uh
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
um I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children lah um okay the first half the eight thirty to
um
for kids that uh the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
ang moh
and then mixed race like japanese and ang moh
like um japanese and japanese korean and uh sweden
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local one
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international uh so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
orh ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
eight thirty to five lah
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because uh if you go under government
saturday you're uh open half day
then you need to alternate working ah
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this one like saturday sunday you are closed and then what I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower lah
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see uh what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
colourful
colourful characters lah like
err and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the uh
they call me they call me miss
hu
because they don't my my name is very long right then like uh okay never mind uh just okay just call me miss hu
okay then after that they
oh got one kid say uh miss hu can I go to the toilet please
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
um can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like whoa eh
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
go to school on that day right
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so ah
a'ah
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this uh one um one
uh no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
uh one kid is err
ya
half german half japanese so
um
tell us like okay uh
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like uh and then the kids will like orh then they will uh
uh
attempt to attempt to say the language also lah
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because uh the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys lah girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime uh they uh then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
mm
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already dah
feed breakfast lah
they have like a snack lah like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that uh doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one kan
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later lah
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
err when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring lah
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no uh you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like oh my god uh and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

okay
so
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
okay
why it is sad like
like ah okay
oh
ah
oh
oh
ah oh
wah
but then how ah like
ya
why so weird
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
oh
uh huh
uh huh
what
but that's really your favourite movie
wah
err
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show oh then ah my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
um they suddenly
um
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
all of them I think almost all of them get married
ya
kan like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young lah so the thing is like he's err like professor in this like
like um over the years kan they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like ah people who are like basically like
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met ah through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
um you know like straightaway
like realise eh tomorrow you gonna get married this person
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world lor
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing lah that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool kan I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker lah don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
oh
oh ya you told me what
oh ya ya the cafe thing then
oh ya ya ya ya ya
oh
wah
oma spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
farrer park ya but the thing is
very circular
actually ya
uh huh
like tough what
but you know
ya but it's not
ya
eh
ya
maybe you are just like picky
tea without sugar can but coffee oh because of the bitterness kan
it's just weird
K lah okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
you can fulfil lah okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so um out of these three kan like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay lah have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
lee kuan yew no ah is it you can be rich I can't remember
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know what
what
okay I think that's a bit far oh
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
mmhmm
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries lah our neighbouring countries lah
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries lah if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore ah no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
like you know
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun kan
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case lah
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot lah hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is eh you know the train one
oh my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay lah um
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
no but maybe maybe because like
what you doing there huh uh you never read the sign is it
eh ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like oh my god
like ah like the maid was shocked lah when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya because it's okay lah but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
um you need to
like you can achieve now lah I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy lah to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
huh
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and uh cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia ah and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya lah but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary ah
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya
so can use that
err if it there's one country my wish list lah
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young lah I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like naruto like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing lah last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly naruto come in ya ah pokemon all this you know and then I was like
oh my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
wah
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like osaka kyoto tokyo
and I when nara I went like kanazawa then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no lah I went with my friend but I went um I think I went hiroshima alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter eh wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing lor
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like tokyo and osaka they rarely snow I think
tokyo ya tokyo rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
oh you didn't know I went korea oh my god
I showed you ya
oh my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only ah it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have ah thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no lah I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
wei you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition mah
ya
no lah um I think K because
most of them lah actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so uh it's their first language lah english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
um you know the seoul tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya wei you didn't know I went all these wah it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also lah that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper what
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in temasek my microsoft
korea bought my bags mah
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
ya
oh you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
huh
I feel like going with your friend kan
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went batam with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like oh no I cannot eat it's oh no like this place is
but then he was like then ya and then he was like why why the hotel smell then I'm like
hotel supposed to smell that way you know
and then we went massage right ya like yes then he was like why is the machine like so weak
I'm like
if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
oh ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage lah
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment err one star price then I was like
alamak why you like that
and then um
then then I was like
ya then okay
so okay how about you which country you would like to go
korea
I I'm looking at cause you cannot run what unless you wanna join like fun did you
but korean got nothing much though
eh yo yo america
there's so many things
okay lah but
but you've been to europe turkey was in europe
ya but it is europe
it it they are part of europe
they look you know you know you went to like turkey and then there's they have like the greece infrastructure and everything it looks exactly the same
you know right like you the whole europe have that same infrastructure that you see
ya
but europe is
I think for me is quite boring unless you go like paris
um
yes sightsee
drink coffee
no drink tea you don't like coffee
then you should go you will afal
I think afal entertain you
ya right he will entertain you like
cause of school what you also will be busy next year after you know I don't know it depends where you go
business lah like it's the safest choice
ya
just don't go science
I don't know I think it's
ah nursing
like really nursing

no but the thing is like you know ah inshira
you call her what ah christina or inshira
huh
then I saw his ah her she say very stressful
iskandar also in nursing what
ya
a'ah
no but
very difficult
ya
but it depends lah if you think it's fulfilling then you should go for it
no but it's not easy
but it's stable
it's stable income but there's no progression though
like ya but it's
no I think you shouldn't go nursing eh
but okay lah malinah
did nursing mah she's doing quite well
which one

like really fine
huh
ya but you will care about money soon enough really
like what
oh
ya but
oh I get it like she's
doing something in your life

wah
oh that's nice
I like beef boat noodles
oh ya we've been to thailand also
you went with your friends
only oh chey I thought

I thought it would be more expensive
ya I know I know it's like
I know I know they have that like they have that malaysia mah but malaysia one super cheap it's like one ninety ringgit eh
ya
I also never tried before
no but you have to know that they are old

nonsense lah
okay so
ya
K K K
then last okay okay it's like oh my god it's almost like one hour eh K maybe okay we ask one last question K one last question time to sleep

then okay what question you wanna ask do you have any question you wanna ask
ya
what that's so random
no ah we're talking what
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail what if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting lah
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other kan
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between kan ya
mmhmm
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a suria actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
mmhmm
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no lah like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch
no ya big bang and then after that I was like oh my god I found a website like no no not not no err because like I my friend bought the whole
I think ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me lah then I watch everything finish then I stopped watching already because the only reason why I watch Netflix is because of that
ya unless I won't use it so actually I wanted to subscribe I tell you ah like I just want to try so I actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never lah then you guys all use free I never rely on anyone lah ya I very independent
you know I have always been independent not like you guys isn't it true
huh
ya I know
why
no but the air cooler
but it's not even cold
it's not bad
no but it's a waste ya it's a waste

I thought of buying Gongcha eh what's my favourite drink
eh you know oh my god
eh
ya I thought I thought you forget sia
eh can lah after this ah
okay I buy Gongcha you with your Liho and then chicken rice ons pe

ya
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
okay what is it
ya
oh
so this will be your third wish lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like uh
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich what
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for um
is benefit for myself and my family lah
so we can bring whole family go shopping together ha
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere lah
when you got a big family right it's much easier
ah rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen uh we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood lah eh if anybody
ah emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
ah so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money ha
everything about money lah eh
because although once you being rich you still think about money ah that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
uh stable financial eh
ride their own bicycle to school ah kan
so from there also safe you see everything think about money eh
I already think very far lah kan
ya
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
then after that
ah you say that you read about the news kan
ah but like what
two months' time right about two months' time so okay lah not bad lah
so why not then
so at least if we can use that uh one hundred uh dollar voucher lah
we can save up money save up some money lah
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
mm
uh huh
mmhmm
ya correct
mmhmm
mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm
um you know that uh
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
ah they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you lah
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest uh maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso kan
mm so like that better right
mm
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
err
ya lah marina is nice ah
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mm
mmhmm
splash
mm
mmhmm
mmhmm
I think that one is quite cheap also
because um that time I saw a youtuber
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this lah
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
ah
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
ah so maybe we can go for that one ah
mm so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you ah so we no need to go for separate rooms what
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk ah
cannot gathering ah cannot make side illegal gathering
ah cannot gossip ah
so at least at least lah mm so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that lah
mmhmm
mmhmm
have lah
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle ah I not sure
but they can uh ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride ha
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part lah that we can do
ah
maybe we can plan saturday morning
mm no maybe afternoon
oh ya because actually we don't want
um
we don't want
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
mmhmm
the next morning we go cycling
oh over there if I not wrong got burger king eh
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin ah
ya that's why
but I think uh over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure ah
hmm maybe we can search everything
um
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
mmhmm mmhmm
ya
mmhmm
mmhmm
I don't like to roller blade lah actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see seh don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay lah nevermind lah
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
alah huh
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it lah
like that lor
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct lah it's boring lah because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
ya very very cold
mmhmm ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
wah we die
mmhmm
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I aiyo if I go there eh
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly ah if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious ah they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
a'ah
mmhmm
ya
ya lah I think um
will love it okay will love it
the one that is suggest just now
it's a nice view lah
ya
not bad right
we really don't have enough time for each other also
but got zipline or not
oh ya kallang right
rock climbing right oh ya ya ya
ya that's why but if I not wrong need to pay you know
I know
if I not wrong have
maybe we can buy some snack ah
but you know like this kind of
always have uh family gathering kan
mm
they
ya but you need to book also you know
a'ah
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside alamak inside your tent
oh ya we should have a receipt eh mm
after we already book we should have a receipt ah
hmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
mmhmm
a'ah
mm hey ya
ya

ya
mmhmm

ya
ya okay lah
who going to cook
me everything is me
ya lah drinks everything lah
ya lah
mmhmm
mmhmm mmhmm if like
hmm
a'ah

we will ask for off day
on saturday because sunday is already his off day what
mmhmm

um
um
I think that mango is just rare lah in singapore too if they sell
oh why is it my favorite food um
um
um
the type the types of mango that ah my
the types of mango my ah my brother
I like I don't know how to describe but just mango is just my favorite lah
mango kan and it's a fruit
perfect
and also it's also and it's also healthy
like my brother said um
ya it ya it's sunshine
shine your day you know like brightens your day up you know when you eat mango
so um
you know
oh um
so um other than that um I
other than that
err
like
I don't know eh like um
mango is just
mango is just everything ah to me like
um
you can just
you know like make juice you can make a cake you can make a puff
you can make everything with mango because mango is just
amazing
pudding right
they
ya they they process like syrup for us to you know to
to drink as a
just for an everyday drink you know
because mango just
you can do whatever you want with mango
like literally anything you want with mango because
mango is just like you know
we can't talk much about mango because
like what my brother said everyday everyday we eat mango
we
we like
rarely talk about it you know
uh this topic came out from my brother
don't know how to talk about mango because mango is just so many things um so many things to talk about so
like
you know it's all stuck inside our heads like we cannot think of it but then
you know it's just mango
of course not
but we can make it you know
make a new recipe
because
like we said mm huh mango we can do anything with it mm huh we can just do anything with mango
so you can just put like what Sprite
smash up the mango and then make it a mango soda you know
of course not
one of it is you know sometimes when you leave your mango outside for too long
um
you know when you leave your mango outside for too long and and then you never eat it like for a long time and then
when you will have the appetite to eat it er
after that while
then when you start to you know peel off the mango and then you see this um rotten part of the mango
then you taste the rotten part of mango and then
your appetite is just lost
but other than that um
uh this is why we have to um always keep our mangoes fresh
and keeps our mango um
um keep our mangoes fresh and then keep like um you know inside the fridge what to let it cool so that it won't rotten that fast
and um
other than that uh
uh ya it's ah after you like what he said like um
and then you blend it
it will definitely taste like ice cream like
it's like a mango yogurt ice cream you know something like that you know like
um
like a smashed mango but then it's frozen
it's cold it's like not it's like it's like not the normal eh err mango is just like
you know like
ice cream tasty like
mango you know
and um
for me personally I like mangoes that are cold
because I
don't like um
because I
like summer days ah you know when you eat this
oh my god
I totally forgot about it also
yeah and
oh my god how can we forget about that
when you eat during that hot weather and it melts in your mouth
you can taste the mango inside you can taste the freshness inside
when you uh after you exercise or after you
I tell you all it's really really really really nice
ah
um as per normal my day has been going great
err obviously
and ya today I've ah today I started school a bit later because um as per as per usual I always wake up late
but I will still attend to school and then um after school I will I will always work
and that's all I have to do find money
make myself happy pamper myself you know because
sometimes we have to love ourselves more
and make us eh make ourselves happy more happy ya
so how about your day
for me eh
actually
like just I heck care everybody I'm just going to do it

I didn't get to taste my mom's food
up to you bro
what about our favorite music

because my type of
personality I like this hype song

very very like it's not spicy
but
yeah
even if
and then you see all these food porns you know it's like
oh tenderfresh eh um tenderfresh it's like an average price
it others are ah there's some food that is expensive but then there's some food that is also cheap
like it's just um how what what's the word that they call um

whoa
okay
I would ask for a a car
shoes
for anything any type of shoes I would want
so ya
so what about you akid
okay okay
you know what I mean
so ya
hmm
genie
genie the people who grant your wishes
genie
but I also think genie also have their own set of rules that you cannot ask for more wishes of these things what
you never know you know never know
the world is like super mysterious what
hmm
ah since I already have money right
but I only can ask for this much amount of money
so right if I want to buy shoes right
the money would confirm go down right
ah if I just for unlimited amount of shoes for any type of sports I want right
my money won't go down and I still have time for shoes what
so you get where I'm going from
for my love life I think
these two things already I think is already up there to get like
the girls I want not saying they're they're gold-diggers or anything but like
I'm saying that it would help me
a part to get girls lah like a love my love life to kickstart my love life I would say
so ya
so what so what
why you keep talking to me about your love life akid
what is wrong with your love life
because like you know err
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
easy to say it's like it won't be good ah everything will just be everything oh I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate ah so like
so like you know ah sometimes right you need to think about
worth it ah
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life ah for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
ah
I mean everybody has their own opinion what
their own opinions in life
chey just joking but ya of course ah I want a pretty lady in my life and
uh show respect to my parents like that kind of girl ah
in that's what I look for in a girl ah
mm
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say lah like too playful ah
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she's a good mix in between ah like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall ah
but then turns out I'm not her type ah so if that that one I cannot do anything ah but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course ah every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus ah
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want ah I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
whoa
ah
process ah
process your morning
ah okay
a'ah
mm
it was just like out the blue ah
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first first everything lah
it's like your first breakup ah you don't know how to handle lah
oh
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments what but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs what
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like oh this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated ah some would say
so ya
but then when she
labels ah I would say
mm
so you just became like a emotional guy ah
like you just needed like reasons ah like you want to solve it ah like you don't want to just breakup
like that ah
so like you try to you know talk to her lah but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you ah
she
move on ah so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky lah your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good ah because like
so like ya lah
a'ah seh
in this world ah
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
a'ah
oh okay okay okay
so what did you leave her for someone
mm
mm
mm
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
mm
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings ah
ya
ah
ah
oh that's good that's good
ah to be honest ah
it depends on how the break up went ah
it's like
ya
so like
what's the point kan ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't ah
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends ah
do you still searching for love or anything
ah
oh
ah
ah okay
mmhmm
mm
eh
mm
ah
you just try to care for her lah like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares ah
ah
that's
that's a super hard question ah because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended ah
like
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on lah
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this one
were you still moving on
ya
mm
your second girl your ex lah
ah
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that ah
it's like something that is lost can never be found again ah
people say this one
so like ya
ugh
ya
totally not wrong
mm
in my in my relationships ah my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me ah I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now ah like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course ah I I I feel like sometimes I
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn ah
so like ah
mm
it's like you just live ah like your future self think about that in the future ah I get what you mean
so like ya like you know ah
you always got to know ah sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship ah so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
ah go the way you want it to then
sorry man
life is doesn't work in your favour all the time
mm
ah
like you know it's like don't think too much ah pretty much don't put ah
oh I don't have money now what should I do
or should work and earn my money like that
you know like you never know you might just blink your eye and then you be thirty plus forty plus in the future

their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing what
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya lah then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya lah then how to bribe
ya lah
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
mm islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own

so people added her
she gains more attention by that
ha
no
no
for what
because ya
so sis feel that
hmm
then
I tried what once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say lah because when I see a people a girl wearing niqab err I have expectation on them ah
a'ah lah
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
no wonder lah you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief lah like I wanted to add lah that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear ah
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering jer
a'ah
mmhmm
big
big build ya
ya
then how ah
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that err
because we will be looking so dull
still
what's the word ah the the the
ya ringarde I don't want to be ringarde
but
ya lah
true lah
and the creator
ya so like
like being fashion
being looking like
ya
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
you just want to

shiq
like
in this life
like what would you ask for
I see I see I see
to be honest
like
because
uh but I would I would say money
err
money
err
a good
love life
err and health to all my
so ya that's why I would ah I would want lah
to me ah
err
genie
actually believe ya ya ya
ya true
but
but like like
how what about like uh
relationships
like what I said ah about love life and like bringing err health to my family like what do you think about that ah
ya like like why why won't you wish for like a promised err and err a love life
something something like that ah mm
I mean um
I mean my love life it's
it's been a lot ah
for
all my life
it's been a ride lah in terms of my love life or my err
so like
ya to me like
for it's
it's important because
I think like if you live without love and like
err
I think you can live life right ah I think you will live a good life or I think like that ah like
err
think about
I mean
I mean like one more thing about
uh
kan
okay one more another
uh
your life is easy ah life is simple and like
if everything you want you get no you don't have to work hard for it
ya like
as in ya lah
so
ya that's that's that's what's up
but ya in terms
in terms of my life
like
okay um
uh in a girl for you to you know
basically uh
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable lah like I don't think everyone would
eh ah like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that ah so like
catch my eye is err is the girl funny ah to me if they're funny
to me if they're funny
I mean like uh
if I would say myself this is called green flag ah for like if they can make me laugh
like a lot of the girls lah
maybe I I think it's biased a bit
it's quite biased because a lot of the girls
you know
and ya I've only met like what
so ya like and another quality is I would say that's achievable
um
so what you think ah
I mean you're being very honest already ah with me like been telling uh yours your
stories about your ex
like I want I want to be honest ah also like share
with you about mine my first one was
ah
a'ah
but then like
uh I will just uh
and then uh I went for it I went for it and then
ah sweat and then
and what would I want to what would I want to answer right like I I I don't know if I can think properly ah
ah
hi like uh I think you're I think you're pretty and um you know you seem like such a a nice girl to you know talk to and err I hope you don't mind if uh if I wanted to be friends with you ah
and uh
ah switch off switch on
freshen up
she doesn't mind ah so I was like uh wow
was like oh wow and then my reply was oh wow I didn't expect her to be because I
I was in a fifty fifty ah thing ah where I expect her
uh you know I will just
overjoyed ah I was over I was just overjoyed ah and excited to you know ah talk to her and then she said like she didn't mind and then I
err oh wow
I didn't expect her to reply and then uh
so we we talk and then after that we started to talk ah she was like replying
constantly and then uh
ah
oh K K
in her and I was like
in front of my me
ah
and then
it went ah it went well
uh it went well until
you know she was
the first day lah
ah
and then uh
you know you were happy and then we went our first date ah
okay ah everything went well and then at this one point ah
and then she and then like
ah she just said that
um
the whole thing
like your first
uh huh
as in
oh
almost everything ah and then
uh
ah
they didn't
you could say that uh you could say that it was long ah
and it was my the first time what so I didn't know what to do so I was like
and when I was in denial I was like
still uh
I wouldn't say want to force ah it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her lah but maybe maybe it was ah
it was just so heartbreaking ah you know for me
ah
cold also she said thanks that's all like literally that's all
and then that was I guess
err the last straw ah
final one
ya
ah then ya then basically I just move on ah because it was my first I don't know what to do I feel scared
so I just I had to move on with life and I did ah somehow I did
I mean I guess it was good for me ah I was the first
you know and uh you cannot expect the first to be your last
I mean um
that's one
err but I guess
a'ah lah
as in example ah
um
the second one
the second one okay the second one
for feeling this way because
she was my second and I'm already having
okay so this my second ah it was in my
my you know uh it was my first year in NITEC
and
err I saw her ah
and then
contact ah and then
and uh just looking around ah I'm just like
and then
same thing you know
ah I was excited you know again I felt that way somewhat I fell away again
and then you know we talk know I was excited I was entertained
she was very funny
okay she was very funny um
uh I like her ah pretty much the from the start I was like I like
ah
I never thought like it would be with this girl and then like
and you know we went to dates we went to everything she was funny know she entertain me she understood me err
you know again
this
uh
um
err
she's not feeling it anymore ah
and
ah
and then again ah like like just the previous one again like again everything I thought it was going good you know and
I saw her as this girl that
she was just perfect ah in even in her most
a touchy thing to say so ya and I'm being honest ah like she was like even in her imperfectness I saw perfectness ah so
she was my ideal girl ah in
in in fact ah you know like
so when she said that I was like
in shock and like again I took it
I I can say I took it better than the previous one ah how I took it was better
you know
so I say like and and then when I tried to like talk her out of it I talk about the last relationship the last relationship like how I went to go with it you know how I pestered
so I told her like ah okay lah then I cannot do anything about it
I just want you to be happy ah that's
so
err
and I'll I still do ah still do care about her ah
um
you know and she's
amazing ah so till this day she's still amazing ah and
so I move on with uh my life and she move on with hers so she give
she give me her closure in her own way and uh you know
we stick out we somehow made it as a friends ah you know
ya so ya I guess somehow we made it as friends you could say friends ah till this day because we still
mm
ah
I think she got with like
err in total like
two guys after me so
and then
ah
we were just friends time and time again I will ask about her I will ask her like how's
how it was good how it was going you know for her
and
because I truly cared for her ah like I could say after the break up I
even till this day I could say that
I would say I still think like about her like what she's doing like how is she is she fine
and
on occasionally as I said ah I would ask her ah
you know she also ask me like how am I doing and like
update me on some stuff
then to me it's fine ah I think to me what we have is
I think I believe that both of us what I believe is we both have
we like to believe that we both have moved on ah and I think I moved on
like in fair enough to say I moved on ah just that I just care about her as as some as someone
who
was special to me at one point in my life
and then um
we so we just kept in contact and then I met this girl
err and she was also with another man
if I'm not wrong ah
no ah it was very mature ah for me it was mature ah as much as
it was a mature relationship between me and her it's not like we meet meet still meet up or what you know
ah
err
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days ah some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone ah I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
ah
something like that ah
oh ah
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now err
I was
still in process ah honestly I was still in process ah low-key I was still in process
but
err
somehow I I
I move on ah I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is ah and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
err I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
ah I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
um
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay ah maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening ah
but it feels it feels like a crime ah sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having ah because I really love what we are having already ah so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good ah
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask lah like
what what what went wrong
ah
okay so it's like
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride ah I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous ah
my previous
girl lah and
to me it's fine I guess you know uh as you said also I think it's fine ah
so and it's okay ah
um
mm
but
doing my best as well ah so if it goes to where
but if not
like
uh
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
okay okay
first thing
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is uh
you know I learnt how to accept
err
third thing thing is uh I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time ah
um
true ya what you said is true ah and
ya and then you know those are the three lessons ah
and
uh I guess so far it's been great ah when
I don't want to say
I don't want to say she's my last
but I hope so
good thing like in what way
or like
err
ah

err
ah
oh
ah
mmhmm
mm
a'ah
ah
mm
ah
ah
huh
then after that err
if she's with her boyfriend ah you are fighting ah
you are fighting against ah you're fighting for her with the boyfriend
stephen stephen chow
ah
a'ah
ya
it's true ah
it makes sense ah cause like I mean like
it's not written anywhere tau
but that's the funny thing like a lot of people say french people are more romantic kan but at the same time french people are much more open
uh huh
ya
and how we are actually romanticised by all these things that humans
we believe it's such negative which actually weakens us tau
okay lah
a'ah
but for us we assume he know and second thing we assume that he will get offended
we expect that from an adult but when it comes to baby kan
one week of work
like that towards my wife as well that kind of thing lah cause
this kind of thing ah
ya
ah yes yes yes
ya

ah
to a certain extent I agree with ragging cause it toughens a man
like
kids kan okay if you are rich
err
you just even all these things kan they give all these things then after that
ah if you can talk nicely you talk nicely you don't beat me
that's the right time to hit

mm
mmhmm
a'ah
a'ah
romantics kan believe in
is the person who you don't know
ah
the language of love ah in a way
the love that they are they they are looking for kan is the err how much suffering
so that ratio need to match with yours ah
oh
a'ah
mm
ah
cringey oh
it's just that you are aware you are more aware of
some of the things that you talk about ah

that's why
just simple as that ah
ah this is also one ah shopping for a guy is so hard what do you guys like beside other girls' pictures
talk to him and want something from him
a'ah
that's the thing okay about romanticism kan okay there's
is quite
toxic ah is when you
that's why there's this research ah woman fall in love when they hit orgasm
most most likely they fall in love when they hit orgasm
they want to make it happen cause they don't want to make it seem that they are hoe
a'ah
a'ah
when you place yourself like okay you're my true love
I can only have sex with you
more than me
what she gives me
he may not give me but what you give me
is something that she cannot
give me and what you give me is something that I want ah
overthinking ah ah but at the end of the day there there's a lot of factors that contribute to this ah
one she's alone overseas
romanticism
and you are offended
I don't know what else to talk about
happiness is happiness by itself ah
cause you don't compare yours with another people ya
like okay
